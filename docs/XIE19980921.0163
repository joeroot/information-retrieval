New Oil Field Found in South China Sea
BEIJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The China National Offshore Oil Corp ( CNOOC ) has discovered a new oilfield in the Pearl River Basin in the South China Sea with geological oil reserves estimated at 20 million tons .
The new offshore field , called Panyu 4 - 2 , is located some 160 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong in the 15 / 34 block of the South China Sea and has been contracted by the Santa Fe company of the United States .
According to the CNOOC source , the 15 / 34 block was contracted to Santa Fe in January 1997 .
So far , a group of oil and gas - bearing structures including Panyu 2 - 1 , Panyu 4 - 2 , and Panyu 9 - 2 have been found in the block .
Experts believe the newly discovered Panyu 4 - 2 oilfield is rich in oil and gas reserves , with an oil layer 169.2 meters thick .
A CNOOC official noted that the discovery of Panyu 4 - 2 has proved to be another major breakthrough following the Xijiang 34 - 3 oil-bearing structure in the basin of the Pearl River in the South China Sea .
Experts expect the offshore Panyu area to be the fifth group of oilfields in the eastern part of the Pearl River Basin after the successful exploration of oilfield groups of Huizhou , Xijiang , Lufeng and Liuhua .
