Lesotho Opposition Denies Coup
JOHANNESBURG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Lesotho opposition parties Monday denied a South African newspaper report that they had overthrown the government of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and taken charge of the mountain kingdom in a coup .
The Star newspaper reported Monday morning that the opposition alliance had staged a coup and quoted Lesotho Foreign Minister Tom Thabane as saying that his government had been unseated .
The newspaper also reported that Mosisili and several other ministers had fled the country .
It said opposition alliance spokeswoman Mamello Morrison had confirmed that the opposition had taken charge of Lesotho .
However , South African Press Association ( SAPA ) quoted Morrison as saying : " The ( newspaper ) report is a poor attempt at sensationalism and is a highly irresponsible statement .
As far as a coup is concerned they are telling a blatant lie .
There is no coup in Lesotho . "
Morrison said she had told The Star 's reporter only that the government had abandoned control of the country and that the opposition would soon be in control .
" I said nothing of a coup .
I am a former journalist and a woman of sober habits .
The reporter who claimed I said this either needs training in the English language or on how to interpret information . "
Morrison said opposition demonstrators Monday again gathered at the gates of the royal palace in Maseru to continue their protest against the outcome of Lesotho 's general election in May .
" We are singing , the normal contingent of army personnel is still here .
There is no coup in the country . "
South African officials were unable to confirm the coup report .
According to SAPA , army officers stood guard at the entrance of Mosisili 's residence Monday morning and there were no indication that the prime minister had fled the country .
