EDITORIAL : THE AGING BOYS OF BARCELONA

The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday , June 2 :
Michael Jordan had just enough energy left on Sunday night to forklift the Chicago Bulls into yet another National Basketball Association final .
That seemed fitting , since it is hard to imagine a final without Jordan .
It is even harder to imagine rooting against him in his twilight years , but the seditious thought occurs that there may actually be more people pulling for his opponents , the Utah Jazz , an admirable and workmanlike team that lost to the Bulls in the final round last year .
The Bulls have Jordan and the great Scottie Pippen , himself no spring chicken , and each has five championship rings .
The Jazz also come equipped with a couple of elderly all-stars , Karl `` The Mailman '' Malone and John Stockton , but unlike Michael and Scottie , these two have never won a championship .
In terms of public sentiment , Stockton and Malone are thus in much the same position as John Elway was in January .
The Denver quarterback , nearing the end of an otherwise brilliant career , had never won a Super Bowl .
When he finally prevailed against a favored Green Bay team , there was a universal feeling that justice had been served .
Whatever the outcome , this should be an interesting series to watch , not least because the four future Hall of Famers who will give the series its emotional content are also disciplined playmakers of the old school .
Jordan , 35 , is unquestionably the greatest player of all time .
Pippen , the babe of the bunch at 32 , is superb at both ends of the court .
Malone , 34 , is still the game 's premier power forward , and Stockton , 35 , defines what an unselfish , slick-passing point guard ought to be .
All four were members of the original Dream Team in 1992 , the first U.S. Olympic squad composed largely of professional players , which won the gold medal in Barcelona with an average victory margin of 44 points a game .
They are older now , and in a few years will all be gone .
It is nice to have a chance to catch their magic one more time .
