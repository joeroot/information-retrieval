OPEC Production Quota Proposed to Decrease
JAKARTA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- President of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) I.B .
Sudjana said here Friday that OPEC 's 27.5 million barrel per day ( bpd ) production quota could be lowered to stabilize the price of oil in the international market .
Production quotas could be lowered if all oil ministers from OPEC member countries approved , Sudjana , who is also Indonesia 's mines and energy minister , said .
The statement followed a call made by Sudjana Thursday , which urged OPEC to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the fall of international crude oil prices and the impact of higher of Iraqi oil production .
The price of Brent North Sea oil in London on Thursday was only 14.03 U.S. dollars per barrel .
one of the reasons for the fall of oil prices was seemingly a result of the united Nations ' approval of a plan for Iraq to boost its crude oil exports to 1.5 million bpd , up 900,000 bpd from 600,000 bpd for each six-month period .
Another reason for the lower oil price is an oversupply caused by diminished industrial demand for oil in nations experiencing economic turbulence .
Sudjana said here on Friday that most OPEC member countries also want higher oil prices so a plan to convene a meeting was fully supported by all ministers .
" At the meeting , the organization will optimize supervision over the possibility of quota violations .
An OPEC monitoring minister will be necessary in the matter , " he said .
Sudjana said on Thursday that if OPEC ministers agreed to meet , the conference would be held in Vienna after Indonesia 's presidential election next month .
