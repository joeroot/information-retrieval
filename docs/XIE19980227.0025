Infants not Breastfed Risk Higher Mortality Rate
LUSAKA , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Infants who are not breastfed are 14 times more likely to die from diarrhoea and three times more likely to die from acute respiratory infections compared to those who are breastfed , a Zambian official said here Thursday .
Director of Gender in Development Division at Cabinet Office Auxilia Ponga said that lack of exclusive breastfeeding up to two years and beyond is a significant cause of common preventable infant and early childhood infections which result in malnutrition .
She told a mother support group convention that the full potential of exclusive breastfeeding for the health of infants , especially in the prevention of infections and for optimal birth spacing has not been realized .
Some traditional practices and transcultural influences in the urban setting especially among the affluent population , prevent optimum breastfeeding practices , she said .
The convention is attended by representatives from mother support systems from four provinces including Lusaka with a view to sharing their experiences and coming up with viable recommendations to improve the running of the support systems .
The mother support systems are community based child health and growth promoters .
On the same occasion Funny Kondolo from the National Food and Nutrition Commission said that 46 health facilities have been declared baby friendly , and 100 mother support systems have been formed in seven of the all nine provinces across the country .
This is a big achievement as the formation of a mother support system is not an easy thing to do , she said .
