Health Canada Extends Toy Warning to Pets
OTTAWA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Canadian pet owners have been warned to keep their animals away from soft vinyl products , which could secrete a dangerous chemical when chewed or sucked .
" If you have concerns , you should remove the products from the pet 's environment and dispose of them , " said Health Canada spokesman Stephen Jeffery .
Health Canada had previously warned parents of small children to keep their children from vinyl toys .
Given the fact that animals habitually chew toys for much longer time than infants do , the department later also extended the warning to pets amid mounting concerns from cat and dog owners .
" If a substance is toxic for humans it is almost always toxic for animals , " said Diane Mckelvey , spokeswoman for the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association .
" Puppies ...
just love to chew .
And it 's not uncommon for them to swallow bits of plastic toys , " she said .
According to tests cited by Health Canada , soft vinyl toys contain up to 44 percent of their weight in phthalates , a type of chemical that has been shown to cause liver and kidney damage in laboratory animals .
