BELGRADE , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said Saturday that the Kosovo crisis is expected to be solved politically within this year , reported the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug .
Schuessel , whose country is holding the rotating presidency of the European Union ( EU ) , made the remark in a visit to Banja Luka , a northeastern city of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
" If the dialogue can be guaranteed to start , a political solution is expected to be found to solve the Kosovo crisis by the end of this year , " Schuessel said .
More efforts have been made to increase political contacts over the issue , he added .
Schuessel expressed satisfaction over the " humanitarian situation " in Kosovo , saying that the ceasefire accord has been generally observed .
When asked to comment on the ethnic Albanian representatives ' refusal to open a dialogue with the Belgrade authorities , Schuessel said he hoped " wise political leaders ( of the ethnic Albanians ) will prevail . "
