COWBOYS ' SANDERS UNDERGOES ANKLE SURGERY
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By JOSIE KARP c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Deion Sanders underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left ankle yesterday in Miami , the Cowboys announced .
Dr. John Uribe removed a bone spur from the cornerback 's ankle .
The injury occurred over time , Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said .
Sanders underwent a similar operation in 1995 .
Recovery and rehabilitation time will take from four to six weeks , Maurer said .
That means Sanders could miss the beginning portion of training camp when the team convenes in Wichita Falls in mid-July .
In three seasons with the Cowboys , Sanders has attended training camp only once , in 1996 .
When he was originally signed before the 1995 season the Cowboys were already through with training camp and last season he played baseball while his teammates practiced in Austin .
The operation could hamper the plans of first-year Cowboys coach Chan Gailey to include Sanders in the offense .
Sanders has not participated in offensive practices during off-season workouts .
