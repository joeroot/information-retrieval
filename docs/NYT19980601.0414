NEW YORK _ As all readers of `` The Wind in the Willows '' know , Mole , Rat and Badger are ever the most agreeable of companions .
And if Toad of Toad Hall is sometimes self-absorbed and silly and in need of a good talking-to , well , that makes life among the characters created by Kenneth Grahame in his classic tale of friendship in the English countryside all the more enjoyable .
So it is surely a pleasure to see these eternal friends brought to life once again , this time in the equally agreeable New Victory Theater , where an ambitious musical version of the 1908 children 's novel is playing through June 14 .
If this collaboration between the upstate resident theater company Syracuse Stage and professors , recent graduates and students of Syracuse University falls somewhere short of the pure enchantment and innovative Orwellian political vision of last year 's short-lived film version , it is nevertheless a colorful , cheery , tuneful and spirited return to Ratty 's river , Toad Hall and the unfriendly confines of the Wild Wood .
As adapted and directed ( with Anthony Salatino ) by Gerardine Clark , a professor in the Syracuse University Drama Department who also wrote the intelligent lyrics , this production hits the high spots of the novel .
These include the meeting of Mole and Rat ; their truncated outing with Toad in his gypsy caravan ; the beginning of Toad 's motor-car mania ; Mole 's excursion into the Wild Wood ; refuge with Badger ; Toad 's jailing and escape ; the takeover of Toad Hall by the weasels and stoats , and the friends ' ultimate triumph .
The youthful cast is a definite plus .
Both as a singer and as an actor , Eric Collins makes a delightful Mole ; the clear-voiced , athletic Timothy A. Fitz-Gerald proves an agile Rat , and Michael Poignand creates a properly dignified , wise and thoughtful Badger .
Lee Zarrett works hard as Toad , and Price Waldman makes a strong impression as the magistrate who sentences the imprudent Toad to 19 years in prison .
The consistently melodic score by Dianne Adams McDowell and James McDowell is highlighted by the title tune , and the set by Beowulf Boritt , the costumes by Mirena Rada , the lighting by A. Nelson Ruger IV , the sound by David Schnirman and the sound effects of James Wildman all play a powerful , unified role in evoking the ambiance of the novel and the spirit of the familiar Ernest H. Shepard illustrations .
One could wish for a bit more in the way of dance ( there 's a funny tango , though ) ; English accents that remember not to stray occasionally across the Atlantic ; an elimination of the magistrate 's final cackles , and a more generous helping of inventive humor .
But as long as there is an engrossed child in the audience , as there was on opening night , who helps out ( and brings down the house ) by shouting , `` He went that way '' when Toad escapes Mole 's custody , all is well _ very well , indeed _ at Toad Hall .
