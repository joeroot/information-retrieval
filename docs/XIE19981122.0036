Russia , Japan to Increase Regional Cooperation
MOSCOW , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Russian region of Sakhalin and the Japanese island of Hokkaido signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation on Sunday , according to the Interfax news agency .
At a press conference , Sakhalin governor Igor Farkhutdinov said a priority for such cooperation is to implement off-shore oil and gas projects in Sakhalin .
The main problem facing the Kuril Islands is energy supply and the first thing for Sakhalin and Hokkaido to do is to build a geothermal energy system on the Kuril Islands .
Hokkaido governor Tatsuya Hori said that Hokkaido companies may actively participate in the development of the resources of the Sakhalin Sea .
He added that Japanese companies , which have experience in undertaking projects in climatic conditions similar to those in Sakhalin , can be particularly useful in building houses , roads and other infrastructure projects in Sakhalin .
Both sides believed that stronger good-neighborly ties between Sakhalin and Hokkaido will help promote the bilateral relations between Russian and Japan at the turn of the century .
