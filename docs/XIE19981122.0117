Zimbabwe 's Building Material Prices Soaring
HARARE , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Prices of building materials in Zimbabwe have shot up by between 50 and 100 percent over the past few months , as the industry reacts to the continued devaluation of the Zimbabwean Dollar and the recent 68 percent fuel hike .
A survey conducted earlier this week by the Mail newspaper showed that prices of cement and other building materials had been hiked to offset increased production and overhead costs , the paper reported Sunday .
This was having a great impact on most home builders who have been forced to shelve their building projects to seek for more funds , the paper said .
Retail outlets said the price of cement had risen three times over the past four months .
Other materials like timber and paint shot up by almost 55 percent as manufacturers and retailers passed on the costs to consumers .
This year , the Zimbabwean Dollar has been devalued by about 60 percent due to worsening economic situation in the country .
