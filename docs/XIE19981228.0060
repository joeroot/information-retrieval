Nine Arrested for Faulty Embankment in Hangzhou
BEIJING , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Nine people in Hangzhou , capital of east China 's Zhejiang Province , were arrested over the weekend for the faulty construction of an embankment section on the Qiantang River , the province 's major river .
Five officials in charge of the project , including the chief of the Hangzhou embankment construction administration office , Qian Zhengzhong , and the general manager of the Hangzhou Water Conservation Engineering and Construction Cooperation , Chen Yong , were arrested on charge of bribery .
The five allegedly accepted money and gifts and awarded the project to the wrong contractors .
Lu Baoxin and three others who were responsible for building the leeway in the Xiasha section of the Qiantang River were found to have used mud instead of concrete as filling , and were accused of endangering public safety by doing shoddy work and using inferior material in a major construction project .
The provincial water conservation department has deprived the Hangzhou Water Conservation Engineering and Construction Cooperation of its right to participate in any construction bidding and has required it to reconstruct the project .
Officials in charge of supervising the construction also received administrative punishment .
The overall renovation of the Qiantang embankment began last year , and many Hangzhou residents made donations to show their support for the project .
So far , the faulty embankment section has been repaired .
