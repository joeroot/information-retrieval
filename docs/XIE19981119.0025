German " five wise men " Criticize New Bonn Government
Bonn , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Germany 's new Social Democrat-Greens coalition government came in for its first major economic policy criticism Wednesday when the panel dubbed the " five wise men " issued their forecast for the country 's economy in 1999 .
According to the report issued by the " five wise men " on Wednesday here , it will be a slowdown in German gross domestic product growth next year to just 2.0 percent , from this year 's 2.75 percent rate .
Unemployment was expected to drop to 4.1 million persons , at a rate of 10.8 percent .
This year 's joblessness average rate is 11.2 per cent .
While giving those prognosis , the panel by inference singled out finance minister Oskar Lafontaine for criticism over his political demands made in the debate over interest rates , taxes and currency policies .
" In Germany , the debate over the economic policy of the new government is dampening the mood , " the five economic professors wrote in the report , saying also they did not regard a rate cut by the European Central Bank next year as being necessary .
The report rejects the demand put forth by the finance minister Lafontaine soon after the new Bonn coalition took office , saying this demand that monetary policy should be more strongly linked to supporting the economy and improving the job situation was " not convincing " .
" There is no proof that companies and private households do not invest or consume more due to the current interest rates , " the panel report said .
The panel of professors called for a more far-reaching tax reform , while rejecting another idea by Lafontaine to try to restrict taxation competition in Europe through a harmonization of tax rates .
The report is the first that the new " Red-Green " Bonn coalition , now in power about a month , has received from the panel of five professors who are popularly dubbed the " five wise men " .
