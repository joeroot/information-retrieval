Top Airline Promotes Sales in China
BEIJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- One of the world 's major airlines has increased efforts to explore the China market as commercial aviation everywhere feels the effects of the Asian financial crisis .
United States-based United Airlines ( UA ) has reinstituted its discount promotion campaign throughout China in a bid to draw additional business from one of the most active and promising aviation market in the world .
Through its network of ticket offices and travel agents around the country , UA offers travellers from China to the U.S. discount fares of 8,888 yuan ( about 1,000 U.S. dollars ) for a round-trip ticket .
This discount fare will be available from September 19 to October 31 .
This is the second large-scale sales promotion campaign UA has conducted in China this year .
Chris Lin , general manager of UA in China , said that China has become an active and promising market for foreign airlines in the past few years , and that every new operation UA has started in the country has been successful .
China is now the only Asian country that remains attractive to long-term foreign investments .
Despite the deepening impact of the financial crisis in the rest of east Asia , China has kept its currency from devaluation , and is expected to achieve an 8 percent economic growth rate this year .
Last week , UA chose China to initiate its world-wide plan to sell electronic tickets for overseas flights .
United Airlines now accounts for 30 percent of the civil aviation market between the the U.S. and China .
It operates 14 schedule flights from Beijing and Shanghai to the U.S. every week , as well as flights from Hong Kong to the U.S.
Last year , UA had a global net income of more than 1.3 billion U.S. dollars .
