Private Entrepreneur Pulls State Businesses out of Difficulty
SHENYANG , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Gao Zhankui , the owner of a small shop with registered capital worth 200,000 yuan nine years ago , now runs an enterprise group which has 120 million yuan of assets .
" It is the restructuring of the state-owned enterprises that has provided me opportunities , " the 33-year-old man said , who is chairman of the board of directors of the private Tianma Enterprise Group in Chaoyang city , northeast China 's Liaoning Province .
He began to be involved in the industrial business until 1995 .
Before that , he was doing domestic and foreign trade business , including with Russia .
" I have not invested in any new projects in the past three years , instead , I have devoted all efforts to helping restructure state-owned enterprises , " Gao said .
He has since brought five money-losing or otherwise bankrupt state businesses out of difficulties by way of share-controlling and cooperation .
Among the five enterprises , he owns one and co-manages the other four with local government .
" Government involvement not only puts the staff workers at ease but also offers favorable policies , " the businessman said , adding that the wholly private ownership is perhaps not the best choice under present circumstances in China .
He has been making the most of the successful regulations and training managers in the state enterprises .
He has even gone so far as to hire one of the former directors to serve as general manager of his enterprise group .
" They are not burdens as widely thought , the question is how you are going to bring their initiative into full play , " the young man said .
In 1997 , he offered 38 percent of his own shares to 24 senior managers in his group .
He holds the belief that every enterprise or entrepreneur should do something for the society , and that they can be private but shouldn n't be selfish .
The local government would not intervene so long as enterprises are doing well , said Ao Jinshi , director of the city 's economic and trade commission .
China has planned to bring its debt-ridden state sector out of difficulty within three years , and therefore every possible means in this effort is allowed to try .
