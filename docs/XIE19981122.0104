Philippines to Speed Up Rural Air Transportation
MANILA , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Philippines plans to speed up the development of its rural air transport system by expanding airport facilities , especially in the remote provinces , the Philippines News Agency said Sunday .
Vicente Rivera Jr. , Secretary of Transportation and Communications , was quoted as saying that this initiative would spur economic activities in the countryside and improve the delivery of basic services to the rural folks .
Speaking before a recent conference of the International Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association ( IAOPA ) in California , the United States , he said the country " can not fully develop without a strong rural air transport system . "
Rivera asked the IAOPA to help the Philippines develop its domestic airline capability .
Stressing that his country is a developing nation with about 65 percent of its people living in poverty , Rivera said a " robust transport sector is seen as an important pre-requisite to its overall development strategy . "
