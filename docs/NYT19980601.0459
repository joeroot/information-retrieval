& HT ; Former Bulls coach remembers Jordan 's early days in NBA & HT ; By Jeffrey Denberg & HT ; c.
1998 Cox News Service
The tongue-wagging , Michael Jordan who goes after his sixth , and perhaps last NBA title this week , first surfaced the third day of the Chicago Bulls ' training camp in 1984 .
Kevin Loughery , then head coach , remembers the moment like it was yesterday .
`` What happened was we gave him the ball in a drill , one on one , against the whole team , and he immediately started going through guys , killing ' em , '' Loughery recalls .
`` We knew he was a great athlete , but we didn n't know he had all those skills .
We knew we had a terrific prospect , but really , we didn n't know what we had . ''
The Bulls knew this much about Jordan , who would become the league 's scoring champion 10 times : `` He was a better shooter than given credit for , '' Loughery said .
`` He worked all day at it .
But then he started going one on one , scoring all kinds of different ways -- in the post , jumping over people , outside .
I looked at Rod Thorn , and he looked at me , and we knew there was something very special here . ''
As Jordan nears the end of his basketball career , maybe one series away from retirement , Loughery recalls how it all started , how greatness dazzled like a super nova in a dingy gym one October day in 1984 .
Boom : `` That day in camp when we knew we really had a special player . ''
Why did it take that long to understand the wealth of Jordan 's abilities ?
`` He played with Dean ( Smith ) in a passing game ( at North Carolina ) , then with Bobby Knight in the Olympics .
Same style , so we didn n't know he could handle it as well as does .
Once we did the drills , we knew . ''
Rod Thorn , now the NBA 's operations chief , was general manager of the Bulls .
Jordan is the only holdover from his era , the only player who predates incumbent general manager , Jerry Krause .
Loughery recalls that , if he and Thorn had gotten their preference , the Bulls would have taken Hakeem Olajuwon in the 1984 draft , but he went to Houston with the first pick .
Portland already had Clyde Drexler and Jim Paxson , so the Blazers selected Sam Bowie , a center .
`` We knew there were two franchise guys in the draft , and we got one of them , '' Loughery said from his North Atlanta home last week .
`` The thing is , we drafted Michael knowing he was a great athlete , even if we really didn n't know he would be this great . ''
There were others who thought they knew .
Philadelphia had picks No. 5 , 10 and 22 in that draft .
They offered the Bulls the first two ( Charles Barkley and Leon Wood ) plus Andrew Toney for pick No. 3.
The Bulls said no.
`` No matter who was offered , we wouldn n't have taken it , '' Loughery said .
`` We were convinced .
There was no doubt in our minds .
We just felt that strongly about it .
But no matter what you see in talent , you can n't know the total spirit until you have him .
His will to win surpasses everyone we 've ever seen .
That 's what separates guys . ''
Loughery compares Jordan 's will to win with Bill Russell 's .
`` Bill played 13 years , won 11 championships , '' Loughery said `` The other two years he was hurt .
When he walked into locker room it changed .
He took over .
That 's how it was with Michael .
`` He 's really on his teammates , as much a leader as I 've ever seen .
He gets his teammates motivated and pumped up .
In any room , he 's the leader .
He showed that immediately as a rookie .
Before we got out of training camp , he was the man .
You don n't see that .
I don n't care what kind of talent you have , you don n't see that .
`` Dr. J. didn n't have that .
He was a great talent , but he didn n't take over like that .
No one else .
Jerry Sloan ( coach of the Utah Jazz ) had Michael 's drive to win , but he didn n't have his offensive talent .
Some guys could approximate his talent , but they didn n't have his drive to win . ''
Loughery , coach of the Hawks from 1981 - 83 , can appreciate Jordan 's talents at least once more , when he works the NBA Finals for ESPN radio .
`` It 's treat for me , '' he said .
`` A great treat . ''
