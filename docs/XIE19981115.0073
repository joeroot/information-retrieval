Five Nigerian Hospitals Capable for Test Tube
LAGOS , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Five private hospitals in Nigeria have acquired the capability of external fertilization to alleviate the sorrows of infertile women seeking babies through assisted reproduction .
The Guardian newspaper said Sunday that with the acquisition of the in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) capability at the cost of 50 million Naira ( about six million U.S. Dollars ) , scores of Nigerian women with tubal damage could seek babies within the country instead of going abroad .
Professor Giwa Osagie of the Advanced Fertility Center explained that the result of IVF treatment undertaken in Nigeria are comparable with those obtained at the IVF centers in Europe and America with egg recoveries rate of 85 percent and fertilization rate of 75 percent .
But , he added , clinical pregnancy rate of 20 percent and delivery rate of six percent being recorded by Nigerian centers are worse than the 30 percent and 10 percent from Europe , America and Australia .
Osagie blamed this on late attendance at clinics and advanced age of Nigerian women who seek IVF treatment at the age of over 35 .
Growing rate of infertility problem is driving many women to seek IVF service , the paper said , adding that 10 - 14 percent of couples have infertility problem in the west African country .
According to Richard Ajayi , managing director of Bridge Clinic in Lagos , his clinic which started IVF service three months ago has recruited 50 patients for the treatment , but treatment is yet to commence until November 28 when the British experts will arrive in Nigeria .
Nigeria achieved a breakthrough in test tube baby in 1989 at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital , the first of its kind in west and central Africa .
The 1989 breakthrough could not be sustained due to lack of government 's interest in the IVF project .
