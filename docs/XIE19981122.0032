Egypt Voices Concern Over Iraqis ' Plight
KUWAIT CITY , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa expressed concern here Sunday over the plight of the Iraqi people resulting from U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 .
" Our prime concern is the plight of the Iraqi people as it is the concern of everyone , including Kuwait , " Moussa said upon his arrival here to attend the meetings of the Kuwaiti-Egyptian Joint Committee .
Before his departure from Muscat , Oman , the Egyptian foreign minister said his visit to Kuwait is aimed at enhancing relations between Egypt and Kuwait .
Moussa said he will discuss with Kuwaiti officials issues regarding peace and security in the Middle East , adding the Iraqi problem will top their discussions .
The Egyptian foreign minister urged Baghdad to fully comply with the United Nations resolutions and allow U.N. weapons inspectors to conclude their mission in Iraq .
Moussa said it is in the interest of both Iran and Arab countries to maintain positive relations between the two sides .
He called on Iran to solve all problems with its neighbors peacefully , especially the one with the United Arab Emirates over the ownership of three Gulf islands .
Iran took control of the Greater and Lesser Tunbs , in 1971 , and shared sovereignty over Abu Musa with the UAE until 1994 , when it seized full control .
Both Iran and the UAE claim sovereignty over the three small but strategically important islands , which is located at the solo entrance to the Strait of Hormuz , the gateway to the oil-rich Gulf .
