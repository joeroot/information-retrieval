Pierce Moved into Chase Championships Quarterfinals
Pierce dominated the match throughout today with the power of her shot making .
She blasted 18 winners and converted 6-of-9 break-point chances in the 44 minutes .
She will face a tough battle in the next round against world No. 2 Martina Hingis of Switzerland .
Pierce , who won back-to-back titles last month to give her four titles in 1998 , won the opening four games while losing only nine points , giving her rival no chance .
" I just had a good day , " said Pierce , who has won seven of nine matches against the tiny South African .
" All my shots worked for me , basically I just tried to stay concentrated because , against someone like Amanda , if you give her a chance , then she gets back into the match .
Then it can become a very tough match . "
Coetzer committed 15 unforced errors and failed to hold her serve once .
" She started off great and I never even got a chance to get anywhere close to the match , " Coetzer said .
" I didn n't feel like I was playing badly .
I think Martina has got a little more to hurt Mary and she put a little bit more pressure obviously than what I did .
If Mary can continue to serve as well as she did today and if she can keep her composure , I think she is to be hard to beat . "
