Mozambican Customs Harvest Record-High Revenue
MAPUTO , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Mozambique 's customhouse harvested a record-high revenue of 151 billion Metical ( about 12.58 million U.S. Dollars ) in August , 30 percent more than the previous same month .
A news release issued by the National Customs Bureau attributed the increased revenue to improved efficiency by customs offices nationwide .
For instance , over half of the goods which arrived at the Maputo Port could be checked out within 24 hours , with 70 percent being checked out in 48 hours .
The Mozambican customhouse has seen a marginal rise both in income and efficiency after it transferred its management power to a British firm in May last year , said the release .
