SPRINT IN PLAN TO ENTER LOCAL PHONE MARKET
( mk ) By SETH SCHIESEL c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
Sprint Corp. , the No. 3 long-distance telephone carrier , plans to announce Tuesday its long-awaited strategy for competing in local communications markets , executives close to the company said Monday .
The strategy is based on an ambitious plan to deliver high-speed access to cyberspace , the executives said .
Tuesday 's announcement comes after Sprint has spent the last two years essentially sitting on the sidelines in terms of competing in new local telephone markets .
The company seems to have spent that time devising some new tactics for use in the continuing battle between long-distance and local phone companies .
A person close to Sprint said the company was hoping to cooperate with the five Bell local telephone companies rather than attack them head-on .
That cooperation could take the form of Sprint 's agreeing to buy capacity on advanced local data networks that many of the Bells are planning to build .
Bell Atlantic Corp. , which offers phone service for much of the area from Virginia to Maine , and SBC Communications Inc. appear to be the Bells that are negotiating most seriously with Sprint , a person close to Sprint said .
As they await permission from regulators to sell long-distance service within their traditional local telephone regions , Bell Atlantic and SBC each have already signed contracts with Sprint to buy wholesale capacity on Sprint 's national fiber optic network .
Bell Atlantic , Sprint and SBC , which includes Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell and which has agreed to acquire Ameritech Corp. , declined to comment Monday .
In its announcement Tuesday , code-named Operation Fast Break , Sprint intends to unveil what it calls an `` integrated on-demand network . ''
Sprint plans to say that consumers can use a single connection to the new network for multiple phone lines , access to the Internet and other advanced data services and video conferencing .
The company plans to begin offering the new service to large business customers later this year and make it generally available to business clients around the middle of next year .
Sprint plans to begin offering the service to residential consumers in late 1999 .
Sprint plans to offer the service both in areas where the company already offers local phone service as well as in new regions .
People close to Sprint said the company had spent about $ 2 billion the last five years developing the new network .
Among the companies that have tried the new system is Hallmark Cards Inc. , the greeting card giant based in Kansas City , Mo. Sprint is based in Westwood , Kan. , a suburb of Kansas City .
Sprint plans to announce that it has formed three strategic alliances in connection with the new system .
Cisco Systems Inc. , the maker of data networking equipment , will provide high-speed communications equipment that uses an advanced sort of technology known as asynchronous transfer mode .
Bellcore , the former research venture of the regional Bell companies , will provide the main software for the venture .
Bellcore is now a unit of Science Applications International Corp. , a private company based in San Diego that is best known for its work in computer security .
Sprint 's main partner in retail distribution will be Tandy Corp. 's chain of Radio Shack electronics stores .
Sprint already uses Radio Shack to help promote Sprint 's wireless telephone service .

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was meant to unleash broad competitive forces in local and long-distance communications markets .
But while consumers can choose from among hundreds of long-distance carriers , most Americans only have one choice of local phone company : the same provider they had before 1996 .
Many telecommunications experts expected the three largest long-distance companies _ AT&AMP ; T Corp. , MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint _ to invade local phone markets quickly .
But that has not happened .
MCI had an aggressive plan to build local networks and compete against the Bells , but after losses began to mount last year MCI pulled back .
In fact , unexpectedly large losses in its local operation led to perhaps the most traumatic event in MCI 's corporate history : its grudging renegotiation of its deal to be acquired by British Telecommunications PLC last year and an unsolicited $ 37 billion takeover offer from Worldcom Inc. , which was accepted and which is awaiting approval from regulators .
Sprint is expected to say Tuesday that it has already spent most of the money required to build the new network .
That could lead to tough questions about how many residential consumers the company really wants to serve .
