A COMPETITOR REFUSES TO LET GO OF THE GAME
( Subs for rewriting throughout ) ( sw ) By MIKE WISE c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
Larry Bird was wrapping it up , having acquitted himself well under difficult circumstances .
`` The number of offensive rebounds ripped our heart out , '' he said on Sunday night , his voice trailing off .
A fawning reporter finally thanked him for his candor , adding , `` You 've been a breath of fresh air . ''
`` Thanks , '' he said , `` but the referees still stink . ''
A one-liner from Coach Bird .
Emotion at last .
The Bulls began to sweat on Sunday night .
Bird ?
He was the stoic farmer waiting for the wheat to grow tall .
His demeanor in the most stomach-gnawing of times ran somewhere between dispassionate and downright bored .
As the rest of America watched his Indiana Pacers come within 6 points of possibly re-retiring Michael Jordan , Bird walked along the sideline with his hands stuffed in his pockets .
You wanted to shake him , to tell him that these were the Eastern Conference finals , not some after-school pickup game at Springs Valley High .
The moment his team went down hard in Game 7 , he merely walked over to Phil Jackson , shook hands with the Chicago coach and kept going .
`` I remember when I was a player and not shooting well , '' Bird said , referring to Michael Jordan 's resolve .
`` I had to help in other ways . ''
In ways he will never admit , Bird got to play again .
Six years after a debilitating back injury took the game away from him , he ended up on the biggest basketball stage imaginable _ Jordan 's stage .
And Bird 's imperfect team almost pulled it off , the way he almost pulled off his aw-shucks act .
The focus has remained on the world 's greatest player and his potential decline .
Michael this , Michael that .
He is still the most compelling figure in any arena .
Yet rooting for Jordan has become like rooting for Microsoft ; he has a monopoly on winning in the playoffs , killing off everyone else 's product .
That 's compelling ?
So many people in this most provincial of big cities are mourning the eventual loss of the dynasty and the deity .
Yes , Jordan perhaps nearing his last game is a huge story , with all kinds of ramifications .
But Bird finding the competition he craved and had missed was a better one , lost amid the Jordan hysteria .
Bird once said that part of the reason he returned to coach after retiring as a player in 1992 was that his children wanted to know why their daddy didn n't work and everybody else 's daddy did .
People close to him know better .
Bird 's coming back was not about earning a paycheck .
It was about refusing to let go of a game that wouldn n't let go of him .
Great player or 12th man , it is about being as close to the game as you can once you are not able to touch it anymore .
He may have retired six years ago , but Bird picks up a basketball occasionally and squares his body to the rim .
The Pacers assistant Dick Harter said one such occasion happened last fall as the rookie free agents were working at the Indiana Basketball Academy in Indianapolis .
Before he reported for training camp with the Spurs in San Antonio , the veteran shooting guard Chuck Person showed up .
Person 's first-round shootout with Bird in the 1991 playoffs is part of Larry lore .
Person , then with the Pacers , was talking the whole series , making 3-pointers from unimaginable spots on the floor .
Bird responded with a Game 5 masterpiece , coming back from injury during the game to lead the Celtics into the next round .
Person wanted one more crack at the legend last fall .
The two began playing horse , nailing different shots until one of them missed .
Bird won five straight games .
`` Chuck shows up and makes a mistake of getting in a little shooting game with Larry , '' Harter said .
`` Maybe he thought he was out of shape .
Maybe he thought he could take Larry .
Of course , Larry talks and destroys him . ''
Did you know that in his last game at Boston Garden , Bird delivered 16 points , 14 rebounds and 14 assists in a do-or-die playoff victory over Cleveland ?
His heart was still in the sport , but his body could not take the pounding anymore .
In the final five minutes on Sunday night , the Pacers committed four turnovers and made several mental errors under the weight of a stifling Chicago defense .
Mark Jackson could not get an entry pass into the post , turning the ball over to a leaping Ron Harper .
Rik Smits tipped a jump ball he had won against Jordan right into Scottie Pippen 's hands .
Travis Best kept picking up his dribble and running over defenders instead of going by them .
`` Believe it or not , we practice our free throws , '' Bird said , referring to Indiana 's 23-of-37 output from the line .
Asked the difference between losing a game of this magnitude as a player and losing it as a coach , he added : `` Well , it feels about the same , really .
I felt we had a good enough team to win this series .
Coming in here today , I felt like I got them ready to play . ''
Bird barely winced as his team self-destructed and gave away its season on Sunday night , and it seemed oddly appropriate .
He understands : when you don n't suit up anymore , there really is nothing to get worked up about .
