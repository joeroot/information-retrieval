Securities Law Not " Bad " News for Investors : Economist
BEIJING , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese economist Li Yining today reassured investors that China 's first Securities Law is not " bad " news in a time of sagging stock markets .
The draft of the Securities Law , six years in the making , is expected to be approved tomorrow at the on-going sixth meeting of the Ninth National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee .
Sources say that the sharp drop in China 's only two stock exchanges , in Shanghai and Shenzhen , over the past five weeks is a result of the draft which will ban the stock manipulation of state-owned enterprises and the overflow of bank funds into the stock markets .
Li , who is also vice-chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the NPC , noted , however , that the fluctuation of the stock markets is related to the country 's macroeconomic situation .
The Securities Law will surely help maintain a sustainable economic growth , as it absorbs lessons from the Asian financial crisis and takes into consideration China 's actual situation , he said .
He pointed out that the Securities Law will better protect the interests of investors , since it is aimed at cracking down on under-the-counter deals and fraud .
At the same time , the law will help formulate the issue of shares and bonds by enterprises to raise more funds for economic growth , he added .
Li stressed that the Securities Law will greatly benefit the hi-tech industry , an industry ideal for investors because of its great economic returns , along with its high risks .
