Manchurian Tigers to Return to Natural Habitat ( 2 )
by Xinhua writers Gao Shuhua and Wu Xiaojun
The indiscriminate felling of trees , illegal hunting and the animal 's solitary nature , which is not conducive to breeding in large numbers , have resulted in reducing the Manchurian tiger population to around 300 worldwide , according to conservationists .
In 1993 China banned the production of traditional medicines which use tiger bones , in order to help protect Manchurian tigers .
The Heilongjiang base , the largest of its kind in the world , was set up in 1986 , and so far 108 Manchurian tigers have been bred there .
Liu Xichen , an expert on Manchurian tiger breeding and training , told Xinhua today that in 1989 the breeding center started training the tigers for return to the wild .
Beef was replaced by live chickens and rabbits as food for the tigers as the first step in stimulating their hunting instincts .
In 1996 the one-million-sq-m Manchurian Tiger Park was set up in this capital of Heilongjiang , as the largest of its kind in the world .
It is now home to 30 Manchurian tigers .
Liu Dan , a tiger raiser at the park , said most of Manchurian tigers in the park are capable of hunting herbivores and of living in the open in temperatures of 30 degrees Centigrade below zero , which makes them fit for life in the wild .
A 1,000-sq-km mountain area , a traditional haunt for Manchurian tigers where deers and wild boars , which are the tiger 's main food , are increasing in large numbers , has been set aside for the first batch of artificially raised tigers to be released .
Liu Xichen stressed that this is a long-term experiment .
He also called for international aid for the project .
