Iraq Allows Resumption of U.N. Weapons Inspection
BAGHDAD , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraq said on Saturday that it allows an unconditional return of U.N. weapons inspectors , a move that will likely ward off a close U.S. military strike .
Iraq will allow the inspectors of both U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to return and resume their normal missions .
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan read on Iraqi TV , Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz expressed the hope that the resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors will give " a further chance to achieve justice " by lifting sanctions against Iraq .
He said the previous Iraqi decisions to stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors were only aimed at seeking an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.N. sanctions .
Iraq announced two decisions in August and October to partially and totally stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors .
It demands the U.N. consider the lifting of the eight-year-old comprehensive sanctions on it .
Nearly all U.N. weapons inspectors have left Iraq .
Under U.N. resolutions , the sanctions can only be lifted after the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction .
Aziz said the decision to resume cooperation with the U.N. came when many security council members support Iraq 's view over the lifting of the sanctions .
Aziz gave special credit to Russian , Chinese , French and Brazilian diplomacy for the resumption of the cooperation .
Some diplomatic sources here said Saturday that , U.N. chief Kofi Annan , in a letter to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Friday , made a personal assurance of his efforts towards the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq .
Annan also called on Iraq in the letter to resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors before " it is too late . "
Aziz stressed that Iraq has agreed to resume the cooperation not in fear of the " aggressive campaign " by the United States .
The U.S. has threatened a military attack to force an Iraqi backdown and is busy with building up military power in the Gulf .
Washington is sending in B-52 and B-1 bombers along with F-117 stealth jets .
This will bring U.S. forces poised near Iraq to more than 20,000 armymen , 300 aircraft and 20 ships , including two aircraft carriers .
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan responded to the Iraqi promise of cooperation , saying that Iraq 's decision was " positive " and met all requirements of the U.N. Security Council .
The U.S. responded with caution .
" We have not seen the letter .
We 've only seen the reports .
I can n't make a judgment , " White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said .
Top U.S. Security officials are having an urgent meeting at the White House on Saturday to discuss how to respond to Iraq 's promise to resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors .
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen , Presidential National Security Advisor Sandy Berger , Central Intelligence Agency Chief George Tenet and State Department officials met in the White House to review the new development .
The U.N. Security Council will hold consultations on the latest Iraqi letter on arms inspections on Saturday afternoon , U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said .
It is up to the 15-member Security Council to " make a ultimate decision " on the letter , the spokesman told reporters on Saturday morning outside Annan 's residence in New York .
The Council is expected to concentrate on how the world body would react to the Iraqi letter on U.N. weapons inspection , which Annan described as " positive , " saying that he believed it met U.N. requirements in resolving the latest crisis .
Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoon said the U.N. weapons inspectors " They will be allowed in the minute they would like to go and resume their normal work . "
He said one of Iraq 's goals have been met , that is , Baghdad had made it known to the world its views and everyone was now aware of what Iraq wants .
