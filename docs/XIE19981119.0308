Butler Demands Iraq 's Weapons Documents
UNITED NATIONS , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Richard Butler , executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , had asked Iraq to hand over several documents about its weapons programs , a U.N. official said here Wednesday .
Ewen Buchanan , spokesman for UNSCOM in charge of dismantling Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , said Butler had written to Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz Tuesday and asked for several documents .
Buchanan said these secret documents included a logbook discovered by arms experts at an Iraqi air force base earlier this year .
UNSCOM weapons inspectors glanced at it but were not given a copy , the spokesman said .
The weapons inspectors , who withdrew from Iraq last week in anticipation of U.S. air strikes , have returned to their posts Tuesday .
Iraq barred them from most inspections on August 5 ad suspended all its cooperation with them on October 31 .
