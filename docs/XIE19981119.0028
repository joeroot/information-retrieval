Zimbabwean Union Stages National Strike
HARARE , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) Wednesday held another mass job stay-away , demanding the government offer workers a 20 percent wage hike .
The stay-away marked the second attempt within a period of seven days by the labor movement to force the government to immediately resolve " break " issue .
The ZCTU is also demanding the government reverse its decision to implement a hefty fuel price increase which sent prices of basic commodities sky rocketing .
Business was brought to a halt in Harare Wednesday , the country 's capital , as workers heeded the ZCTU call for a national strike .
Industry and commerce in Bulawayo , Zimbabwe 's second largest city , was at a standstill .
The atmosphere in the city 's industrial areas and the city center , resembled a holiday with very few shops open and very few people loitering on rain-socked streets , the Zimbabwe News Agency reported .
In Mutare , the country 's main eastern city , thousands of workers heeded the second call by the ZCTU to stay away from work .
Unlike last Wednesday when the armed forces were caught napping by violent youths who stoned and looted from a service station and a shop , this time armed officers were deployed Tuesday night to avert any possible looting .
Most of workers in other cities and towns also held strike .
Meanwhile , the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce ( ZNCC ) Wednesday called for another tripartite meeting to discuss how the macro-economic stability of the country can be restored .
ZNCC President Nhlanhla Masuku said in a statement that the government , labor and business should make efforts to resolve fundamental problems in economy through the talks .
