NOW IT 'S IRISH-AMERICANS ' TURN TO MOVE FORWARD FOR PEACE
( k and w coding . ) ( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By THOMAS OLIPHANT c.1998 The Boston Globe
WASHINGTON -- The page that has been turned in Ireland now needs to be turned in the United States .
May 's astonishing `` Yes '' votes in the North and South , ratifying April 's miraculous peace agreement and empowering a new majority that can relegate sectarian concepts of the republic and its still-British North to the past , needs to spark a complimentary transformation in this country .
It can n't happen as dramatically , but America 's 44 million citizens of Irish extraction need to organize a critical mass capable of sustaining a future-centered relationship between their country and the new Ireland .
Other Americans have done it well _ Italians , Greeks , Jews and , increasingly , Asians , come to mind .
Now it 's the Irish-Americans ' turn to transcend traditional charity , culture , religion , and knee-jerk republicanism , and mobilize a new generation ready to support a grown-up relationship with a rapidly changing country .
Across the Atlantic , the short-term danger is that the parties to the peace agreement will reconvene in a new Northern Ireland assembly in late summer and gridlock over issues like prisoner release and the turning over of arms and explosives .
The analogy would be with post-Dayton Agreement Bosnia .
Over here , the danger is a loss of momentum .
America 's Irish voice , to pick an absurdly extreme example , must not be that of the ostriches in the organizations that flaunted their surly , quixotic republicanism in full-page newspaper ads urging rejection of the peace agreement .
My metaphor for the future can be found in donated space at a law firm here , where the US-Ireland Alliance is taking shape under the organizing leadership of an amazing bundle of energy and vision _ Trina Vargo , until this month Senator Edward M. Kennedy 's foreign policy staff person and one of the heroes in the back-breaking labors that went on in recent years to make a negotiated settlement possible .
What she is building is an American organization with support from both sides of the ocean that will promote the US side of a new relationship with the republic and the North .
This means vigorous public education , deep involvement in policy issues , and relentless promotion of new coalitions and joint ventures here and there .
It will be tax exempt for individual and corporate donors , but not afraid to use the 20 percent of its resources for lobbying that US law allows tax-exempts .
A model that quickly comes to mind is the frequently powerful American-Israel Public Affairs Committee , with two important differences .
The alliance will not support political candidates , and it is vital that it avoid the kind of identification with the Likud movement in Israel that on occasion diminishes AIPACs impact .
Vargo 's special interest in Ireland is peace , justice , and a new economic future at both ends of the island with much more US participation .
She plans a public television program , dreams of a Rhodes Scholar-like program for American students , and she can n't wait to take on immigration , trade , investment , and other issues .
And , above all , Vargo labors to release the untapped energies of those unorganized 44 million people here , nearly half Protestant , and nearly all inactive in Irish matters .
In part to satisfy Senate ethics rules , her initial fund-raising and organizing has been In Ireland , and it is revealing .
Some of the new powerhouses of the Irish Miracle are on board with six-figure contributions , including the Doyle Hotel Group , the Elan Corp. , the Jefferson Smurfit Group , and Citywest , a major Dublin business park .
And her letterhead will have the names of big shots North and South .
Now Vargo is starting in on the US side .
Of course , her now ex-boss is proudly aboard as is former Coca Cola CEO Don Keough and Mutual of America .
She 'll take a hundred bucks or six figures gratefully .
As a metaphor , the alliance represents an essential shift of the American Irish voice out of Congress .
During the Troubles , a call to the late Tip O ' Neill or to Kennedy might suffice at a critical moment .
No longer , and Kennedy himself has been one of the first to recognize this .
Also as a metaphor , Trina Vargo herself is ideal .
Her grandfather came out of the chaos of Eastern Europe .
She is Irish on her mom 's side ( a Daugherty ) , but the roots go back to 18th century Pennsylvania , and she doesn n't know if they 're North or South , Catholic or Protestant .
She was not into being Irish until she started working for Kennedy .
Now she makes Top 100 Irish-American lists because of her widely recognized role as a player in the peace process .
Most important , while she has a deep respect for the past and the most intimate knowledge of it , Vargo is not obsessed with it .
Her obsession is the future for Irish-Americans and for Ireland .
This concentration on new ideas , new links , new activism is the next page to which a new generation of the 44 million needs to turn .
It promises to be a very exciting time .
