Shanghai Customs Strengthens IPR Protection
SHANGHAI , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Shanghai Customs have increased efforts to eliminate piracy involving intellectual property rights ( IPR ) .
The Customs office investigated over a dozen piracy cases during the first 10 months of this year .
In October alone , related cases involved the illegal use of trademarks or patents for products valued at over two million yuan .
Chinese Customs launched the anti-piracy campaign three years ago as part of an effort to curb the rampant piracy involving both imported and exported commodities .
Local experts point out that Customs offices are required to protect victims filing appeals in accordance with the law .
Experts note that the move to strengthen IPR protection will help maintain order in international trade .
They have also called for strengthening efforts to ensure foreign trade enterprises register IPR items , including trademarks and patents .
