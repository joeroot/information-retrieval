Greece Denies Rift With Cyprus Over Missile Installation
ATHENS , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Greece Sunday denied reports of a rift between Athens and Nicosia over the deployment of the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles that Cyprus has bought from Russia to strengthen the island republic 's defense capacity .
There was no difference of opinion between Greece and Cyprus on the issue of the Russian-made S-300 missiles , Greece 's Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou said in the western Greek port city of Patras .
He said that cooperation between the two governments , which he described as " systematic and close , " was aimed at achieving the best for both sides .
The minister added that what the two countries were doing was for the action needed to achieve an actual reinforcement of Cyprus ' defense and to advance the protracted Cyprus problem .
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides denied Saturday that there was any breach between Greece and Cyprus and said that the joint defense pact between the two countries was sound .
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north and the Greek Cypriots-controlled south in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens .
To strengthen its defense , the Cyprus government decided earlier last year to purchase the Russian-made missiles , but Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the installation of the missiles .
With the nearing of the missile deployment , the tension on the divided island has been increasingly intensified .
Clerides , who visited here later in August , came to Greece Friday for talks with Greek leaders focusing on the installation of the missiles , but he reportedly failed to reach a consensus with Athens regarding the matter .
To avoid being dragged into hostilities with neighboring Turkey , Greece reportedly supports the idea of deploying the missiles in the southern Greek island of Crete instead of Cyprus , but Clerides insists that the missiles will be deployed on the island republic as planned .
