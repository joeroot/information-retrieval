President : Eritrea to Join Arab League at Proper
CAIRO , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Eritrea will join the Arab League when " the time is appropriate , " visiting Eritrean President Issias Afwerki said here on Sunday .
Afwerki made the remark at a press conference after his meeting with Esmat Abdel-Meguid , secretary general of the Cairo-based organization , which has 22 member states in the Middle East and North Africa .
Blaming Addis Ababa for triggering the border disputes between Eritrea and Ethiopia , Afwerki expressed hope that the mediation efforts made by the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) and other parties would lead to a peaceful solution to the issue .
The border between the two countries has not been officially delineated after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 .
Armed clashes took place in May and June between the two sides due to disputes over a number of border areas .
The OAU and some other parties are seeking ways to help resolve the conflict , but no tangible results have been achieved .
Afwerki said that he discussed with Abdel-Meguid a number of other issues related to the Horn of Africa , the Red Sea and the Arab world .
The Eritrean president arrived here Saturday for a two-day visit after attending the 20th Franco-African summit in Paris .
