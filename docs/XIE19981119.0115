Israeli Cabinet Oks First Stage Troop Withdrawal
JERUSALEM , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli cabinet gave its final go-ahead Thursday to the long-delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank agreed upon in the recent land-for-security deal with the Palestinians .
The approval paved the way for Israeli troops to begin withdrawing from 2 percent of the West Bank in the first of the three phases of further redeployment , in which Israel will hand over a total of 13 percent of the areas .
Israeli officials said the withdrawal would begin as early as Thursday night .
Besides turning the 2 percent into shared control , Israel will turn over 7 percent of the West Bank now under joint control to exclusive Palestinian control .
Israel is also expected to open a Palestinian airport in Gaza and release 250 Palestinian prisoners later this week , all agreed on by the two sides in the peace deal .
Seven of the 17 ministers voted for , 5 against and three abstained , local TV announced .
It did not explain whether the remaining two cabinet ministers absented themselves from the voting , following hours of debate in the morning .
Israeli Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan , a leading opponent to the peace accord , said before the cabinet meeting that he was considering leaving the government and would possibly announce resignation after the voting .
The meeting was called in light of a cabinet decision last week when it approved the peace deal .
While ratifying the deal by a narrow majority , the cabinet attached a string of conditions to it , including that the cabinet would convene before every scheduled stage of withdrawal to review the Palestinian compliance with their commitments undertaken in the agreements .
Senior Israeli officials said before the voting that the Palestinians have meet all their obligations during the first stage , including the issue of an decree banning illegal weapons , the confirmation by the Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive Committee of the cancellation of the anti-Israel provisions in the Palestinian national charter .
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat issued a decree to ban anti-Israel incitement earlier Thursday , removing the last hurdle to the approval of the redeployment by the Israeli cabinet .
