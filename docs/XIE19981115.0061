Blair Said Iraqi Crisis Not Over Yet
LONDON , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Sunday that the crisis over the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq is not yet over .
" This is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance is guaranteed and delivered , " he told reporters outside his Downing Street office .
He also warned that Saddam Hussein would in the future be given no notice of plans by the West to launch military attacks .
" There will be no further warning whatsoever , " he said .
Blair confirmed that he had on Saturday authorized the use of British forces against Baghdad before Iraq sent messages to the U.N. Security Council .
The British forces would remain " ready , willing and able " to strike against Baghdad if necessary , he added .
But he welcomed the promises from Baghdad to allow the weapons inspectors to resume their work in Iraq unconditionally .
" All this has to be not just accepted without negotiation or amendment ... More important , it must be acted upon , " he said .
