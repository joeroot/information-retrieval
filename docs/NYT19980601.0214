IN MIDDLE-AGED CIRCLES , VIAGRA INSPIRES HOPE , JOKES _ AND A BLACK MARKET
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By JEFF GUINN c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
FORT WORTH , Texas _ For weeks , my friends and I have been talking about it , usually in hushed tones around back tables in restaurants .
We don n't want others to overhear us pondering the possibilities of Viagra .
Not that we need it , of course .
Still , for men of a certain age _ 40 to 70 is the commonly accepted range _ the concept of a wonder drug that could restore youthful magic to our sex lives is a source of endless fascination and debate .
`` I always thought I was perfectly normal for a man my age , '' says 55-year-old Rich Billings of Arlington .
`` But now I hear about Viagra , and I wonder if maybe I might be missing something . ''
Sixty-four-year-old John `` Zonk '' Lanzillo of Richardson also ponders whether Viagra might be in his future .
`` I don n't need it now , but I 'm wondering if I might not need it next year , '' he says .
`` What the heck does it really do , and where 'd it come from in the first place ? ''
_
Viagra 's genesis at Pfizer Labs is humorous , really .
It was originally tested as a medication for high blood pressure , with little success .
But it had a pleasant side effect , which left the men in the initial test run begging to keep their prescriptions .
`` Our research shows that 52 percent of men between 40 and 70 have some problem with ED , which is short for erectile dysfunction , '' explains a Pfizer sales representative who asked not to be identified .
`` Viagra stimulates blood flow , which allows a stronger erection .
Obviously there is great public interest in this . ''
Fort Worth internist Dr. Kelly Goss first heard about Viagra three months ago , when a urologist friend called him with a tip .
`` ( He ) said to buy Pfizer stock , because Viagra was going to be a home run , '' Goss says .
Now he hears about little else .
Goss and many other Tarrant County practitioners are inundated with visits from middle-aged male patients they haven n't heard from in years .
`` They talk about everything else , and then they finally say , ` Oh , by the way ... '' ' Goss says .
`` They think that if they get Viagra , they 're going to feel like they 're 16 again . ''
But rumors about Viagra 's capabilities , Goss says , are greatly exaggerated .
`` It doesn n't give you erections automatically , '' he says .
`` ` If you get aroused , it helps you keep an erection .
But if you have other problems , psychological problems , it 's not going to help with them . ''
_
The Viagra mythology is already in place .
`` I hear that if you don n't have any problem , if you don n't need Viagra but take it anyway , that you stay ready to go for hours and hours , '' muses 51-year-old Bill Clarkson of Fort Worth .
`` Man , think about it .
Wouldn n't that be great ? ''
And if that `` ready to go '' state extended into the next day ?
`` Well , '' Clarkson says , `` Can you think of a better reason to call the boss and say you can n't come in to work ? ''
Actually , Goss notes , priapism is not one of Viagra 's potential side effects .
For some users , headaches are .
`` This could cause a real turnaround , '' Goss says .
`` Things will change from the wife saying , ` Not tonight , honey , I 've got a headache , ' to the man saying , ` Honey , I 've got my headache , so let 's go . '' '
Billings is more concerned with the fact that the pill doesn n't work instant magic .
`` They say you 're supposed to take it an hour ahead of time .
I mean , if it 's late at night , I 'm not sure I can stay awake a whole hour .
Don n't they have one that works after five minutes ?
And that hour between taking it and using it ?
Doesn n't that assume your wife is going to stay in the mood that long ?
What if you have an argument ? ''

Various newswires have reported Viagra black markets springing up worldwide .
In Tokyo , the football-shaped tablets are said to bring $ 40 a pop .
Americans seem willing to pay $ 20 for pills that cost $ 8 - $ 10 apiece if prescribed by a physician .
`` Hey , I 'd pay $ 20 , '' Clarkson concedes .
The Pfizer sales representative reports that he and his colleagues are regularly approached when they make sales calls on Tarrant County doctors .
Pfizer `` gave us these satchels with ` VIAGRA ' printed on the side , '' he says .
`` We 've had to start carrying them with the other side of the satchel facing out .
Men see that word , ` Viagra , ' and they just want to have some . ''
One Fort Worth urologist heard that Viagra salesmen have even faced impromptu muggings .
Goss reports that Pfizer reps insist on dropping Viagra samples directly on the doctor 's desk .
There 's a rumored Tarrant County black market .
There are whispers that in certain men 's rooms in the hospital district , 50 - and 100-milligram pills can be had by asking the right gentlemen loitering near the urinals .
But a quick check found no one `` holding '' in a hospital toilet .
Then , inspiration struck .
If dealers exist , what could be more prime territory than the Colonial golf tournament for large groups of middle-aged men with readily disposable income ?
Stationing myself by the Porta Potties behind various greens , I sidled up to selected gentlemen in the 40-to-70 age group and hissed , `` Hey , anybody around here got any Viagra ? ''
To a man , they all said they had no idea .
To a man , they all asked me to tell them if I did find somebody with a tablet or two for sale .

Goss says he hasn n't yet heard from irate wives .
But he expects he will .
`` I think there will be married women who 've gotten very comfortable with limited sex lives , '' he says .
`` So if I give Viagra to their husbands , all of a sudden their routines could be radically changed , and they might not be happy about it . ''
The Pfizer salesman believes most wives would be pleased that his company 's product made its way into their husbands ' bloodstreams .
`` I mean , think about it for people who 've been married a long time , like for 25 years , '' he says .
Lanzillo feels inclined to agree .
`` If I ever did take one , I wouldn n't tell my wife , '' he says , chuckling .
`` I 'd want it to be a surprise . ''

It is possible to get Viagra in Tarrant County through the obvious legal means .
Doctors are free to prescribe it .
But that doesn n't mean they will .
`` I 've gotten calls from patients , '' says Dr. Bill Vance , a Fort Worth cardiologist .
`` In many cases they 're on medication , and they want to know if they can take Viagra , too .
Well , you can n't take Viagra if you 're on nitro ( glycerin ) .
Frequently , heart patients on nitroglycerin need to take their nitro after vigorous physical exercise _ one of those classic events is intercourse .
But if they 've taken Viagra beforehand , then afterward if they have chest pain , they can n't take their nitroglycerin . ''
Of course , Vance says , there already are medical jokes about other poor chemical mixes with Viagra .
`` Here 's one , '' he offers .
`` The joke is , you can n't take Viagra if you take iron supplements because of the tremendous danger that , when aroused , you 'll immediately turn to the north . ''
Goss says that a lot more patients ask for Viagra than really need it .
`` I guess , for men a certain age , just having it around offers some security , '' he says .
And Viagra has come along at just the right moment in history .
`` Think about it , '' Clarkson says .
`` Frank Sinatra just died .
Mickey Mantle is dead .
When our heroes die , middle-age men are reminded they 're going to die , too .
Viagra 's a way of holding back the clock a little . ''
_
Eventually , I score Viagra .
One doctor gives me a five-pill sample box and a prescription for five tablets .
Another doctor gives me two boxes of samples , and a casual acquaintance who works near the hospital district passed along a much-handled , grubby blue tablet .
He says it was one of three a male nurse sold him a few days earlier for the negotiated price of $ 12 each .
`` Consider this my birthday and Christmas present to you for the next 10 years , '' he says , and I stash my Viagra in a dresser drawer .
It 's like a friend of mine said when I asked him why he decided to buy a handgun and keep it in his bedroom closet :
`` I don n't expect to ever need it , but it gives me such a warm feeling to know it 's right there if I do . ''
