FOR SOME PARISIANS , THE WORLD CUP IS MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By MIKE GREENBERG c.1998 San Antonio Express-News
PARIS _ The opera-goers were quiet and serious in the subway .
They 'd just exited a riveting production of Alban Berg 's `` Lulu , '' a tragic tale of a hooker with a heart of brass , at the Opera Bastille , and they weren n't exactly humming the tunes .
At Chatelet station , where the commuter line from the new 80,000-seat Stade de France feeds into the subway system , the train was invaded by a horde of young people dressed in the red , white and blue of Paris-Saint-Germain , the city 's pro soccer team .
The pensive silence of the opera-goers was shattered by a lusty chant .
Echoing from one car to the next , billowing in the tiled vaults of the subway stations , it sounded a little like the Tomahawk Chop .
The Paris team had just beaten Lens , 2 - 1 , to win its fifth French Cup .
The team 's supporters were ecstatic .
The opera crowd was oblivious .
Some Parisians care passionately for soccer ; others , perhaps most , don n't .
To judge from the posters for sale in stalls and shops and subway entrances all over Paris , the city 's main passion is neither soccer nor opera , but American film star Leonardo DiCaprio .
`` Chacun a son gout , '' ( to each his own ) as they say .
When the World Cup of Soccer tournament begins June 10 , even soccer-loving Parisians might find it hard to summon enthusiasm : Three days after the French Cup victory , when French national team coach Aime Jacquet named his provisional squad for the World Cup , not one Paris-Saint-Germain player made the cut .
The road to the World Cup has not been altogether smooth .
Complaints that France was hogging too many tickets for its own people rose to the status of an international incident in early spring , when the European Commission and Socialist members of the European Parliament threatened legal action against the tournament 's organizers .
When 40,000 additional tickets were released for international sale , the phone bank was flooded with millions of calls .
Moreover , no arrangements had been made to put the buyers of those new tickets in their proper grandstand areas , somewhat rendering moot the high steel fences that are supposed to segregate the supporters of rival teams .
Acting partly out of a concern about possible violence , the British government has been actively discouraging Britons without World Cup tickets from visiting France during the event .
The French tourism minister last month raised British hackles by sending the opposite message : Come to France to soak up the World Cup atmosphere even if you don n't have tickets .
There 'll be atmosphere and room for everyone , apparently .
French tourism officials are projecting a 5 percent decline in tourism during the World Cup , despite an expected 350,000 World Cup visitors .
As of early May , rooms were still fairly plentiful in Paris ' less swank hotels for all but the opening and closing days of the tournament .
The better hotels tend to be fully booked .
Giant video screens are being set up in public places in all the World Cup cities to provide televised match coverage for the benefit of those who can n't buy tickets .
The screens might be especially appreciated in Saint-Denis , just north of Paris , where the gleaming metal roof of the new Stade de France jammed local television reception .
The city of Paris _ which has a reputation for being gruff to visitors _ has launched several efforts to help World Cup visitors feel comfortable and welcome .
Months prior to the event , an advertising campaign appeared urging service workers such as hairdressers , taxi drivers and waiters to be nice to World Cup visitors .
International soccer matches are always subject to excessive passion and hooliganism , and authorities throughout France are on high alert against terrorism .
World Cup spectators are subject to body searches for weapons and other prohibited items , including alcohol , laser pen lights and `` documents , tracts , insignia , symbols or canvas banners of a political , ideological , philosophical or advertising nature ... ''
The police also have discretion to order drinking establishments to close early .
The French are working with other nations ' police officials to identify and track known troublemakers among soccer fans .
All 10 World Cup stadiums have been equipped with surveillance cameras .
