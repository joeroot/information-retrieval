BIG SPENDERS IN CALIFORNIA RACE MAY GET LITTLE RETURN ON INVESTMENT
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By ROBERT SALLADAY c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
SACRAMENTO , Calif. _ The 1998 primary campaign for California governor has shown more clearly than ever that two things are inevitable in America : excess and television .
These forces came together during the past eight months to produce a political campaign existing almost entirely within a wallpaper of television advertising and fold-out brochures .
Two millionaires opened their wallets and helped make this the most expensive state campaign in history _ $ 55 million and rising .
Even the poorest candidate , Lt. Gov. Gray Davis , neared a record in spending .
As Davis said this week : `` In California politics , if you 're not on TV , you don n't exist . ''
This astonishing display of money and media aloofness came in the middle of a radical change in California politics .
Tuesday 's primary allows all voters to vote for any candidate , regardless of party .
The 1998 primary campaign has left even the most battle-worn political consultants shaking their heads in astonishment .
`` There are going to be books written about this campaign , a few books , '' said Garry South , Davis ' campaign adviser , `` Heck , I may write one . ''
`` This is just an unprecedented race that will be analyzed for years to come , '' said Darry Sragow , an adviser to Al Checchi , the former Northwest Airlines co-chairman who faces fellow Democrats Gray and Rep. Jane Harman in the primary race for governor .
Underneath the veneer of television , the Democratic primary also became a story about three disparate personalities : the career politician , the mother , the corporate take-over artist .
At one time or another , all three made appearances at the top of the polls , and seemed like capable opponents to the certain Republican nominee , Attorney General Dan Lungren .
`` I don n't think we 've seen this many heavy hitters in one race before , '' said Mark Petracca , chairman of the Political Science Department at the University of California at Irvine .
`` We don n't appreciate that enough in this state .
Maybe we would if we were living in Louisiana , where the choice is between who spent the least amount of time in federal prison . ''
Checchi , 49 , is by far the most unusual and contradictory figure in the race .
The multimillionaire grandson of Italian immigrants , Checchi started his campaign poring over dense books on California political history .
He dined with America 's best consultants and pollsters , at the trendy Ca Brea and Ivy in Los Angeles .
But he spent his final days on a hot rented school bus , traveling to El Centro and Watts .
Checchi now blames himself for being stereotyped as the rich candidate , but he was the one who spent more money on a primary than anyone else in the history of state politics _ at least $ 30 million , most on it on dozens of television commercials .
Checchi 's financial portfolio , which grew $ 130 million as the stock market rose during the campaign , paid for a series of malevolent television attacks , mostly against the wealthy Harman .
It was a strategy South calls an act of political `` murder-suicide . ''
Checchi 's biggest problem now is that people overwhelmingly dislike the image he presented on television , but they seem to adore him on the campaign trail where he can meet only a few people at a time .
Checchi hit the road and met more people than any other candidate , but got criticized for living exclusively in the televised ether of political theater .
Even though he lives in a vast mansion , Checchi had the most pessimistic view about California .
He saw the schools crumbling , roads collapsing and jobs leaving .
He had $ 14 billion in plans to fix things , including what seemed like a reasonable request : get the state up to the national average in school spending .
Harman , 52 , is articulate , experienced , tough , telegenic .
She entered the race almost at the spur of the moment , after popular Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat , decided to forgo the race for the governorship .
Harman was hammered for saying she didn n't know the answers to everything , even though she often did .
Her health-care reform ads demanded changes that had already occurred .
She zinged Checchi for his negative ads , but then called him a wheeler-dealer attempting a corporate take-over of California .
At a recent campaign stop , Harman was asked what her legacy should be : `` That she has guts , she wants to heal California , and she made the best possible run in three and a half months . ''
Once described as the `` Energizer bunny '' of California politics , the methodical and phlegmatic Davis seemed like just another political has-been after Harman and Checchi got up to speed .
Davis , 55 , didn n't even air a television commercial until the campaign 's final six weeks .
An Orange County Register columnist seemed to hit the mark when he suggested several months ago , when Davis was behind in the polls , that people look at who Californians have elected governor since Jerry Brown left office in 1983 .
Twice the Democrats nominated popular Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley .
He could have been the first black governor of California .
Then came Feinstein 's nomination in 1990 , with predictions that she would be the first woman governor .
It seemed like time .
Then came Kathleen Brown in 1994 .
For a while she appeared destined for glory , the continuation of a unique family dynasty .
But California voters ultimately picked two sedate and conservative men , Republicans George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson .
Two terms for each .
Wilson 's term ends this year and he can not seek re-election .

The open primary has been called a test run of the November election , since people aren n't restricted to voting within their party .
Could the voters be reacting in the 1998 primary candidates in the same way they did during past four general elections ?
`` People like Gray Davis and Dan Lungren , who have run in several statewide campaigns , are known to the public , '' Deukmejian said .
`` The people feel comfortable with them , and they feel that since the state is in fairly good shape , they don n't need radical change . ''
Dizzy from watching the Checchi-Harman spending binge , few political insiders paid attention to this theory , until a series of polls showed Davis with a 2 - 1 lead over the millionaires .
The Energizer Bunny appears to have turned into the tortoise who , at least according to the polls , may win the race .
`` A year ago , the Checchi campaign was saying they would spend whatever it took to get the job done , '' said Roy Behr , a campaign consultant to Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif . , and former adviser to Harman .
`` I think at that point most people viewed it as a bluff .
It turned out that it wasn n't .
Now , it turns out that all the money in the world may not be enough . ''
