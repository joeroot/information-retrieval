EU Backs Italy in Its Dispute With Turkey Over Ocalan
VIENNA , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The European Union ( EU ) supports Italy in its standoff with Turkey over the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan , the Austrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday .
Austria , in its capacity serving the EU 's rotating presidency , expressed " full solidarity with Italy in her determination to fully implement her laws and treaty obligations , " according to the statement .
Italy has rejected Turkey 's demand to hand over Ocalan , detained in Rome on November 12 on a false passport , on the ground that its constitution forbids extradition to a country where death penalty is in force .
Ankara brands Ocalan as " the world 's bloodiest terrorist , " holding him responsible for more than 30,000 deaths in the 14-year armed campaign led by his Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) for a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey .
The statement issued by the Austrian Foreign Ministry also contained the EU 's condemnation of all forms of terrorism , including the PKK 's " terrorist activities " .
In this context , the EU reiterated the significance of international conventions , the statement said .
