TRADITIONS AND CHARM OF COLOMBIA

NEW YORK _ What would a newcomer to Colombian folk dance have learned from the program presented by the Ballet Nacional de Colombia on Friday night at City Center ?
Not a great deal if that newcomer understood no more than rudimentary Spanish , since the commentary and single-sheet program information were in Spanish .
But this was an event that was clearly aimed at nostalgic displaced Colombians , though the presentation was supported in part by City Center .
And their delight was eventually infectious , as they sang and clapped along , sighed when a favorite dance was announced , and cheered at the frequent mention of their native land .
The program got off to a late and rocky start .
Ballet Nacional , founded in 1971 by Sonia Osorio , the company 's artistic director , choreographer and costume designer , has toured throughout the world .
But a surprising number of onstage and technical mishaps here suggested there had been very little rehearsal time in New York .
By the second half , however , the charming , well-trained dancers were irresistibly in command .
The raucous , lilting music of the live band took off .
And the quality of the choreography , too often of a nightclub glitziness at the start , rose considerably .
The high point of the evening 's 18 dance numbers , which reflected Colombia 's Indian , African and Spanish heritage , was `` La Cumbia , '' a group dance performed in the coastal villages .
Opening with a characteristic gliding trot for the machete-wielding men , `` La Cumbia '' built steadily with lines of candle-bearing women and their men moving slowly back and forward and weaving across the stage in dancing that was both exuberant and restrained .
Another highlight was the finale , `` Mercado Campesino '' ( `` Peasant Market '' ) , a piece that evoked Sunday market days in small towns in the Andes .
The swirling , vividly costumed processional included vendors of fruit , vegetables and bread as well as birds , baskets and utensils .
A make-believe burro carried sacks of Colombian coffee .
An uppity customer accompanied by her scrambling maid wound comically through the proceedings .
