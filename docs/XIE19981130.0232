Israeli Warplanes Blast South Lebanon in
BEIRUT , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli warplanes Sunday blasted suspected positions of Lebanese guerrillas in south Lebanon as a retaliation for the killing of seven Israeli soldiers in recent days .
Two Israeli jets swooped down on a mountainous area between the towns of Toulin and Qabrigha on the edge of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon .
They staged two sorties , dropping two air-to-surface missiles on the area , the Orient radio quoted security officials as saying , but there has been no reports on casualties .
The area is believed to be used by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah , or Party of God , as a base for operations against Israeli soldiers and their militia allies South Lebanon Army .
This is the second straight day for Israeli air raid after its two soldiers were killed by a Hezbollah guerrillas ' roadside bomb inside the Israeli self-declared security zone in south Lebanon set up in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas .
In less than two weeks , a total of seven Israeli soldier have been killed by Hezbollah .
The mounting losses , which have raised to 23 the number of Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year , rekindled heated debates in Israel over its continued presense in south Lebanon .
Several Israeli cabinet ministers on Sunday called for air strikes against Lebanese civilian targets to avenge the killing of Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon .
The ministers made the call before attending a meeting called by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to assess the situation in south Lebanon .
The rising casualties caused growing concern among the Israelis and nearly half of them now prefer a unilateral pullout from south Lebanon , although the idea was opposed by military and intelligence brass .
