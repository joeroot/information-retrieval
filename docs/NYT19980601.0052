DEMOCRATS RENEW PUSH FOR HORMEL NOMINATION
By MARC SANDALOW c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle
WASHINGTON _ Democrats hope to breathe new life this week into the moribund nomination of San Francisco philanthropist James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg , embarking on a strategy that could elevate a low-level diplomatic appointment into a battleground over gay rights .
Sen. Paul Wellstone , a liberal Democrat from Minnesota , is threatening to attach an amendment calling for Hormel 's confirmation to any bill that reaches the Senate floor .
And the White House is looking for an appropriate forum for President Clinton , Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to push for the Senate to act .
The White House recently made a high-profile push for another embattled nominee _ Bill Lann Lee , the administration 's choice as the Department of Justice 's civil rights chief _ and is preparing to do the same with Hormel .
`` The president , the vice president , and the secretary of state continue to take every opportunity to push the leadership of the Senate , '' said Clinton aide Richard Socarides .
`` They will start to do that more publicly when the Senate comes back '' from its recess this week .
Hormel is the nation 's first openly gay nominee for an ambassadorship , a post that requires Senate confirmation .
Although he appears to have the support of a majority of senators , a handful of Republicans have voiced objections to Hormel 's long-standing support for gay causes and used a procedural maneuver to prevent the full Senate from voting .
The clash could quickly grow into a high-profile showdown over gay rights , reminiscent of former San Francisco Supervisor Roberta Achtenberg 's fight to win confirmation for a high-ranking post at the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
`` Given the fact that I have not heard one good reason why he is not qualified , I have to be very concerned that it is because of blatant discrimination , '' Wellstone said Friday in an interview .
`` I think what is happening is shameful .
Wellstone said that once the Senate finishes its work on the tobacco bill , he will introduce a series of amendments in the hopes of forcing a vote on Hormel .
A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , R-Miss . , who has refused to schedule a vote , offered a cool response .
`` If Sen. Wellstone wants to hold up appropriations bills that provide for keeping the federal government open .
...
that 's certainly his business , '' said Lott spokeswoman Susan Irby .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination 16 to 2 last fall .
But opponents , encouraged in part by representatives of the religious right , quickly emerged .
Citing a variety of reasons _ Hormel 's generous financial contributions to gay causes , his establishment of a gay and lesbian learning center at the San Francisco library that bears his name , and his refusal to denounce the Catholic-mocking `` Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence '' _ Hormel 's adversaries said his confirmation would be an affront to the people of Luxembourg , who are 95 percent Catholic .
In a speech on the Senate floor last month , Sen. James Inhofe , R-Okla . , one of at least four senators blocking the nomination , read from a Chronicle article in which a gay leader called Hormel 's appointment a `` reward to gays and lesbians for their support '' of Clinton 's candidacy .
`` I will continue to oppose the confirmation of individuals who are nominated for various positions if I believe , in my own heart , that that individual is not going to represent the best interests of America and has his own personal agenda in advance of Americans , '' said Inhofe .
Hormel , heir to a meat-packing company fortune and a major contributor to the Democratic Party , has the support of at least 44 Democrats and 14 Republicans _ easily enough to win confirmation _ according to aides to Sen. Dianne Feinstein .
Feinstein recently presented with a letter signed by 41 of her colleagues calling for a vote and has discussed the matter with him at least four times .
