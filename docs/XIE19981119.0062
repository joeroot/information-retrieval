House Republicans Selects Speaker , Other Leaders
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives nominated Bob Livingston Wednesday to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker and gave Dick Armey another two years as majority leader .
Meanwhile , Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma , the only black Republican in the House , was elected chairman of the party conference .
Watts , a former football player , defeated Representative John Boehner of Ohio for the conference chairmanship , the fourth-ranking leadership slot .
The vote was 121 - 93 .
Armey , a Texan who has been majority leader since the Republicans gained control of the House in the 1994 elections , defeated Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma on a third ballot .
The vote was 127 - 95 .
Watt 's election was a victory for the party 's conservative wing .
Boehner had served as conference chairman the past four years .
Representative Bob Ney of Ohio , a Boehner supporter , said the former chairman " got blamed in my opinion for the lack of an agenda here .
They were looking for a magical message that didn n't exist . "
" People were ready for a change , " said Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona .
Challenging Armey were Largent , Dunn , and J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois , who dropped out after finishing fourth on the first ballot
After the vote for majority leader , Armey emerged from the closed caucus with Largent and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington and called the contest " a well-run race of energy and enthusiasm . "
" I will continue to fight for the things we believe in as a party , " said Largent .
Dunn appealed for unity , saying it was important to " sweep up the residue " from the leadership contest .
Tom DeLay of Texas had no opposition for another term as party whip , the third-ranking leadership post .
Livingston , who chaired the House Appropriations Committee , was chosen by voice vote in a closed-door meeting of the 223 House Republicans who will serve in the 106th Congress .
With the backing of the majority party , he is assured election to the job when the new House convenes January 6.
The leadership elections followed two weeks of intense behind-the-scenes campaigning by candidates for the jobs , and in some cases months of preparation .
Livingston said House Republicans will not betray their philosophy , but " lose nothing by reaching out to the other side , to talk and listen and work in tandem with those who may share some of our goals and dreams . "
The 55-year-old Livingston will succeed Gingrich , who on November 6 announced that he would retire from his post and from Congress .
Clinging to his job as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee was Representative John Linder of Georgia , who had been handpicked by Gingrich .
His challenger was another moderate , Representative Tom Davis of Virginia .
