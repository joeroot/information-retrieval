Weizman Urges Syria to Negotiate With Israel
JERUSALEM , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman called on Syria Sunday to resume negotiations with Israel over Israel 's pullout from south Lebanon .
" The key is in Syria 's hands and Syria could restart its negotiations with Israel to solve this issue in the spirit of the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference , " Weizman said .
Weizman made this call during his visits to the families of the Israeli soldiers killed Thursday in the occupied zone in south Lebanon , the Israel Radio reported .
Despite all the difficulties for an immediate solution , the two sides should try to meet with each other because this issue could only be solved peacefully through negotiations , he said .
Two Israeli soldiers were killed Thursday in south Lebanon , bringing the death toll to seven in ten days .
A total of 22 Israeli soliders and one Israeli civilian have been killed so far this year in the area .
The rising death toll brought about increased urge by the Israeli public for ending Israel 's occupation in south Lebanon .
Israel set up the self-styled security zone there in 1985 after two invasions , with the declared aim to protect its northern border from guerrilla attacks .
A war of attrition has since been engaged between Lebanese resistance guerrillas and Israeli occupation forces and their proxy South Lebanon Army militia .
A poll in the Israeli newspaper Maariv on Friday indicated that 40 percent of the Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal , compared to only 16 percent in February 1997 .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his European trip Friday to return home to work out Israel 's strategy on South Lebanon .
After inspecting the security zone Sunday morning , Netanyahu called his security cabinet ministers and military leaders in the afternoon to assess the situation in south Lebanon .
Israel has offered to withdraw from south Lebanon , but conditioned it on Lebanese government 's guarantee of its security .
The offer was rejected by Lebanon , and its close ally Syria , who demanded Israel pull out unconditionally as asked by the U.N. Security Council .
Syria is a major power broker in Lebanon .
Israeli has accused Damascus of using south Lebanon as a bargaining chip to force Israel to return the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Mideast War .
Peace negotiations between Syria and Israeli broke up in early 1996 and Syria insisted that a resumption should be from where they were left off - Israel should honor the oral promise made by the previous Labor government to eventually return the Golan .
Netanyahu 's left-wing Likud government rejected the demand .
