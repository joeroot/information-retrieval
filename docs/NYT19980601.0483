WASHINGTON : the region .
Guerrillas
Rebels and Traffickers in a ` Coca Republic '
Administration officials say there is no sure way to keep the anti-drug battle from running into the guerrillas , given what has taken place over the last couple of years .
In response to an aggressive government campaign against coca cultivation and transportation in neighboring Peru , the officials say , the traffickers have joined some major rebel fronts to create a virtual coca republic .
Peasants who support the insurgents are planting more coca , FARC units are protecting more drug crops and labs , and government authority has eroded across the region .
Military officials including Wilhelm , the commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command , said drug profits and other income are financing the guerrillas ' purchase of more and perhaps more sophisticated communications equipment and weaponry .
Intelligence officials said there was now some guerrilla activity in perhaps 700 of the country 's 1,071 municipalities .
And they estimate the insurgents ' strength at as many as 18,000 combatants _ 10,000 or 11,000 in the FARC , 7,000 in the National Liberation Army _ up from as few as 8,000 fighters six years ago .
`` The threat is intensifying , '' Wilhelm said in an interview .
`` We are seeing , basically , an undermining of governance at the grass-roots level .
In a sense , I see a nation divided . ''
More vivid than the CIA 's estimates of rising coca cultivation , however , have been U.S. intelligence reports on the decrepitude of the Colombian army .
In March , a force of 400 to 600 FARC guerrillas crushed an army unit near the southern village of Billar , killing 67 soldiers and capturing about 30 more , according to Pentagon figures .
Officials said it was probably the most serious defeat of government forces since the guerrillas took up arms in the mid-1960s , but only one of a series of battles they have lost in the last 18 months .
And military analysts said the Colombian army was probably weaker than it looked .
As many as half of its 121,000 soldiers are deployed to protect cities , oil pipelines and other fixed targets .
A classified Defense Intelligence Agency assessment first reported by The Washington Post speculated that if current trends continued unchanged , the armed forces could be defeated within five years .
Congressional Republicans cast the situation in even direr terms .
`` The frightening possibilities of a narco-state just three hours by plane from Miami can no longer be dismissed , '' Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York , chairman of the House International Relations Committee , said at a recent hearing .
Prodded insistently by Gilman and a small group of other powerful Republican lawmakers , the administration recently announced what the acting State Department anti-narcotics chief , Rand Beers , called `` an ambitious new strategy to attack narcotics trafficking in Colombia on all fronts . ''
Beers , who helped draft the Andean strategy 10 years ago , said the State Department would start by adding at least $ 21 million to its anti-drug aid program to Colombia this year .
In part , the money is to finance an expanded campaign to eradicate drug crops and destroy laboratories in the southern Colombian departments of Putumayo and Caqueta .
Because the rebels have such a strong presence in the region , officials say , those efforts will require greater army help .
But while U.S. officials have often announced such collaboration in the past , it has consistently foundered on the rivalry that has long existed between the two services .
U.S. officials have already begun to work with the Colombian air force to intercept drug flights , and will provide night-vision equipment for its planes .
Colombian military officials have also said they would like to buy armored attack MH-1 Cobra helicopters , and a Defense Department official predicted that the Pentagon would support such a request .
Wilhelm , the Southern Command chief , insisted that the United States was not sending the sort of advisers that it once stationed with military units in countries like El Salvador and Vietnam .
But he also made it plain that he himself has become a crucial adviser to the Colombian high command .
After the Colombian military commander , Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett , presented his own strategy plan in January , Wilhelm and his aides began picking it apart , highlighting a number of problems .
Wilhelm has since worked with Colombian commanders on a sweeping overhaul of the armed forces , and ordered a `` comprehensive '' review of U.S. training .
Additionally , a small group of Southern Command analysts have embarked on a side-by-side comparison of Colombia 's experience with that of Peru , where leftist guerrillas protected coca growers for years .
With the waiver of Colombia 's decertification penalties this spring , administration officials said their basic question was not whether they would increase aid to Colombian forces , but how and by how much .
