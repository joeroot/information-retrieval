Consumer prices grew at a menacing pace of 24 percent in Delhi while the average price rise in the country 's 59 urban centers was recorded at 14.5 percent in October .
According to the latest update on Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) for urban non-manual employees , the average inflation rate in the 59 select urban centers all across the country dropped marginally from 16.1 percent in September to 14.5 percent in October .
