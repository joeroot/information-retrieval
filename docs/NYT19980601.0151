SPIDER MITES CAN BE A HUGE PROBLEM
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By KATHY HUBER c.1998 Houston Chronicle
Q : I bought four roses in February _ two antique roses and two miniatures _ all of which I grow in containers .
All are blooming off and on , but powdery mildew and spider mites are decimating the leaves and flowers .
I 've put fungicides and insecticides on these plants , and nothing fazes these pests .
Leaves that escaped these pests are turning yellow .
I fertilize regularly with rose food .
I water at 6 p.m. as I don n't have time to water before work , but take care not to wet the foliage .
A : Thanks to the mild winter and this long stretch of hot , dry weather , spider mites are a huge problem .
These pests are not insects but members of the spider family .
Since you only have four containerized plants , wage war with the water hose .
This tactic will require diligence , but I think you can put a dent in the life cycles of these pests with persistence .
Fight the mites with a high-pressure spray from the water hose .
Hit the undersides of the leaves at least every other day .
You also could dust the leaves with sulfur to help control the mites .
Damaged leaves will not green up .
You 'll have to wait until new ones grow for a healthier look .
Insecticides are not always an effective means of control of spider mites .
Do the products you 've used target them ?
Look for a miticide .
Avid , a product used by many rosarians , is expensive , but only a small amount is used per gallon of water .
You could possibly share the expense with another rose gardener .
Others report success fighting mites with products that contain neem .
Although leaves that have diseases such as black spot will eventually yellow and drop , yellow leaves are not always caused by disease or insects .
Foliage that has served its purpose will yellow and drop .
Too much or too little water will cause leaves to yellow .
Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that does not thrive with moisture , and a good washing weekly can help control the disease .
You could even cut off the affected tips .
This disease blemishes plants , but does not kill them .
Powdery mildew , too , usually becomes less of a problem as summer wears on .
Antique roses will get the same disease as modern roses but are usually so vigorous they drop diseased foliage and continue to grow .
Although ` Martha Gonzales ' is said to be one of the more disease-tolerant varieties , no rose is totally resistant .
And , of course , gardeners ' experiences differ .
Abundant sunshine , good air circulation and healthy soil are the first steps toward good resistance .
Container-grown roses need a nutrient-holding soil mixture .
Organic matter is beneficial , and fish emulsion is helpful in boosting soil health .
Keep your containers ( or gardens ) free of fallen diseased leaves .
Many gardeners discourage blackspot and mildews by spraying a fungicide every seven to 10 days .
While I tend to shy away from printing product names , the following have gotten good reviews from various gardeners .
Funginex is popular .
Safer 's manufactures a sulfur-based fungicide that helps control powdery mildew and blackspot .
Rose Defense , which contains neem oil , fights mites as well as powdery mildew .
If you wish to go organic , spray plants with a baking soda / water mixture at a rate of 1 to 2 tablespoons per gallon of water .
Apply with a hose-end sprayer .
Q : My ripening tomatoes have white spots .
What causes these ?
Some have had blossom end rot , too .
What can I do to prevent this ?
A : If your tomatoes have white or yellow spots or patches just beneath the skin , they may have a condition called cloudy spot .
If you peel the fruit and find white corky tissue beneath the chlorotic surface blemishes , you have cloudy spot , which is actually stink bug damage .
Keep the tomato garden weed-free , as stink bugs hide in weeds .
Pesticides that target stink bugs include pyrethrin and sabadilla .
Sunscald causes white , papery spots on the side of the tomato that faces the sun .
The fruit often has yellow-orange blotches near the stem end .
These areas do not ripen .
To avoid this problem , keep plants as healthy as possible to avoid diseases that trigger leaf loss .
You want plenty of foliage to shade the fruit .
Blossom end rot is a physiological disorder caused by a calcium deficiency and aggravated by water stress .
The blossom end of the tomato develops a sunken , dark brown or black lesion .
To avoid , water carefully and mulch .
You can apply a liquid fertilizer that contains calcium nitrate .
Add lime or calcium to your soil mix before planting your tomatoes next season .
Note : Keep the soil evenly moist to discourage blossom drop .
Q : I have a television cable box in my garden that serves myself as well as many of my neighbors .
It is about 3.5 feet tall by 18 inches .
I would like to camouflage it but must ensure the cable company technicians can access it when necessary .
I think a potted fern in front of the box would be nice .
I already have some decorative rocks in my garden , and I would like to plant the fern in a container that looks like a natural rock .
Do you know if anyone makes a pot that is shaped like and has the color of natural rock and also is several inches deep ?
A : There are accent boulder planters on the market .
These are lightweight volcanic boulders in irregular shapes .
If you can n't find such a product locally , Gardener 's Supply , 128 Intervale Road , Burlington , Vt. , 05401 carries them .
A simulated stone trough may also serve the purpose .
These are occasionally available at local garden shops .
They are also available through the catalog of the Kinsman Co. , River Road , P.O .
Box 357 , Point Pleasant , Pa. , 18950 - 0357 .
I think this type of container would blend nicely with rocks .
You also might consider growing a short climber in a large , attractive , terra-cotta container with a rose pillar ( black steel trellis ) or bamboo trellis .
These are available at some local garden centers and also through Kinsman .
Or you could group attractive terra-cotta containers in front of the box .
A short screen of pickets or bamboo would dress up the area .
You could use potted plants in front of the screen or not .
