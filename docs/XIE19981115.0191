Bulgarian Strongmen On Top Again after Nine-year Break
SOFIA , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Bulgarian weightlifting team ranked first at the World Championships in Lahti after a break of nine years .
Ivan Abadjiev who stepped down in 1989 and a futile period followed , resumed the position in mid 1997 to justify his reputation as one of the most eminent representatives of the sport .
Till December of the year , Abadjiev had trained a team to rank second in the world , with three of his disciples winning gold medals .
This year was even more successful for the Bulgarian weightlifters by winning eight of all 15 titles at the European events and finishing first at the World Championships in Lahti .
Zlatko Vanev , who suffered a severe injury at the European championship , recovered to win a gold medal to become the only athlete repeating his success of last year 's world events .
Plamen Zhelyazkov also became world champion by setting a world record in the snatch event .
Both Peter Tanev and Izabela Rifatova bagged home the silvers while Ivan Ivanov and Neli Yankova got their bronze medals .
" I am pleased with the team 's performance but they have bigger potentials , " coach Ivan Abadjiev said .
Two weeks before the World Championship , all Bulgarian weightlifters competed in France and Germany which hindered their preparation for the Lahti World Championship , the coach said , adding he did not blame the athletes because they are underpaid in Bulgaria .
" However , things can not go on like this , " he stated , " If adequate incentives are not provided for the athletes I can not guarantee their good performance at the world meets and the Olympic Games . "
Bulgaria has the potential to compete in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney with athletes of all categories , said Abadjiev .
He praised the women for their performance as Izabela Rifatova , Neli Yankova and Siika Stoeva did not won gold medals but set up a string of European records to rank just behind the Asian athletes .
The optimistic statement of Abadjiev , a traditional pessimist , gives hopes for the future performance of the Bulgarian weightlifters .
Bulgarian athletes regained their position in the world elite and proved that the success they scored ten years ago was not accidental .
