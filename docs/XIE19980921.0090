China Building Forest In Tibet
LHASA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- China has added more than 1.5 million trees to 3,300 hectares of barren land in 38 Tibetan counties since 1995 .
Forests in the Tibet Autonomous Region now contain fruit trees and trees producing edible oils , beverages , essences and raw industrial and medicinal materials .
The trees have helped economic development in the autonomous region , and fruit trees , the Chinese prickly ash , and tung oil trees have become a major source of income .
Zogang County in the eastern part of Tibet has put 120,000 yuan ( about 14,000 U.S. dollars ) into the business over the past three years .
Some farmers have planted their own orchards .
Each household can earn 4,000 to 6,000 yuan annually by selling fruit .
Statistics from the Tibet Forestry Administration show that the economic trees in Tibet produced an output value of more than 50 million yuan last year .
Officials say that the trees also add beauty to the landscape of Tibet , and have provided a protective screen for villages and farmland .
