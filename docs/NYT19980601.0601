UPSET NOMO CUT LOOSE BY DODGERS

The Los Angeles Dodgers Monday abruptly ended their relationship with Hideo Nomo , the Japanese right-hander who helped revitalize interest in major-league baseball in 1995 with his corkscrew delivery , but this year had pitched terribly , grew disenchanted and requested a trade .
The New York Mets expressed interest in obtaining Nomo , while the New York Yankees said they might also be interested in the 29-year-old right-hander , who was designated for assignment and removed from Los Angeles ' 40-man roster .
Nomo , who was 2 - 7 with a 5.05 earned run average this season , was perturbed that the Dodgers had included him in trade discussions with Seattle about Randy Johnson and asked to be relocated .
`` We 'll be talking to many teams , perhaps all teams , '' Fred Claire , the Dodgers ' general manager , said .
`` There is a time frame .
That being said , there is also a great demand for pitching . ''
The Mets , who have the lowest ERA in the major leagues , could be very involved in pursuing Nomo , who must be traded or assigned in 10 days or could be placed on unconditional waiver release in seven days .
Nomo is in the last year of a contract that pays him $ 2.8 million this year .
This is the second major move by the Fox Group , which bought the Dodgers from the O ' Malley 's two months ago and traded Mike Piazza as part of a seven-player deal last month .
This decision almost certainly reduces Nomo 's trade value because teams know Los Angeles has a deadline by which to move him .
After having his four-year major league career take a drastic turn , Nomo might feel cozy with the Mets because Bobby Valentine managed in Japan , pitcher Masato Yoshii is his best friend , Mike Piazza is his former catcher and Dave Wallace , a senior adviser for the Mets , was Nomo 's coach with the Dodgers .
`` It 's something , in general terms , that you might consider internally , '' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips , who broached Nomo 's name during a discussion about other pitchers with a reporter before Monday night 's game against the Pirates .
Brian Cashman , the general manager of the Yankees , was flabbergasted by the Dodgers ' decision and promised to monitor it .
`` The Dodgers designated him for assignment ? ''
he said .
`` Wow !
That 's very interesting .
I don n't know what else to say other than that 's surprising .
I 'm certainly going to look into it like anything else . ''
Nomo barely spoke during a news conference in Los Angeles , saying he `` definitely needed a change of scenery , a change of environment . ''
After the devastating work stoppage in 1994 canceled the World Series , Nomo helped baseball regain attention by arriving from Japan with a 95-mile-an-hour fastball and a wicked split-finger pitch , both emanating from a seldom-seen corkscrew delivery .
He was 13 - 6 with a 2.54 ERA and 236 strikeouts in 1911 / 3 innings in 1995 and was named the National League 's rookie of the year .
Nomo 's success was followed so fervently in Japan that thousands watched him pitch on mammoth screens in Tokyo in early morning hours .
He became one of the most popular players on the Dodgers and struck out 500 batters faster than any other pitcher , 4442 / 3 innings .
Nomo was 16 - 11 with a 3.19 ERA in 1996 and 14 - 12 with a 4.25 ERA last year .
He had allowed 18 earned runs in his last 262 / 3 innings and had dropped his last four decisions , causing some fans to boo him at Dodger Stadium .
`` I would like to think trades are inevitable in this business , '' Yoshii said .
`` Even Mike Piazza was traded .
He 's a friend .
It would be nice .
But it 's not my decision . ''
Piazza considered the prospect of the Mets ' getting Nomo and said : `` That would be weird .
Can you imagine more of a zoo ? ''
