Annan Says Iraq 's Decision to cooperate unconditional
UNITED NATIONS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday confirmed that Iraq 's decision to resume full and complete cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors was unconditional and the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) could resume its normal work .
Speaking to press , Annan said Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz had assured that their decision was unconditional and UNSCOM could resume its normal work , including inspections and monitoring .
Aziz also indicated that the attached list was for the consideration of the United Nations and there were no conditions , Annan said .
The U.N. chief said the Security Council would meet this afternoon to discuss this issue so the indications were good , Annan said .
" Last night we went to bed not knowing what we 'd wake up to but this seems to be a positive development and the Council will act this afternoon , " Annan added .
Annan 's confirmation is widely seen here as a move to dispel any misunderstanding of a attached list to a letter written by Iraq and delivered to U.N. chief Annan this morning .
In the letter , Iraq told the U.N. chief that It had decided to resume full and complete cooperation with the United Nations .
Iraq stated in the attached list its views on the comprehensive review which the Security Council promised to conduct once Iraq resumes cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors .
Iraq reiterated that the list was to be without conditions .
Iraq on October 31 announced to suspend all its ties with UNSCOM , prompting the looming military strikes against it by the United States , which has massed heavy forces in the Gulf .
With the shuttle diplomatic efforts by the international community , Iraq on Saturday decided to resume cooperation with the United Nations .
The Council is scheduled to meet late this afternoon to discuss Iraq 's response .
U.N. chief Annan said he would present the meeting .
