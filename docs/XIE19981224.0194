Albania Rules out Granting Asylum to Ocalan
TIRANA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Albania Wednesday denied it was considering granting political asylum to Abdullah Ocalan , the Kurdish rebel leader being held in Italy despite an extradition request from Turkey .
" The Albanian government has not talked and has no intention of talking with anyone about an issue which has nothing to do with it , " a Foreign Ministry spokesman said .
Italy and Turkey have been wrangling over the future of Ocalan who was detained on international warrant in Rome on November 12 .
Turkey wants Ocalan on treason charges for leading a 14-year armed struggle for an independent Kurdish state in southeast Turkey but Italy has rejected the extradition demand because Italian law forbids extradition in cases where the defendant could face the death penalty .
Several news reports have speculated on the possible deportation of Ocalan to Albania , a country to which both Italy and Turkey have no objection .
The Albanian Foreign Ministry affirmed that Tirana would not grant asylum to Ocalan if Italy and Turkey have chosen another country to solve their own diplomatic crisis .
