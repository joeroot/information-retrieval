South Korea Postpones Tour Program to DPRK
SEOUL , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The program of taking South Koreans to tour Mountain Kumgang in the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , originally scheduled to start this Friday , has been postponed .
Upon returning here Monday from a visit to the DPRK , Chung Mong-hun , chairman of the Hyundai Group , said the launch of a Hyundai cruise ship to the DPRK was delayed as a final agreement was not reached on the details of the tourism project , including investment matters .
" As a result , the maiden voyage of the cruise ship is likely to be made mid-October at the earliest , " said Chung .
The DPRK 's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee , in charge of the tourism project , is still engaged in negotiations with other DPRK authorities on the details of the project and the delay does not have connection with the matter on tour expenses or political problems , he added .
Due to the delay , Hyundai will also postpone sending workers and construction material to the DPRK for the construction of pier facilities in Changjon Port , the gateway to Mountain Kumgang .
Hyundai signed an agreement with the DPRK 's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee in June this year to develop tourism resources of Mountain Kumgang by bringing 1,000 South Koreans every day for sightseeing in the mountain area beginning from September 25 this year .
