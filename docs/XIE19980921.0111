Philippine Airlines Readies Sale of Assets
MANILA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) submitted Monday to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) a " liquidation plan , " outlining the mechanics of its closure within a two-month period .
Jaime Bautista , PAL senior vice president for finance , told reporters that the management began formulating a two-month liquidation plan last week .
He said the priority of the plan would be the return of some 25 aircraft under mortgage .
Although PAL announced last week it will end its flight operations after midnight on Wednesday , it has yet to withdraw its debt relief petition .
Thus , it has to meet the SEC-set deadline of Monday to submit its liquidation plan .
Monday 's hearing was set as a venue of PAL 's interim rehabilitation receiver to submit to the rehabilitation plan .
The hearing was set long before PAL announced its closure .
Under SEC rules , PAL is required to withdraw its debt relief petition and file a motion for liquidation or dissolution if that is what it plans to do .
If PAL wants a voluntary dissolution , it will have to seek the approval of the majority of its board as well as its stockholders , representing two-thirds of the company 's authorized capital stock .
A motion filed by PAL this June with the SEC for the suspension of its debt payment also stands in the way of any foreclosure .
PAL owes foreign and local creditors at least 2.1 billion U.S. dollars .
The biggest foreign creditor is Chase Manhattan Bank which syndicated the loan for the early phase of PAL 's refleeting program .
Chase 's local exposure to PAL is about 230 million dollars , of which about 180 million dollars is thought to be unsecured .
PAL 's biggest local creditor is the Philippine National Bank , a minority shareholder of PAL , with an exposure of 75 million dollars .
Aside from owing local and foreign banks , PAL owes money to many of its trade suppliers as well as oil companies , hotel operators and others .
Before its retrenchment in June this year , the airline had a fleet of 54 aircraft , flying to 36 domestic destinations and 28 foreign cities .
