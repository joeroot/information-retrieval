Tourists Invited to See Titanic at Sea
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- A British travel company on Thursday invited adventurers to pay thousands of dollars to view the real Tinatic ship which lay in the North Atlantic deep sea for the past 86 years .
At a news conference , travel company Wildwings is offering week-long expeditions to the wreck site about 588 kilometers south east of Newfoundland , Canada , from August for 50 people at 33,000 dollars each .
" For people who are non-scientists and not part of a film company , it will be the first time for them to do this , " said Mike McDowell , co-owner of Deep Oceans Expeditions , which will operate the trip .
He said people interested in the expedition would dive to the ocean depths of 6,000 meters in two Finnish MIR mini-submarines that were used in the Hollywood hit movie " Titanic " .
" The wreck itself is 12,600 feet deep .
When we make the dive , we will be within feet of the actual wreck .
It 'll be the same sort of scenes you 've seen in the movie , " McDowell said .
The luxurious Titanic was said to be unsinkable .
But on its maiden voyage in April 1912 , it struck an iceberg and went to the bottom .
