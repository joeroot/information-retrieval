LAWYER FOR MEGGETT SAYS SEX ASSAULT CHARGE IS DROPPED
( a and s coding ) ( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY c.1998 The Boston Globe
Sexual assault charges against former New England Patriots player David Meggett have been dropped , but the running back still faces robbery charges stemming from a February incident in a Toronto hotel room .
Meggett , who the Patriots released last month , had been charged with attacking a 33-year-old woman when she refused to continue having sex with him after the condom he was using broke .
An angry Meggett then allegedly reclaimed from her coat pocket a roll of $ 20 bills he had given her in exchange for sex .
Sexual assault charges also have been dropped against Steve Brannon , a former Patriots practice squad player and an acquaintance of the unidentified woman , who was in the hotel room with Meggett .
Meggett 's lawyer Alan Gold Monday said prosecutor James Atkinson of the Crown Attorney 's Office in Toronto moved to dismiss the charges Friday in the Provincial Court .
Gold said he persuaded prosecutors in Toronto that there was insufficient evidence to justify the sexual assault complaint .
`` Let 's leave it at that , '' he said .
Meggett , who was not in court on Friday , faced up to 10 years on the sexual assault charge .
Gold said he and the prosecutor are due back in court on July 20 to set a trial date on the theft with violence charge .
Meggett could be sentenced to 20 years in prison , if convicted .
If Meggett wishes , Gold said he will push for a trial prior to the start of the next National Football League season .
Meggett is unsigned by any NFL team , although the New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars have expressed some interest in the 31-year-old veteran player .
Patriots spokesman Don Lowry said that despite the finding , there are no plans to bring Meggett back to the team .
At the time of his release , Meggett had three years remaining on his contract for $ 1 million a year .
`` The release was final , '' Lowry said .
Other than Gold , none of the parties involved in the case could be reached for comment .
In an interview shortly after the incident , the 33-year-old Toronto woman said she had met Meggett for the first time on Feb. 27 in his room at the Royal York Hotel , a luxury hotel in downtown Toroto .
That night , the woman said , she and Brannon first had protected intercourse , using a condom she had with her .
Later , while the two were engaged in sexual intercourse again , Meggett entered the suite and placed a roll of money on the table and participated .
Eventually , Meggett 's condom broke , and she told him not to continue unprotected .
`` I am thinking I can get pregnant , '' she said .
`` I finally pushed him ( Meggett ) off , '' she said , `` and I saw there was no condom there .
`` They were all trying to justify it by saying because they were in the league , you know , the football league , and they get tested ( for disease ) .
Later , she said , Meggett became angry and slapped her four times .
He took back the roll of money , she said , saying she didn n't deserve it .
She left the suite at the Royal York Hotel and was sobbing against a wall when a group of guests approached her and phoned police , according to investigators .
Meggett and Brannon were arrested at the hotel later that morning .
Meggett has been free on $ 7,500 bail and Brannon on $ 2 , 500 .
