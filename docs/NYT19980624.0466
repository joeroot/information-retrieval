PARCELLS SIGNS TESTAVERDE , DUMPS O ' DONNELL ( JT )
By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
CLIFTON , N.J .
_ Bill Parcells , claiming he has learned from great sports franchises to be aggressive , officially dumped quarterback Neil O ' Donnell Wednesday and signed Vinny Testaverde , but gave Glenn Foley the `` benefit of the doubt '' as the Jets ' starter .
Thus six months of an involved financial struggle between the Jets and O ' Donnell , and a personal struggle between O ' Donnell and Parcells , ended with the onetime Super Bowl quarterback looking for a job .
Both sides voiced their disappointment over their brief alliance .
O ' Donnell started a mere 20 games over two seasons as the centerpiece of an aggressive splurge for free agents in 1996 , before the Parcells era began .
He earned almost $ 12 million for those appearances , including a $ 7 million signing bonus .
Because his contract was not guaranteed , he will not earn any more from his highly publicized $ 25 million , five-year package .
In fact , he will have to return the $ 3.75 million he received earlier this year as an advance on his 1998 pay ; he did pick up about $ 50,000 in interest , though , according to his agent .
For Testaverde , the Long Islander whose childhood bedroom was papered with Jets photographs , and who won a Heisman Trophy at Miami in 1986 , `` this was a dream come true . ''
`` I 'm confident I 'll be the starter , '' said Testaverde , 34 , who has thrown 175 touchdowns against 183 interceptions while amassing almost 30,000 yards in his 11-year pro career .
He signed a one-year deal for $ 1.5 million , and the Jets have an option for a second year for $ 4 million .
Still , Parcells said Testaverde is not the starter .
At least not yet .
The $ 1.5 million a year is backup quarterback money .
If he does become the starter and meets a list of incentives , he can swell his salary to as much as $ 5 million .
Only two years ago he was in the Pro Bowl , but the Baltimore Ravens , his third pro team , cut him three weeks ago .
O ' Donnell was to earn $ 4.2 million this year , a sum Parcells was unwilling to pay and which O ' Donnell was unwilling to slice .
Finally , Parcells said , he decided to make a move .
As his model , he said he used pro-active franchises such as the Cowboys and the Packers .
O ' Donnell said : `` I was looking forward to showing everyone I could be the starter .
It just ended a little quicker than I wanted . ''
He claimed he put the negotiations in the hands of his agent , Leigh Steinberg .
But Steinberg has suggested it was O ' Donnell who did not want to take a pay cut .
The Jets went 9 - 7 last season , mostly behind O ' Donnell , a remarkable turnaround from 1 - 15 in 1996 .
But O ' Donnell was yanked in consecutive games in midseason and the Jets won behind Foley , who had the knack of putting the team in the end zone .
Foley became the starter , but lasted only two games before a knee injury ended his season .
The Jets scored one touchdown for every four drives led by Foley _ twice as often as they scored for O ' Donnell .
Still , Parcells has expressed concern for Foley 's staying power .
So who is the Jets ' starter ?
`` I told Vinny that right now , Glenn gets the benefit of the doubt , '' Parcells said .
But Parcells , speaking at the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic , in which the three quarterbacks competed , added that he told Testaverde that `` if he performs at a level that 's obviously better , then he 'll be the starter . ''
Foley , a former Boston College star , does not have a complete-game victory in the NFL : he has won games coming in as a backup , and he has won games as a starter that he did not finish .
But Foley is much larger now in his upper body , having put on 15 pounds and weighing 225 .
He is not surprised , he said , that Parcells has given him `` the benefit of the doubt . ''
`` See how the vote of confidence has many faces , '' Foley said after learning what Parcells had said .
Foley was in a jovial mood Wednesday , shooting a three-over par 75 .
O ' Donnell came in 12 over while Testaverde was 11 over .
Foley claimed that neither O ' Donnell 's up-in-the-air status nor Testaverde 's signing bothered him .
`` With all the stuff going on the last year , I 've been steeled , '' Foley said .
`` It really doesn n't affect me either way . ''
What has affected him , he claimed , was the fact that he was the main quarterback through a winter and spring of conditioning at the Jets ' training complex .
`` The off-season camp did wonders , '' he said .
`` It was nice being in charge and running the offense .
It was my show . ''
On the course , the three quarterbacks , who were in different pairings , were mobbed after finishing each hole .
After putting out at one of them , Foley told a group of youngsters : `` Let 's go over here so we don n't get hit by any balls .
O ' Donnell 's behind me . ''
O ' Donnell heard words of encouragement from fans , including one who said , `` Good luck wherever you play next year . ''
Away from the ropes that restrained the crowds , Al Testaverde was happy for his son .
But he didn n't want to get too close to the action .
`` I don n't go to the games , on advice of my doctor , '' he said .
`` I 've got a bad heart .
I get too excited .
I 'm very selfish .
I wish he would retire so I could sleep better . ''
Vinny Testaverde sleeps fine , and he doesn n't even worry about money any more .
He turned down $ 1 million more from Cincinnati for the opportunity to play for the Jets , who he claims could make it to the Super Bowl .
The main attraction to New York , he said , wasn n't coming home as much as finding what he described as `` a Super Bowl contender . ''
