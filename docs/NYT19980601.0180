TMS PAVES WAY TOWARD REDEMPTION
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By SIMON GONZALEZ c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
FORT WORTH , Texas _ There 's a new word before the Texas in Texas Motor Speedway .
Reconfigured .
Or Revamped .
Or , it 's hoped , Improved .
`` It 's a completely different racetrack , '' said Eddie Gossage , executive vice president and general manager of the track .
The 1.5-mile trioval has undergone an estimated $ 2 million to $ 3 million overhaul just in time for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series ' Pronto Auto Parts 400-kilometer race Friday night and the Pep Boys Indy Racing League 's True Value 500 K event Saturday night .
There 's a new drainage system , pipes and sump pumps in place , designed to let rainwater flow under the track and prevent the seepage problems that plagued the 24-degree banking in turns 1 and 4 during the NASCAR Winston Cup Texas 500 in April .
The transitions into Turn 1 and out of Turn 4 have been altered by raising the outside walls in those areas and adding as much as 45 inches of pavement against the concrete .
The infamous eight-degree `` dual-banking '' has been removed and the entire track repaved with a tighter asphalt mix .
The changes were made in response to complaints by Winston Cup drivers , and to allow the side-by-side racing that stock-car fans love .
The first driver to turn laps on the reconfigured track _ albeit in a Chevrolet Monte Carlo pace car _ approved .
`` It 's a better racetrack , '' IRL driver Greg Ray of Plano said .
`` Oh yeah .
It 's a better racetrack . ''
The best thing , the ideal thing , the perfect-world thing would have been to get it right the first time .
The best thing would have been for the best drivers in the world to come in and proclaim it the best racetrack in the world .
But there 's an old saying about the best laid plans .
TMS could not lay claim to the title as the world 's greatest racetrack when it opened for business in April 1997 .
The facilities and the amenities were excellent .
But there was one not-so-slight problem .
The racing surface .
`` This place is first-class .
Nothing like this has been built anywhere else in the world , '' Gossage said .
`` Those kinds of things got lost by the fact that the mile-and-a-half ribbon of asphalt wasn n't right . ''
The NASCAR Winston Cup drivers hated it when they came to town for the inaugural race last year .
The transitions into and out of the corners were difficult , they said .
The banking fell off too quickly in the exit to Turn 4 , and didn n't begin soon enough entering Turn 1.
They couldn n't race side by side .
It got worse this year .
The track leaked .
There 's another old saying .
Something about what to do when you don n't succeed the first time .
Gossage and track owner Bruton Smith swallowed a little pride , ate a little crow , burned the remainder of those `` Shut Up And Race '' T-shirts and tried again .
`` Nobody _ drivers , sanctioning body , fans _ wants this to be perfect more than we do , '' Gossage said .
How well TMS officials succeeded in their quest for perfection won n't fully be determined until next year , when the Cup drivers return .
The IRL 's open-wheel cars are lighter and generate more downforce than Winston Cup cars , and they didn n't have any problems with the track .
The IRL put on the best show of the four races run at TMS in ' 97 .
So the IRL race won n't be the true test .
Neither will the truck race .
The trucks are basically Cup chassis with pickup bodywork , but they get into the corners about 15 mph slower .
`` Nobody has seemed to have had the trouble that the Winston Cup cars have , '' Gossage said .
`` What we want to hear and see is what Winston Cup drivers have to say .
Let 's face it : That 's our marquee series and event .
I want to hear what Rusty Wallace and Dale Earnhardt and Mark Martin and those guys have to say . ''
The Winston Cup drivers won n't be back until next year .
But when they do return , Ray suggested that they will say all the right things .
`` The banking stays until they 're done turning , so it will give them more control , '' he said .
`` All that banking will push them down and give them grip .
`` For NASCAR , hopefully it 's enough of a change that they can just worry about racing and set up their cars and not complain about the racetrack . ''
The preliminary feedback indicates that the complaints should at least lessen , if not disappear .
The drainage system seemed to pass its first test when the track received more than an inch of rain Tuesday night .
`` If we had practice starting at 8 o ' clock ( Wednesday ) , we could have had it dry with the jet dryers and pulling tires behind wreckers , the normal stuff you do , '' Gossage said .
`` We would have had a perfectly wonderful day of racing .
We feel like we 've resolved that issue . ''
As for the racing surface , that issue appears to be resolved also .
`` It 's just smoother and has more banking into and out of the corners , '' Ray said .
`` Ultimately , it 's just going to be easier to race and faster . ''
It might even allow for side-by-side racing .
`` That 's obviously the goal , '' Gossage said .
`` That 's what we were shooting for .
Hopefully , the width and transitions will give them the ability to race two-wide .
`` We 're going to a variety of things to expand the grooves here .
For instance , put up pylons when we have the racing schools run here and make them run the higher groove .
The Winston Cup guys are naturally going to the top groove .
If we 've already got some rubber worked into the top groove , it 's going to give them reason to search around and find a place that works better for them . ''
The only change that absolutely had to be made was to the drainage system .
NASCAR president Bill France Jr. threatened to take away the truck race if the seepage problem wasn n't fixed .
France also hinted broadly that TMS had no chance for a second Cup date , and that even the first date could be in jeopardy , if changes weren n't made .
Although a drainage system would have corrected the water problem , it would have done nothing to repair the track 's image .
`` We felt the proper thing to do was not only fix the water but fix everything , '' Gossage said , `` and try to do the best we could and really send a statement to NASCAR , to the competitors and the fans that we really want to have the very best speedway we can have for all of them .
We wanted to go that extra mile . ''
Which brings to mind another old saying for the new and improved racetrack : Better late than never .
