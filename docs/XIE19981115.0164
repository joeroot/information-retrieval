Action Urged to Protect Leasing Sector
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Legislation is urgently needed to guarantee the healthy development of leasing businesses in China , according to today 's China Daily ( Business Weekly ) .
The leasing sector has boomed over the past few years , covering housing , household electronic appliances and computers , automobiles , aircraft , and machinery and equipment .
However , a number of problems have arisen , said the paper .
Some leasing companies use fake and shoddy products , and some lease holders defraud rental firms by taking advantage of their opaque and backward management and supervision systems .
Other drawbacks include rental companies ' failure to check the credit records of customers , defaults on rental fees , violation of contracts , and loss and damage to the items hired .
An incoherent government administrative system has also hampered the growth of the industry .
China 's first law pertaining to leasing contracts are still under discussion at meetings of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , which is expected to come up with a result by the end of this year .
