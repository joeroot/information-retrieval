ONE CRITIC 'S DOGGED PURSUIT OF GEORGE
( EDS : Accompanies GEORGE STRAIT-ESSAY ) ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By SHIRLEY JINKINS c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
George Strait is elusive .
Really elusive .
In fact , George Strait is so elusive , his press agent , Kay West in Nashville , is essentially an answering machine .
Since 1982 , I 've left approximately 55 messages for Kay / George in pursuit of interviews or information and received approximately five return calls .
Nonetheless , nearly two decades of my life have been spent in journalistic pursuit of this Sinatra of South Texas .
To date , the sum total of my efforts has been one ( 1 ) phone interview , in 1984 , and one ( 1 ) in-person interview , in 1992 .
And that 's actually a pretty good record for a Strait newshound ; other longtime country music writers have NEVER scored an interview with him .
The phone interview in 1984 was a 15-minute conversation done from George 's ranch in South Texas , as he and the Ace in the Hole Band were literally loading up to go on tour .
He told me that , no offense intended , he didn n't much like doing interviews , and he refused to use his free time to do them .
He was tallying that interview into his road time , he said , as though he 'd punched a time clock .
Later that year , I attended the Country Music Association awards , when George won Male Vocalist honors for the first time .
It was his first major award .
How 'd he feel ?
asked the press .
Pretty good , said George .
By 1992 , when he filmed his movie `` Pure Country '' in and around Fort Worth , George was legendary .
I watched the filming of the concert sequence at Tarrant County Convention Center Arena , and was invited by the movie company publicist to do a `` one-on-one '' with George the following week .
I went to an abandoned dance hall in Midlothian on the appointed day and watched George walk up a dusty road in the early morning .
Then I watched George film a sequence inside the dance hall and was surprised at how natural he seemed .
The other actors goofed lines and faced the wrong way , but George didn n't .
He occasionally made suggestions and was minded when he did .
I finally got my chance in late afternoon , after waiting around all day .
George went on his tour bus with wife Norma , and I was invited to join them for 15 minutes , although we talked for more than 45 minutes undisturbed .
The press agent cautioned me not to bring up personal matters .
I promised I wouldn n't , and I didn n't .
I found Norma to be outgoing and likeable , and George seemed to appreciate how I made genuine friends with their dog , a Boston terrier .
George lounged in his seat , spoke in a languid , low drawl , and cross-examined me with a flash of his green eyes on several occasions .
He was mildly confrontational if he thought I was drawing the wrong conclusion .
He stuck pretty much to business _ his music , the movie _ though he did touch on rodeoing and his dog .
The only sign that there was tension to the interview was George 's constant toying with a piece of rope , tying slipknots .
He 'd study the knot intensely for a few moments before answering sometimes .
Then , suddenly , he 'd flash that silvery smile , and I 'd feel relief wash over me like the Frio River .
I covered the world premiere of `` Pure Country '' in the fall of ' 92 , in San Antonio , and was invited to a sumptuous party afterward .
George made the rounds , without an entourage , and blended in with the crowd .
I couldn n't bring myself to be pushy to this quiet , pleasant man during such a lovely party .
His manager eventually introduced us .
I said something really clever , like `` Nice to see you again ; I liked your movie , '' and he said something memorable like `` Well , thanks .
It 's good to see you again , too . ''
( He did , however , add that little sideways half-smile , and I noticed that his eyes looked blue in candlelight . )
So , why don n't I , and other spurned journalists , just write George off and curse him as a prima donna jerk ?
Because I honestly believe that he isn n't .
He 's uncomfortable telling strangers personal details , and I believe he considers it unseemly .
George Strait does nothing for its press value , and in an age when Naomi Judd jabbers publicly about whether daughter Ashley wore underwear to a certain awards show , George remains a personal mystery .
Besides , maybe , just maybe , he 's saving all his secrets to divulge to me and me alone someday .
Kay might give me a call back to set it up , any day now .
