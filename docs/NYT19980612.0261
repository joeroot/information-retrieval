ASIAN CRISIS CONTINUES TO RATTLE STOCKS
( ja ) By DAVID BARBOZA c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ The stock market continued to cascade Friday , falling sharply for the fourth consecutive session on renewed concerns about Asia 's economic woes , before a rally late in the day pushed prices higher .
Heightened fears about another round of economic and financial turmoil in Asia has roiled stock markets around the world this week , but Friday investors finished off a bad spell by buying back into the market in the last hour of trading .
The Dow Jones industrial average , which had fallen as much as 128 points early in the day , ended up 23.17 points higher , closing at 8 , 834.94 .
For the week , though , the Dow lost 202.77 points , or 2.2 percent .
The Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500-stock index , a broader measure , rose 4.26 , to 1 , 098.84 .
But the Nasdaq composite index , which is packed with technology issues , fell for the third session , down 4.70 , to 1 , 745.05 .
Bond prices , meanwhile , dipped a day after a sharp rise pushed long-term interest rates to their lowest level in about 30 years .
Friday , the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , rose to 5.66 percent from 5.65 percent a day earlier .
Although the economy appears remarkably sound , with hefty growth and low inflation , Wall Street analysts said the recent global selloff was once again raising the specter of troubles ahead .
Even while Friday 's market eked out a gain , the trend has been unnervingly bearish .
`` The market 's going through this classic Asia crisis meltdown drill , '' said Stephen Roach , the chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter .
`` There 's a fear that Japan and Asia are out of control . ''
Since mid-April , stock prices have been choppy and largely depressed , unable to gain much ground after a sharp run-up early in the year .
Slowing growth in profits and a widespread belief that share prices have grown too expensive are said to be contributing to the weakness .
But as Roach said , now , much like last October , there are reverberations from Asia .
The problem is that economies throughout Asia and the Pacific region are floundering , creating fears that the economic crisis could eventually disrupt the U.S. economy , which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Wednesday was as `` impressive '' as any economy he had seen in his nearly 50 years of close observation .
The crisis in Asia is particularly acute in Japan , which has been sputtering for much of the decade .
Friday , more bad news came when the government said the Japanese economy contracted at a 5.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter , confirming reports that the economy has fallen into a recession .
That downturn has drastically weakened the Japanese yen against the dollar , and economists fear a sliding yen might cause other Asian currencies to plunge , creating a ripple effect that could reduce demand for American products in Asia and cut into corporate earnings , which are already weakening .

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
Energy and technology stocks have been particularly hard hit in recent months .
Oil stocks have fallen sharply with oil prices , and technology issues have slid because of falling earnings estimates partly because of Asia 's impact on the industry .
Indeed , in early trading Friday , the Nasdaq fell a full 10 percent below its all-time high of 1 , 917.61 , a drop that constituted a benchmark `` correction '' in Wall Street parlance .
But analysts said heavy computerized buying programs in the last hour of trading lifted blue-chip issues and even some technology shares .
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks , which have long trailed the bigger issues , also fell Friday , dropping 10 percent below its all-time high and leaving the index virtually flat on the year .
Gail Dudack , the chief investment officer at UBS Securities , said that the continuing crisis in Asia simply exacerbates fears about slowing profit growth in the United States .
`` Wages are growing so much faster than pricing , '' she said .
`` The big risk is that profits are plateauing .
What Asia means is that top-line growth will be hurt ; we won n't be able to sell them anything , and they 'll compete with our products on price . ''
But Roach said fears that the yen 's weakness would force China to devalue _ setting off a broader competitive round of devaluations _ was overblown .
China and Japan do not compete directly in the export market , he said , and the Chinese economy remains strong and will probably be able to withstand the yen 's turbulence .
`` A lot of people are reacting as if Japan is unexpectedly imploding , '' he said .
`` Japan has long abdicated its role as a leader of Asia and an engine of global growth .
And even if the Asian crisis continues , I think the global economy will be OK . ''
