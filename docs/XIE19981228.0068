Cambodian PM : Priority Is to Maintain Lasting Peace
PHNOM PENH , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said Monday that the most urgent task for the royal government now is to maintain the lasting peace in the country , asking foreign countries to stop interfering .
Speaking at the Council of Ministers , Hun Sen stressed that he does not agree to try Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea , the two remaining top Khmer Rouge leaders who defected to the royal government last Friday .
" It is the best way to solve the problem in our own way .
The foreign interventions should be ended .
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea returned to the society only as ordinary people .
So I believe the Khmer Rouge can not stage a comeback , " said Hun Sen.
" It is a great event in Cambodia that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea defected to the Cambodian society .
It is our great victory and will play a positive role to the peace and development of our country , " added Hun Sen.
" We should bury old grudges and be oriented toward the 21st century .
Their defection to the Cambodian society means the total demise of Khmer Rouge 's political and military system which lasted decades , " he pointed out .
At the same time , he confirmed that " Khieu Samphan , Nuon Chea and their families will come to Phnom Penh on Tuesday and will be warmly welcomed with flowers and not handcuffs and prison . "
Some foreign countries , human rights groups and opposition party Sam Rainsy Party ( SRP ) asked to detain and prosecute the nominal leader of Khmer Rouge , Khieu Samphan , and top ideologue Nuon Chea when they arrive in the capital Phnom Penh .
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea defected to the royal government in Pailin Friday evening and pledged to recognize Cambodia 's Constitution and the royal government led by Prime Minister Hun Sen. They also asked to be allowed to live as common people .
The defection left Khmer Rouge 's one-legged general Ta Mok still holding out in the jungles with perhaps 100 loyalists .
