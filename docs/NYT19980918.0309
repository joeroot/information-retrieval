If investors think it may be time to test the stock market again , they may be overlooking one issue : seasonality .
September , it seems , in the last half-century or so , has been the single worst month for the stock market .
According to The Wall Street Companion , a New York-based market newsletter , the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen in 30 of the 47 Septembers since 1950 , by an average of roughly 1 percent .
Moreover , according to Matt Stichnoth , the newsletter 's editor , market performance was especially poor in those Septembers that followed nasty Augusts .
In seven years since 1950 , the market fell in August by 4 percent or more .
In five of those cases the market fell again in September , with the average drop 5.9 percent .
( Last month the market fell 14.5 percent . )
Stichnoth cited psychological reasons for the month 's poor performance .
September , being the last month of the third quarter , is `` that awful time of year when expectations for corporate earnings have to be marked to reality once and for all , '' he said .
It is often the month in which analysts throw in the towel after hoping for a second-half rally .
Ground Floor , a newsletter based in Old Tappan , N.J . , reports another factoid .
This September falls during a midterm election year ; in each of the past nine midterm Septembers , the market has fallen .

Week 's Stock and Bond Issues Fall to a Low for the Year
It 's tough trying to unload securities in these whipsawed times .
Even so , last week was especially dismal for new issues .
Securities Data Co. , a Newark research firm , reported that debt and equity issuance for the week fell to a spectacular low for the year , with just over $ 14 billion of new securities sold , based on preliminary totals .
That is in contrast to $ 16 billion the previous week , and a high of $ 56.5 billion during the week beginning March 15 .
For Yahoo , the Growth Mantra Goes On and On and On
Investors searching for signs of life in the stock market , and in the technology sector in particular , need look no further than their Internet search engine .
While thousands of stocks are trading at 25 percent or more below their recent highs , shares of Yahoo , which closed at $ 90.4375 on Friday , are up 430 percent from this year 's low and off just 12.8 percent from their high on July 7.
There is more good news .
On Thursday , at a conference sponsored by Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco , Yahoo 's management told portfolio managers that the company 's operating profit margin was likely to increase by more than one-third by this time next year .
That means that the 16 percent to 26 percent operating margins that Yahoo said it expected when it went public in mid-1996 should increase to a range of 30 percent to 36 percent .
On Wednesday , Yahoo delivered the same message to a conference sponsored by Donaldson , Lufkin & AMP ; Jenrette in New York .
That day , Yahoo shares jumped nine points .

Funds Watch : A Study Finds Problems In Converting Closed-End Funds
Investors who hope to make a tidy bundle if their closed-end fund converts to open-end status may be in for a rude awakening , according to a new study by CDA / Weisenberger , a fund tracking service in Rockville , Md. The study , which looked at 10 closed-end funds that became open in 1997 and 1998 , concludes that long-term investors in converted funds suffered , and for several reasons .
First , such funds were forced to sell to meet redemptions , the study reported , thus realizing capital gains that resulted in bigger tax liabilities for investors .
Fund assets fell by an average of 28.2 percent within six months of the conversion , the study said .
Because of the shrinking asset base , the average expense ratio rose to 1.89 percent for the open-end funds from 1.33 percent for the closed-end versions .
Because managers of open-end funds need more cash on hand to meet redemptions , the amount held in converting funds ' portfolios rose sharply .
On average , cash positions rose to 7.8 percent of assets after the conversions , from 2.4 percent .
And managers may be pressured into adopting a more risk-adverse investing style to avoid redemptions .
