Chinese People Shaking Off Restrictions on Free Movement ( 1 )
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) - China 's old systematic social order is fading away to be replaced with a new policy which suits the general public interest , leading sociologist Li Peilin has said .
" The positive change affecting the social structure has further strengthened the direction of social policy , " added Li , a research fellow of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ' Institute of Sociology .
" The old , somewhat ailing system is now in conflict with new efficiency led strategic objectives , " he said .
China has used the unit system , differential household registration system and administrative rank system since the 1950s , established to give priority to the deployment of defense and heavy industry .
" But China is undergoing economic institutional transition and social structural transformation , " the senior expert said .
Although these two changes seem to be part of the same process , with China 's overall reform in the past two decades and its economic reform program being the direct cause of the accelerated transformation of the social structure , ultimately the latter involves a more lasting and fundamental change compared to the more transitory economic changes which are affected by market forces , Li said .
Under the old planned economy , the Chinese government mobilized all resources in order to catch up with other countries in terms of the defense and heavy industries .
It obtained the information it needed to formulate social policy through strict organizational channels .
Therefore , the state placed every individual under organizational administration and extended such methods of administration , supervision and control into every corner of society .
This meant that the Chinese people used to be extremely dependent on their work units .
A person 's identity , social position , treatment and prestige were closely related to the attributes of the unit he belonged to .
