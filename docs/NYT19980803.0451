COX GOES OUTSIDE TO START JETS CAREER , BUT NOT YET AS TARTING LINEBACKER ( JT )

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ For the seven previous years , Bryan Cox has been one of the National Football League 's outstanding linebackers , mostly in the middle .
Monday , he began his career with the Jets , not as their new starting middle linebacker , but as a backup on the outside .
This unexpected , and perhaps temporary , turn of events unfolded during the Jets ' morning practice here at their Hofstra University complex .
When the first defense took the field for a nine-on-seven drill , Dwayne Gordon was in the middle , James Farrior on the weakside and Mo Lewis on the strongside .
When the second defense took over , Pepper Johnson was in the middle , Chad Cascadden on the weakside and Cox , wearing his familiar neck collar , on the strongside .
That means that with the start of the season five weeks away , Cox , a 30-year-old four-time Pro Bowl player , is the backup to Lewis , who is perhaps the Jets ' best defensive player .
That was not the role many people envisioned when the Jets signed Cox to a one-year , $ 500,000 contract on Saturday , a day after their starting middle linebacker , Marvin Jones , tore two ligaments in his left knee and was lost for the season .
Coach Bill Parcells said he planned to keep Cox on the outside .
`` He wants a chance to be a starter , '' Parcells said .
`` I told him I 'll go by what I see .
I said I would expand his role , and I think he could play in the middle in substitute formations , '' which means nickel and dime defenses .
Parcells said that at this stage of Cox 's career , outside linebacker might be better for him .
`` He would go one-on-one with the tight end , '' Parcells said , `` and I think he can certainly compete with tight ends well .
I think the coverages are simpler here .
That allows him to be a rusher from the outside , and he does that well . ''
Cox , 6 feet 4 inches and 250 pounds , was the best available free-agent linebacker .
He has played seven often-tumultuous years as a pro , the first five with the Miami Dolphins and the last two with the Chicago Bears .
His wild temper has led to penalties , fines and angry coaches and teammates .
After the 1995 season , when Don Shula retired as the Dolphins ' coach and Jimmy Johnson replaced him , Cox left the Dolphins as a free agent and signed a four-year contract with the Bears .
After two years , they terminated the contract , disappointed that he was not getting more sacks and upset over his outbursts .
So Cox was available and the Jets needed a middle linebacker .
They have Pepper Johnson , an old favorite of Parcells ' , but Johnson is 34 and recovering from quadriceps surgery .
They also have Gordon , a sixth-year career backup .
With 11 television cameras recording every moment , Cox said he was happy with his new role .
`` Playing in the middle hides a little of my weakness , '' he said , `` because I 'm not the greatest cover guy .
I 'm giving away something in coverage , but when you ask running blocks to block me , you 're playing to one of my strengths .
`` I always said if I wouldn n't be a starter , I would quit .
But I 'm going to play a lot of plays here .
Logistically , I 'm not going to be a starter , but I 'm going to have a lot of plays .
Instead of 1,300 plays a year , I 'll have 600 or 700 . ''
In his first practice as a Jet , Cox wiped out Richie Anderson for a loss on a running play .
`` He 's not giving me anything , '' Cox said of Parcells .
`` I 'm like a young player .
I 'm going to play special teams and I 've got to earn everything I get .
I still think I 'm a quality linebacker .
When I get in shape , there are going to be some plays for me . ''
Without a team to work out with in the off season , it may take Cox weeks to get in game shape .
Cox said he had been playing softball and golf daily , but not working out .
He said he hadn n't run in two and a half weeks .
But Parcells said Cox was the top linebacker on his list of emergency replacements , and now that he is here , the coach has options .
When Parcells was asked who would start at middle linebacker , he was vague .
`` I 'm not sure , '' he said .
`` I would say now it 's Dwayne Gordon .
I 'm not counting Pepper out .
I think we can play with the guys we 've got . ''
And that includes Bryan Cox , wherever he plays .
