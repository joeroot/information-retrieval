Scientists Stress Development of Aquiculture ( 2 )
Oceans , which cover as high as 71 percent of the earth 's surface , are filled with abundant organism resources , a major source of protein for human beings .
However , Zeng warned that natural conditions place limits on aquatic resources and stressed that people should actively develop marine breeding and cultivation to supplement agriculture .
China leads the world with annual aquatic output of over seven million tons .
The nation 's output of artificially-bred sea fish stands at 200,000 tons , with the output for freshwater fish exceeding nine million million tons .
Zeng said China can score a major breakthrough by breeding sea fish and developing blue agriculture .
He also pointed out that China has vast potential to increase its output of shellfish and marine plants .
He suggested that governments at various levels and collectives should expand efforts to develop aquiculture in bays , with the exception of bays used as commercial ports .
Zeng stressed that attention should be paid to protecting the marine environment while developing maritime agriculture .
