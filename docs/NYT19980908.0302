MARAKET LIKES GREENSPAN COMMENT ; DOW JONES SOARS 380 POINTS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By PETER G. GOSSELIN c.1998 The Boston Globe
NEW YORK _ The stock market , which has carried investors on a wild downward ride during the last two weeks , shot through the ceiling Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the nation 's central bank might cut interest rates to offset an economic slowdown .
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 380 points , its largest one-day point gain ever .
Following investors around the world , who had an extra day to digest Greenspan 's Friday remarks because of the Labor Day holiday here , US stock buyers sent share prices flying at the opening bell and barely looked back .
The 30-stock Dow gained almost five percent to close at 8020.78 .
The computer-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 94.32 points , or more than six percent , to close at 1660.84 , its second largest point gain .
An interest rate cut would help American companies by prolonging the nation 's economic boom , which started in April 1991 and is approaching a peacetime record .
But analysts conceded that a rate cut alone would not solve the mounting problems in Russia , Asia and elsewhere that have frightened investors in recent weeks .
They traced the upward bound in stock prices both here and abroad to relief among investors that someone is finally turning attention to the world situation .
`` Greenspan speech didn n't change any of the fundamental problems in the world economy '' said Mickey D. Levy , chief economist with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in New York , `` But it counts when somebody as powerful as he is steps in and says the Fed will act if a major crevice opens in the world financial system . ''
Tuesday 's rally saw the Dow stocks gain back most of what they lost in last week 's five-percent market plunge , but that still left the bellweather average _ and the market as a whole _ well below their highs for the year .
Before the rally , the Dow had lost almost 1,700 points , or 18 percent of its value , from its mid-July peak .
Before last week , a worsening economic crisis in Asia that has spread to Russia and Latin America had many investors convinced that free markets were in retreat worldwide and that it was only a matter of time before the long US boom ended .
The result was a broad selloff .
In his Friday speech in Berkeley , Calif. , Greenspan alluded to those fears , warning that the United States `` can n't remain an oasis ( in ) a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress , '' and hinting that the Fed is no longer as worried about boom-spurred inflation as it is of recession .
Although the Fed chairman never said that an interest rate cut is imminent , he took the unusual step of disclosing that the central bank 's governing board changed its internal policy last month from one of tilting toward a rate hike to one that makes a rate cut as likely as not .
That was all global investors wanted to hear .
`` With the market as violently oversold as it was by Friday , investors were looking for a reason to buy , '' said Richard B. Hoey , chief economist with The Dreyfus Corp. , which manages more than $ 100 billion .
`` If it hadn n't been Alan Grenspan , it would have been something else , ' he said .
Tuesday 's buying binge was especially good news for stocks battered in the recent market plunge , particularly those of financial institutions and computer companies .
Among the big financial gainers were American Express , up 6 3 / 8 to 80 ; J.P .
Morgan & AMP ; Co , up 3 9 / 16 to 90 1 / 2 , and Citicorp , up 6 3 / 16 to 98 11 / 16 .
BankBoston shares , which lost more than 40 percent of their value since peaking in July , rose 1 13 / 16 to 37 .
Leading the computer comeback was Dell Computer , whose shares had fallen nearly one third despite recently reporting record profits .
Dell was up 5 3 / 16 to 59 15 / 16 .
The big question now is whether the rally will continue or falter , and some analysts said they saw signs of weakness .
For starters , most of the gains were among the so-called big capitalization stocks rather than smaller firms , a sign , according to some , that investors are still edgy about the market 's prospects and eager to avoid risky bets .
While both the Dow and the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 Index , which include most big companies ' shares , rose five percent , the Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks gained a somewhat more modest 4.22 percent .
In addition , the runup comes just as analysts are about to begin issuing their latest quarterly profit predictions , and all signs point to a string of disappointments .
For example , while analysts began the three-month quarter in July predicting that profits of the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 companies would jumped 10 percent , they now believe profits will rise a mere 1.6 percent , and further reductions are on the way .
& UR ; & LR ; `` Nothing much has changed since Friday , '' said Richard O. Lodewick , reseach director with Boston Partners Asset Management , which manages $ 17 billion .
`` The prospect for growth of US comanies have not changed signifcantly because of what Alan Greenspan said . ''
