GORDON IN MIDDLE OF JETS ' DEFENSE
( nk ) By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ Amid the hand-wringing after Marvin Jones ' season-ending injury , the speculation about whether Pepper Johnson can replace Jones and the arrival of Bryan Cox , one Jet has remained unfazed .
And he is the man who is playing middle linebacker for the Jets , instead of one of those three more-noted performers .
Dwayne Gordon simply keeps making plays .
Sunday in practice , he tore through the line on third-and-8 to strip the ball from Glenn Foley and disrupt an offensive series .
And Gordon may have been the Jets ' most dominating defensive player in the opening half of their victory in the exhibition opener at Philadelphia last Thursday .
He had a game-high six tackles in the half , including five unassisted .
So he will continue in that role against the Baltimore Ravens at Giants Stadium on Saturday , while Johnson backs him up and Cox still tries to get used to playing the outside once more .
Jones will undergo surgery next week for ligament damage in his left knee .
Perhaps Gordon , who is 28 , should have been able to generate big plays before this .
But he conceded Sunday that he had to grow up as a pro football player after the Jets signed him a year ago , after two seasons each with Atlanta and San Diego .
`` I remember after my first scrimmage with the Jets , Bill Parcells said to me , ` Why didn n't you play like that in San Diego ? '' ' Gordon said .
`` I didn n't want to tell him because I was hurt .
He said , ` Was it because you were fat and out of shape ? '' '
Gordon admits that that may have been part of the reason , along with the nagging knee injury .
When he joined the Falcons as a rookie free agent in 1993 , he admits , he did not like to watch films .
He also did not watch his weight .
`` I just didn n't figure it out in terms of being a professional , '' he said .
`` By the time I got to San Diego , I realized that watching films isn n't all that tedious . ''
Still , he never started more than three games in a season until last year with the Jets , when Johnson suffered a quadriceps injury in the eighth game that ended his season .
Gordon was the starter the rest of the year .
He produced some big games , including an 11-tackle effort against the Colts .
So when Jones was injured , the Jets did not have to make significant changes .
They stayed with Gordon , who desperately wanted the opportunity to start again .
`` Your attitude changes after you 've had something and don n't want to lose it , '' he said .
`` My confidence was always there .
I was just waiting for the chance . ''
Gordon grew up in White Plains , N.Y . , and went to high school near Poughkeepsie in LaGrangeville , N.Y .
From there , he attended the University of New Hampshire , more noted , perhaps , for its hockey team than for its football team .
`` I used to get $ 10 a game as an usher at the hockey games , '' he said .
`` I liked to watch the girls in the stands . ''
Gordon is extremely coachable , said Al Groh , who tutors the Jets linebackers .
Coaches like his intelligence and his ability to absorb information , which offsets to some degree his average size of 6 feet 1 inch and 240 pounds .
With Jones , the Jets thought their linebacking unit was as good as anybody 's .
Teamed with Mo Lewis and James Farrior , Gordon might still be able to help the linebackers become the strongest unit on the club .
Cox is being groomed for the outside , where Parcells hopes he can be used as a disruptive pass rusher .
`` Do we have one of the best linebacking units ? ''
Gordon said .
`` That remains to be seen .
On paper we do . ''
