Pakistani Shooter Fails Doping Test
KUALA LUMPUR , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- An unnamed Pakistani shooter was disqualified from the Commonwealth Games for failing a doping test , officials said here on Monday .
The shooter , whom the organizers hold back the name , was found to have used beta-blockers , a banned substance that can help lessen the heart rate to control the shaking of their hands , said Michael Fennell , chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation .
The disqualification was the sole doping incident reported at the 16th Commonwealth Games , which were ending later Monday .
Fennel said the federation was not looking at the possibility of introducing blood tests .
Urine tests now are used to check for use of banned drugs .
