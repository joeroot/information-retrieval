Lesotho Insurance Companies Not to Pay September
JOHANNESBURG , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Most claims by Lesotho business people for compensation on their businesses destroyed during a week of violence in September would not be paid , an insurance official has said .
Addressing a special meeting of the Lesotho Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( LCCI ) in Maseru , Claims Manager for the Lesotho National Insurance Group , Tlai Tlai , said that the businessmen could not be paid because the September disturbances were not constituted as political riots , South African Press Association reported Sunday .
Lesotho suffered a national turmoil in mid-September which witnessed looting and arson in the capital of Maseru following a one-and-half month political unrest resulted from allegation by opposition parties that the May election was rigged .
The mountain kingdom returned to normal in early October after military intervention by neighboring South Africa and Botswana .
Tlai said it was found that most buinesses destroyed in Maseru and the southern towns of Mafeteng and Mohales Hoek were not insured for political riots which were not covered by the Lesotho National Insurance Group .
What Tlai said had drawn castigation from angry businessmen who maintained that they should be compensated for damages on their businesses during the uprising .
There are only two insurance companies in Lesotho , and persons who wish to be insured by foreign companies have to do so through insurance brokers .
It was reported that by the time turmoil occurred , most businesses had no insurance coverage but some had standard insurance against storm , theft and other forms of disaster .
Tlai said wrap around insurance cover for large businesses such as five-star hotels and big industrial undertakings was not available in Lesotho because the market was not large enough .
Thabang Nyeoe , deputy chairman of the LCCI Crisis Committee , said that individual business people may wish to take legal action against insurance companies which refused to make any payments .
