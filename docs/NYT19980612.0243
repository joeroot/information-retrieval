EVEN INTIMIDATOR GLAD TO RIDE ALONG IN ESPN 'S COMMERCIALS
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Dale Earnhardt is not known as the Man in Black for nothing .
There are those who say the nickname is perfect for a man of his disposition .
But when ESPN called last year and asked him to appear in a TV commercial with a dog , NASCAR 's most prominent driver jumped at the chance .
The next thing you know , Earnhardt 's heading into Turn 1 with a pooch in the back seat sticking its pointy head out the window to catch some 180-mph breeze .
Earnhardt playing straight man to a mutt ?
A lot of Winston Cup drivers are proud to be the middle man in the joke , it seems , so long as it 's part of ESPN 's `` ride-along '' advertising campaign that promotes their circuit .
Now in its second year , the spots feature racers with ballplayers , racers with cabbies , even racers with iguanas .
All ride along in the back seat and trade oddball dialogue with the drivers who do their best not to crack up _ as they try not to crack up .
There 's Jeff Gordon , another driver not exactly known for his whimsical side , being told by a New York City taxi driver that trolling the mean streets of the Bronx , at night , is a lot scarier way to make a living than tempting the wall at Talladega .
There 's Kyle Petty getting the full back-seat driver treatment from his old man , who , in this case , happens to be stock-car legend Richard Petty .
And there 's Mark Martin , in perhaps the funniest spot , trying to negotiate the corners as New York Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson attempts to snag a wayward football pass .
Also performing : Dale Jarrett , Ricky Craven , Terry Labonte and Rusty Wallace .
`` I enjoyed doing it , '' Jarrett said recently .
`` Some of these kinds of things aren n't much fun to do , but ESPN made these fun . ''
`` I had a good time last year doing mine , and this year they talked my dad into doing one with me , '' Kyle Petty said .
`` I like mine , but I like Mark Martin 's best . ''
In his solo spot , Petty is practicing some stand-up comic material while a cheesy drummer sits in the back seat .
`` I used to be a grease monkey , '' Petty deadpans , `` but let me tell you ...
it was the pits . ''
To that , the drummer bangs a rim shot .
Bah-dum , bum !
As much fun as the participating drivers had making the commercials ( Earnhardt wanted back in for a second spot this season , but couldn n't work it into his schedule ) , they see a greater purpose .
That 's promoting NASCAR .
`` I think the commercials have helped NASCAR quite a bit , '' Jarrett said .
`` They help people recognize drivers ' faces a little bit more because they can see us without our helmets on or wearing an open-faced helmet .
It 's a big plus for the sport . ''
Rusty Wallace couldn n't do an ESPN spot in 1997 , the first year of the campaign , because of other commitments .
But when he saw the commercial work of his fellow competitors , `` he went out of his way to clear his schedule this year to make sure he could do it , '' Wallace spokesman Tom Roberts said .
In one commercial , Wallace engages in a round of barb-tossing with Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina .
Said Wallace : `` It 's a neat deal that really helps promote the sport .
It puts us in the mainstream .
This is a chance to be an ambassador for the sport . ''
That attitude has gone a long way in making stock-car racing the favorite of motorsports fans .
ESPN , which broadcasts NASCAR races as well as weekly feature programs on motorsports , says the spots have been well-received .
`` We really believe NASCAR is one of the sports , if not the only sport , where there is a really strong connection between the ( athlete ) and the fan .
There 's an accessibility there we wanted to capitalize on , '' said Alex Kaminsky , director of advertising and program marketing for ESPN .
Kaminsky said he believes that race fans and novices alike can relate to the commercials .
`` All of us have thrown a baseball , '' he said .
`` We 've caught a down-and-out or made a basket .
But how many of us have gotten in a $ 250,000 car and driven at 180 miles per hour ? ''
The Winston Cup drivers chosen for the ESPN commercials didn n't get the chance to pick their ride-along partners , but some racers had definite ideas of who they would want with them , if given the choice .
`` I 'd pick Terry Bradshaw , '' Jarrett said .
`` I liked him when he was playing , and with his competitive nature , I think he 'd enjoy going around as fast as we want to go . ''
Petty had different ideas , though , perhaps because he has always had King Richard as a back-seat driver , so to speak .
`` Probably Marcel Marceau , '' Petty said .
`` He 'd keep his mouth shut and wouldn n't say anything . ''
