Township Enterprises Contribute to Poverty Relief Efforts
ZHENGZHOU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- An increasing number of people have come to see the importance of township enterprises in helping eliminate poverty in China .
An Agriculture Ministry official says that the central government will try everything to develop township enterprises to help the economy in western parts of the country and has added about a billion yuan in low-interest loans and other favorable funding policies .
The government will also train all township enterprise workers and technicians in a year or two .
Township enterprises contribute a third of the country 's GDP , but in central and western parts of China , where two-thirds of the people live , they produce considerable less .
Township enterprises in developed coastal areas provide 80 percent of farmers ' income , while those in central and western regions provide less than eight percent .
And , the majority of China 's 50 million impoverished people live in these regions .
Local governments have put the development of township enterprise high on their agenda .
Gansu Province has listed township enterprises as its top development priority .
To make the most of the resources in the west and the technology in the east coastal region , pilot projects were launched in 1995 to faciliate the growth of townships in the western region and this has called for a total investment of 75 billion yuan , 40 billion yuan injected from the East , in more than 40,000 cooperative projects .
But these measures are still not enough , insiders say , so banks have intervened , and township enterprises are looking forward to more loans .
The central and local governments are also taking steps to improve infrastructure , provide more preferential policies , and set up various training centers .
