HK Tourist Arrivals in August Hit 15-Month High
HONG KONG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong hit a 15-month high in August and also registered year-on-year growth for the second consecutive month this year , according to figures released by the Hong Kong Tourist Association ( HKTA ) Monday .
The 859,310 visitors were up 4.9 percent from August 1997 and were the highest monthly arrivals since May 1997 , HKTA said .
" This is encouraging , " said HKTA Executive Director Amy Chan .
" While the economic problem in the region will continue to have a negative impact on travel , we are hopeful this modest recovery can be sustained , " Chan said .
" Relatively speaking , Hong Kong is holding its own in its margin above other regional destinations , and continues to be the most popular destination in Asia after China 's mainland , " she said .
The biggest growth market in August was China 's mainland -- up 35.1 percent to 267,839 visitors .
This was due partly to the 30 percent increase in the tour group quota , which came into effect on July 1 this year , as well as in contrast to the restricted travel from the mainland this time last year , Chan said .
Other markets that showed good growth in August were the Netherlands , up 32.6 percent to 4,939 visitors , Britain , up by 22.9 percent to 22 , 036 , and Canada , up 13 percent to 14 , 332 .
Meanwhile , Chan said the HKTA welcomes Hong Kong 's Cathay Pacific Airways ' alliance with other major world airlines .
On Monday , Cathay Pacific , British Airways , American Airlines , Canadian Airlines and Qantas of Australia announced a loose alliance called " oneworld " to integrate some of their customer services for the global marketplace .
Chan said this alliance will be a boom to travelers coming to Hong Kong , easing transfers and opening up new source markets .
It also further consolidates Hong Kong as the regional aviation hub .
" The HKTA looks forward to establishing new marketing initiatives with Cathay Pacific 's alliance partners , " she said .
