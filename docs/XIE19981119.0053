Blair Attacks Conservatives for Blocking European Bill
LONDON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair attacked on Wednesday the opposition Conservative Party , accusing it of using the dominance in the unelected House of Lords to kill an important piece of European legislation .
" The row between the government and the Lords over plans to change European ballots is no longer about voting rights but Tory hereditary peers defying elected MPs , " Blair said in a speech in parliament .
The upper chamber of Britain 's parliament on Tuesday night passed for a fourth time a wrecking amendment to a government bill to change the way Britain 's 87 members of the European Parliament are elected .
The measure is set to go back to the Commons , then the Lords , on Wednesday evening .
Blair said the battle had now come down to Tory hereditary peers versus an elected House of Commons .
" It is not just the fact that hereditary peers can decide policy in the House of Lords , " he said .
" The inbuilt Tory majority which is three-to-one in the House of Lords , that means whatever the election result they can use the House of Lords to over turn the will of the House of Commons .
That is not democracy . "
Blair 's official spokesman said the government is now prepared to abandon the legislation if the Lords refuse to back down .
