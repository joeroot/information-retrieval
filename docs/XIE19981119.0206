Late President 's Legacy Still Valuable for China : Officials ( 2 )
He enumerated Liu 's important principles on Party work , which he said are of great realistic significance for today 's building of the CPC .
These principles are :
-- The political party in power must pay attention to the education , management , and supervision of its members , especially its leading officials ;
-- Leading officials must strengthen their confidence with Communism , always put the interests of the people at the top of all their priorities , and whole-heartedly serve the people ;
-- The " special privilege " mentality must be criticized and rooted out , as well as the tendency to treat the people as subjects and bureaucratic practices .
Liu also gave comprehensive explanations of the working rules of democratic centralization concerning Party work , Wei said .
Studying and learning Liu 's ideas are conducive to the anti-corruption drive within the Party and will help improve the leadership role of the Party , he said .
Gu and Wang served as vice premier and vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , respectively .
Gu said that in the era when political campaigns overwhelmed all others , Liu was persistent in proposing that the Party should focus on economic construction after the founding of New China , and China must steadily develop its economy on the basis of the realities .
Wang Hanbin said that the first NPC Standing Committee promulgated some 80 laws and decrees , and laid foundations for the legal framework of New China .
Liu 's words on democracy and the rule of law should also be remembered today .
