Legislature Poll Guidelines to Be Published in HK
HONG KONG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The guidelines covering electoral law and matters related to electors and candidates for Hong Kong Legislative Council elections will be published here Saturday .
This was announced by Justice Woo Kwok-hing , chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission ( EAC ) , at a press conference here Friday Morning .
The guidelines , which have been revised by the government after public consultations last December , also include those for conducting the Election Committee subsector elections on April 2 and the general legislature election on May 24 .
Rules on electioneering activities and various avenues for lodging complaints are also included .
Noting that a total of 23 written representations were received during the public consultation exercise , Woo said all views considered reasonable and practicable have been adopted .
" One major modification to the proposed guidelines published last year concerns combined polling arrangements , " he said , adding : " All electors , except the 800 Election Committee members , may cast their votes at a polling station near their homes on May 24 . "
According to the guidelines , the nomination period for the subsector elections will run from March 13 to 20 .
For the Legislative Council general election , nomination will last from April 9 to 24 .
A candidate , and in the case of a geographical constituency list one of the candidates , on the list should submit his nomination paper in person to the relevant Returning Officer , Woo said .
He said public spots will be located to the candidates for displaying election advertisements with their mutual consent or by the drawing of lots after nomination closes .
No display of election advertisements will be allowed on any designated spots before the allocation , he stressed .
The 60-member Legislative Council will be made up of 20 to be returned by geographical constituencies through direct election , 30 by functional constituencies and 10 by an 800-member Election Committee .
