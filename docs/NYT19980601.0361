NEW YORK _ The smile , to tell the truth , is a little scary .
Worn fixedly by Josef Sommer in `` Labor Day , '' A.R .
Gurney 's new play at the Manhattan Theater Club , it has a beleaguered , on-the-edge quality , like that of a long-persecuted martyr who is finally about to crack .
A playwright who bears more than a passing resemblance to his creator and who first appeared in Gurney 's 1988 hit comedy , `` The Cocktail Hour , '' Sommer 's character smiles hard while quoting sentimental passages from Dickens , enumerating the virtues of his children and listening to a hot-shot young theater director tell him frankly what 's wrong with his latest play .
The smile may be part of an armor of willed benevolence for a man who has recently been seriously ill , but you half expect this guy to pull a pistol out of his well-worn khakis and start shooting anyone in his line of vision .
Nothing of the sort happens , of course .
This is the world of Gurney , deft chronicler through 20-some plays of the vanishing American species called WASP , and people don n't do such things there .
The Land of Gurney is as circumscribed and rule-ridden as that of Jane Austen ; his characters may complain , but they certainly don n't `` act out , '' especially not in front of an audience .
Gurney has been criticized for the limitations of his plays ' subjects , and so , not surprisingly , has John , his alter ego in `` Labor Day . ''
In this stiff and , by Gurney 's standards , strangely awkward comedy , which opened last night , those criticisms are addressed at length .
So is the dilemma of the writer who is torn between life and art and who preys upon his own family for material .
John considers these issues , with his wife and children and with a professional colleague , in a manner wedged between apology and accusation .
He lashes out wittily a couple of times , and on one occasion erupts into full temper .
Mostly , though , he is as determinedly humble as Uriah Heep .
And like the play in which he appears , he seems hamstrung by self-consciousness .
Gurney probably shouldn n't listen to his critics .
When he tries to answer them , either directly or by expanding his thematic horizons , his plays , which can be delightful , start to feel uncomfortable and inauthentic .
`` Overtime , '' his modern-day sequel to `` The Merchant of Venice , '' seen at the Manhattan Theater Club two seasons ago , seriously misfired as a jaunty , wisecracking look at levels of American ethnic identity .
`` Labor Day '' is so busy anticipating what might be said against it that it never gets down to the business of creating full , breathing characters .
Though sparked by instances of Gurney 's agile wit , the evening , directed by Jack O ' Brien , feels mostly like a checklist of concepts , of ingredients that never merge into a natural flow of life .
This isn n't true of the work to which `` Labor Day '' is a sequel of sorts .
In `` The Cocktail Hour , '' John visits his parents to seek their approval for a play he has written more or less about them .
As Mom and Dad express their displeasure at the idea of such public exposure , they make a sad and often witty case for the lives they have led , embodied by the ritual of evening cocktails .
The play suffered from contrivance , but it gleamed with eloquence .
`` Labor Day '' finds John defending the world his parents defended to him , trying to hold on to his `` own small circles of civility '' in a turbulent age .
He is also again in the position of having his latest play , a self-portrait of the artist as an older man , attacked .
This time , his attackers are both the work 's subjects , his wife , Ellen ( Joyce Van Patten ) , and his children , Ralph ( James Colby ) and Ginny ( Veanne Cox ) , and its director , Dennis ( Brooks Ashmanskas ) , who is gay , hip and well versed in the political demands of institutional theater .
