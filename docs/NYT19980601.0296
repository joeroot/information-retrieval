CALIFORNIA MAY END BILINGUAL EDUCATION
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By RON HUTCHESON c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
WASHINGTON _ California , a bellwether for the nation on issues such as affirmative action and property taxes , is about to make an assault on bilingual education .
California voters are expected to approve a ballot initiative Tuesday that would effectively dismantle the state 's bilingual program .
Polls have consistently shown strong support for the proposal among both Anglos and Hispanics .
A Los Angeles Times poll conducted May 16 - 20 found that 63 percent of likely voters favor the initiative .
While passage of the referendum would almost certainly draw legal challenges from the federal government and groups in California , conservatives in Congress are counting on a big vote against bilingual education to boost their efforts to end federal support for bilingual programs .
`` The political momentum is going our way , '' said Jim Boulet Jr. , executive director of English First .
`` Parents have been demanding English for their children .
Now the politicians are catching up . ''
Although bilingual programs vary widely from school to school , their general aim is to help students with limited English by offering instruction in the students ' native language .
At least 1.3 million students take bilingual classes in the United States , including more than 440,000 in Texas .
The California initiative , Proposition 227 , would replace bilingual education with a `` sink or swim '' approach .
Students with limited English would be placed in English immersion classes for a year , then shifted to regular classes unless they obtained a special waiver .
The proposal has ignited an emotional debate that has little to do with education theory .
The language issue has become a flash point in a much larger dispute over the nation 's cultural identity .
While one side talks of the need for a unifying national language , the other champions the benefits of a multilingual society .
More than 3 million students have limited English skills , and immigrant children are the fastest-growing segment of the school population .
`` The English-only nuts are people who are offended by hearing people speaking another language .
It 's as simple as that , '' said Rep. Matthew Martinez , D-Calif .
`` They want to think that the only intelligent people in this world speak English . ''
Although both sides in the dispute agree that a repudiation of bilingual education in California would give bilingual critics new momentum , no one expects an immediate rollback of bilingual education in other states .
Bilingual education is widespread and growing in Texas , and educators say they don n't expect the California vote to change their plans .
In El Paso 's Ysleta Independent School District , which is 85 percent Hispanic , bilingual classes are offered in all grades .
Ysleta Superintendent Anthony Trujillo said the district 's goal is for every student to graduate fluent in two languages .
`` This whole discussion is a no-brainer .
Is it better to know one language or two , or three ? ''
Trujillo asked .
`` We are producing students that are superior to those educated only in English .
Who do you think will get the better job in the global economy ? ''
But some of the opposition to bilingual education in California has come from the very people it is supposed to help .
The drive for California 's anti-bilingual initiative began in an impoverished immigrant neighborhood in East Los Angeles .
In early 1996 , about 90 children boycotted bilingual classes at the Ninth Street School for two weeks until school officials agreed to provide more English instruction .
`` The parents are garment workers .
It 's very simple to them .
If the schools don n't teach English , their kids don n't have a chance , '' said Alice Callaghan , who runs Las Familias del Pueblo , a storefront community center that served as boycott headquarters .
`` They don n't want their kids working in sweatshops or selling tamales on the corner . ''
News accounts of the boycott caught the attention of Ron Unz , a Silicon Valley multimillionaire who became the driving force behind Proposition 227 .
Parental discontent isn n't limited to California .
In 1995 , a group of about 150 families in Brooklyn , N.Y . , sued Community School District 32 over the district 's policy of retaining Spanish-speaking students in bilingual education for up to six years .
The suit was dismissed a year later , but some parents are as skeptical as ever .
`` They don n't give enough English .
The kids are not really getting good in English , '' said Marino De La Cruz , who had his children removed from bilingual classes .
`` It 's going to be very difficult for them in the future because they don n't have a strong base . ''
De La Cruz , who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1981 , said he favors some bilingual education , but `` not year after year after year . ''
To be sure , many immigrant parents welcome bilingual education .
A classroom full of English speakers can be a terrifying place to a child who does not know the language .
Educators who favor bilingual instruction say the teaching method gives immigrant students the solid academic footing they need to master English , math and other subjects .
`` Bilingual education is simply a tool for children to learn English , '' said Mary Helen Berlanga of Corpus Christi , a member of the State Board of Education .
`` The ultimate goal of every bilingual program is to get the child proficient in English . ''
But bilingual supporters also concede that many bilingual programs have been hampered by bureaucratic snafus and a lack of trained teachers .
As part of an effort to defeat the California proposal , Education Secretary Richard Riley recently urged schools to push students out of bilingual education after three years .
He denounced the much tougher California plan as `` an educational straitjacket '' that ignores individual student needs .
If California voters approve the measure , House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land said he intends to seek a vote this summer on his bill to eliminate the federal Office of Bilingual Education .
The $ 200 million federal program offers grants and other help to local bilingual programs .
