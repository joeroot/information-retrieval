China to Improve Yangtze River Environment
CHENGDU , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Southwest China 's Sichuan Province plans substantial environmental improvements in 14 counties in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River .
Related counties sustained heavy damage during this summer 's record flooding .
The province will earmark initial central government and local funding totalling 200 million yuan ( 24.15 million U.S. dollars ) for erosion control and environmental improvement projects in the counties .
The environmental projects will focus on afforestation , protecting afforested mountain areas , river purification and the closure of small factories and mines which create serious pollution .
Excessive logging in virgin forests , illegal mining and the lost of forest areas to encroaching farmland have adversely impacted the environment in the Yangtze River Valley .
Erosion has spread from 60,000 sq.km .
in the 1950s to some 110,000 sq.km . , with over 600 million tons of silt flowing into the Three Gorge Dam area on an annual basis .
Experts have , at least in part , attributed this year 's heavy summer flooding to poor ecological conditions in the upper reaches of the Yangtze .
Sichuan Province led the nation in banning logging in virgin forests on October 1 as part of an extensive effort to prevent the Yangtze from becoming the country 's second Yellow River .
