Sudan to Mediate Between Iran , Taliban
KHARTOUM , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Sudan has offered to mediate between Iran and the Afghan Taliban militia in an effort to prevent their crisis from developing into military confrontation .
The press adviser of the Sudanese president , Al Sadeq Bakheit said Sunday that the idea of Sudanese mediation has emerged as an attempt to bring about rapprochement .
The Sudan will send within two days two delegations , an official one to Tehran and another non-official one to Kabul .
They will carry letters to Iranian and Taliban leaders , appealing for non escalation of the current conflict to confrontation , he said .
Bakheit quoted the letters as reading that " any negative development will be in the interest of the enemies of the Islamic nation , and will not serve the cause of either country nor the Islamic world . "
Sudan will call upon the two sides to resort to diplomatic channels to resolve their differences , he said .
Denying some reports , Bakheit stressed that Sudan is leaning towards neither side of the crisis .
The tension between Iran and the Taliban heightened recently after the Taliban killed nine Iranian diplomats and reporter in northern Afghanistan .
Amassing troops on border , Tehran threatens to take revenge .
On Iran 's attitude towards Sudan 's mediation , a delegation source said it was " encouraging , " adding he has received assurances that Tehran would not resort to force until it exploited all diplomatic means to resolve the crisis . "
