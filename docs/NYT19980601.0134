Carol Hersh-Weiss collects , and then some .
To enter her sprawling New York City apartment is to venture into the nooks and crannies of her decidedly idiosyncratic mind .
Along one wall are 19 pairs of shoes , a small part of a collection of black shoes .
Elsewhere soda bottles bearing forgotten brand names like `` Cheer Up , '' `` Dream '' and `` Just Whistle . ''
Hidden in a drawer are thousands of erasers , including one shaped like Ronald Reagan 's head .
Antique quilts are everywhere , well over 100 the last time anybody counted .
They have multiplied in value 10 times over in the last 15 years , with many worth more than $ 1 , 000 .
Mrs. Hersh-Weiss , a professional potter , has told her husband , Norman , a mathematician at Queens College , that quilts beat the stock market hands down .
`` I can make more money on my quilts than he can on Microsoft and Intel , '' she said .
`` He 's not going to double his money and I am . ''
Ms. Hersh-Weiss 's optimism is shared by millions of other Americans who are taking advantage of the strong economy to collect stamps and coins as well as used beer cans in the hope that they will increase in value .
One in three Americans collect something .
Most of them don n't care that collectibles , which is a term for items made solely for the enjoyment of the collector , have historically decreased in value than increased .
They are more concerned about the proliferation of fakes .
Trade magazines estimate the collectibles market to be approaching $ 10 billion in annual sales , and stories of resale are legend .
The Jetsons lunch box bought for $ 1 at a garage sale in 1980 fetching $ 200 today .
The 1955 Murray fire truck that sold for $ 50 in 1993 worth $ 250 .
The unused Hawaiian missionary stamp selling for $ 575 , 000 .
Today , much of the collectibles action is on the Internet , where millions participate in auctions held at hundreds of sites .
It helps to be in the news .
Frank Sinatra memorabilia is suddenly hot .
All things connected with the millennium items will be collected .
But white-hot publicity can be as fleeting as a sound bite : When Princess Diana died , autographed pictures that had been worth $ 1,500 immediately jumped to $ 50 , 000 .
The price has since drifted back to about $ 3 , 500 .
`` Given the amount of material related to the events surrounding Princess Diana 's death and burial , it is safe to assume that supply will exceed demand for centuries , not decades , to come , '' wrote Harry L. Rinker in Antiques & AMP ; Collecting Magazine .
`` Even if 90 percent ends up in the landfill , supply will exceed demand . ''
Nowhere is the supply-and-demand equation more in evidence than in the area of instant heirlooms .
The Franklin Mint sells them by the hundreds of thousands , including its non-firing replica of Wyatt Earp 's six-shooter and a 24-inch porcelain doll of Marilyn Monroe in a feathered headdress .
The company is in the business of selling the glorious illusions that most resonate with the average person .
It bought Jacqueline Onassis 's faux pearls for $ 211,500 at auction and made replicas that became runaway best sellers at $ 195 each .
But true value hinges on scarcity _ a bitter truth learned by the 17th - century Dutch when speculators drove the price of tulips to astronomic levels , only to see it crash with an abundant tulip harvest .
Today collectors seem motivated more by love , often tinged with nostalgia , than by thoughts of making a killing .
`` People end up buying themselves a present in a way that means something , '' said Alan Manevitz , a psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center who has personally collected 25,000 comic books ; baseballs autographed by Babe Ruth , Joe Dimaggio , Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra , and Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers ray guns .
Still , Manevitz worries that people , including some of his patients , become & UR ; too & LR ; obsessed .
`` You shouldn n't define yourself through your things , '' he said , sounding almost convincing .
`` I just lose myself in it , '' said Hank Seiden , an avid collector who runs an advertising agency in his spare time .
From the time he bought bought an F.D.R .
autograph for $ 5 as a teen-ager , he has always set a goal in his collecting .
He now owns the signatures of all United States presidents , and all members of Yankees teams in 1927 , 1941 , 1951 and 1961 .
`` I 'm not a nut , '' he volunteered .
Luck matters in collecting .
On May 24 , Yankee Stadium offered a free Beanie Baby to every child .
Produced in limited quantities , other versions of the plush toys have gotten prices of nearly $ 3 , 000 , but the financial windfall , finally , seems to be ebbing .
Except perhaps for the free teddy bears given out by the Yanks : Each of these carries a certificate with the date of the game when David Wells pitched a perfect game .
A cuddly , properly dated specimen already resides in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown .
