This kind of story research I could get used to .
`` Pull on your earlobes , '' Tracy Walton tells me over the telephone .
`` Now go all the way around , pinching your earlobe gently between your fingers .
Now squeeze your eyebrows with your thumb and index finger .
`` Feel that point where your brow meets the bridge of your nose ?
Push up right there , real gently .
Isn n't it amazing how sensitive that is ? ''
The question needs no response .
A massage therapist and head of the science department at the Muscular Therapy Institute in Cambridge , Mass. , Walton knows the answer .
`` It 's a funny thing , '' she says .
`` Massage is booming , but very few people think about self-massage .
There 's still a sort of rhetoric that you need to get a massage from someone else .
But self-massage has benefits , too . ''
You may know that traditional massage _ one person administering a massage to another _ improves circulation and reduces muscle tension and stress .
You may be surprised to learn , though , that massage may also help migraines , colic , diabetes and hyperactivity .
Massage has helped asthmatics breathe more easily , improved autistic children 's ability to concentrate and boosted immune function in HIV-positive patients .
But traditional massage has its drawbacks .
For one , it 's expensive .
Not everyone can afford $ 50 for a 45-minute session on a regular basis .
Traditional massage also requires a massage therapist , and one isn n't always handy .
But you yourself are both accessible and cheap .
And all that 's required to perform effective self-massage is a little knowledge , a little time and a little change of mindset .
Just ask Bob McAtee , a Colorado Springs , Colo . - based massage therapist with a client list of top-notch athletes .
McAtee isn n't averse to massaging himself while seated at a traffic light or on a plane _ `` I 'll do my hands , forearms and shoulders , since I use them a lot .
`` Five minutes of self-massage on the neck and shoulders will make a huge difference in the way you feel , '' McAtee says .
`` Done regularly , self-massage can really help reduce chronic tightness and improve the circulation in trouble spots like the neck and back .
It helps keep your muscles healthier . ''
If you 're enjoying a degree of privacy , your feet _ much abused and filled with tension _ are a great place to start .
Five minutes of foot massage can work wonders , Walton says .
Try it right before you go to sleep _ on the road , those little hotel bottles of lotion make an ideal massage oil .
The face is another repository for tightness and stress , and a few minutes of facial massage will release muscular tension and shake out the cobwebs .
Simply scratching and rubbing the scalp , Walton says , accesses a host of tight scalp and neck muscles .
Hard-to-reach places can be addressed , too .
`` If you 're traveling or sitting at your desk , take a tennis ball and place it between your lower back or your shoulders and the seat , '' Walton says .
`` Rolling gently around on it has the same effect as someone else 's hands . ''
This piecemeal approach can be applied in any fashion .
Massaging your legs for five to 10 minutes after a run , McAtee says , helps flush accumulated waste products from traumatized muscles , letting you recover from workouts faster and with less soreness .
Desk-bound folk can greatly reduce chronic tightness by indulging in a few minutes of self-massage several times during the work day _ maybe the hands and forearms if you clack away at a keyboard , or the neck and shoulders if you feel tight there .
McAtee still recommends an occasional massage from a professional .
But the beauty of self-massage is that it can be part of every day .
`` With massage , it 's long-term consistency that really brings results , '' he says .
`` Daily self-massage is a wonderful way to get more in tune with your body and take good care of it . ''
Nor do you need the magic hands of a professional masseuse to perform self-massage .
`` Do you need to know technique to give yourself an effective massage ?
Absolutely not , '' Walton says .
`` A lesson or a few techniques can help .
But it 's your body _ you know what feels good . ''
Strangely enough , the biggest roadblock to the benefits of self-massage is mental .
Americans are flocking to massage therapists in record numbers _ some 25 million Americans make about 60 million visits to massage therapists each year .
But self-massage is still largely ignored .
`` It 's bizarre , '' Walton says .
`` I think there 's this unspoken taboo in our culture about getting pleasure or relaxation from touching our own bodies . ''
For those afflicted by guilt or skepticism , McAtee has some simple advice :
`` If you don n't try self-massage , you won n't know , '' he says .
`` Do it four to five times over the course of two weeks and see what you think . ''
& UR ; SIDEBAR : AH , THERE 'S THE RUB & LR ; & QL ;
Self-massage can be done when , where and however you like .
`` That 's the beauty of self-massage , '' massage therapist Bob McAtee says .
`` With the exception of making sure it doesn n't hurt , there are no hard-and-fast rules . ''
But if you want to get a bit more out of your self-massage , McAtee offers a few ground rules :
+ General technique .
No matter what body part you 're working on , it 's best to start with large , vigorous strokes that involve the entire muscle .
Large strokes include rolling , kneading or long , gliding strokes along the entire length of the muscle .
Follow these with smaller strokes working across the grain of the muscle , to help separate and relax the muscle fibers .
Use moderate thumb pressure to relieve tender spots or muscle knots .
Then finish up with large strokes again .
+ The feet .
Squeeze , rub and poke .
Use your thumbs , fingers or knuckles to dig a bit deeper around tender spots , then do some soothing strokes with the flat of your hand .
As with tender spots anywhere on your body , work them for 30 to 60 seconds , then move away and come back a few minutes later .
If your fingers get tired , try a wooden spoon , a golf ball or some other blunt object to apply pressure to tender spots .
There are also plenty of massage tools available to ease the burden on your hands and help with hard-to-reach places .
+ The calves .
Sit comfortably _ it makes no sense to stress one body part to massage another .
Bend your knee and place your foot flat on the floor .
Shake , squeeze and knead the calf muscle , using one or both hands .
Move up and down the entire calf .
Now mentally divide the calf into two or three long strips .
Pretend your fingers are glued to the skin and use your fingertips or thumbs to rub back and forth across the grain of the muscle .
Rub so that the skin is moving with your fingers _ that ensures you 're working the deeper muscle tissue .
+ The quadriceps .
Shake , squeeze and knead the quads to loosen and relax the muscle .
Then place your hands on the inside and outside of the thigh and roll the quads between them vigorously .
Divide the quads into three or four long strips and use your thumbs or fingers _ keeping them glued to the skin _ to work across the muscle grain .
+ The hand .
Pull and separate the fingers .
Massage the palm of the hand by interlocking your fingers and then working the surface of the palm by applying direct pressure or stroking with the thumb .
+ The upper arm , shoulder and neck .
Use your massaging hand to knead , squeeze and run the length of your chest , shoulders , biceps and triceps on the opposite side .
Clasp your fingers behind the back of your neck .
Pointing your thumbs down toward your back , use them to apply deep strokes to the neck muscles there .
Squeeze the palms together to apply pressure to the back of the neck .
When you find tender spots , stop and hold pressure on them for 30 to 60 seconds .
