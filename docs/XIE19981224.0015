Separatist Threat to Canada Never Go Away : PM
OTTAWA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Canadians will have to deal with the threat of Quebec 's succession as long as Canada exists , Prime Minister Jean Chretien warned .
In year-end TV interviews to be broadcast over the Christmas season , Chretien dismissed suggestions that separatism is fading because of last month election in Quebec , in which the separatist Parti Quebecois ( PQ ) got fewer votes than last time .
As a result , Chretien said he does not expect to fight a third referendum on separation " in the short term . "
But " the problem is that there will always be some people who will promote independence .
It 's been like that since the battle on the Plains of Abraham . "
" It will always be there , " Chretien was quoted as saying by the National Post newspaper Thursday .
On November 's election in Quebec , the prime minister said that he was happy at its results , though he said he would have preferred a victory by the Liberal Party .
Quebecers voted in a " clever " manner by returning the PQ to power without giving the separatist party the mandate to hold another referendum on Quebec 's future within Canada , Chretien noted .
