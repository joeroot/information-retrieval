MEDIA SHOULD STAY OUT OF HOSTAGE SITUATIONS
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By PHIL RECORD c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
When the life of a hostage is at stake , the news media need to butt out .
Unfortunately , some did not do so last month when an armed killer was holed up with a hostage in a service station north of Tampa , Fla.
A Tampa radio station and the St. Petersburg Times drew criticism from law enforcement officers and a journalism ethics scholar for contacting the killer before officers were able to do so .
The actions of the two hurt the credibility of all the news media at a time when journalists can not afford such damage .
You probably read about Hank Earl Carr 's deadly rampage on May 19 .
What you probably did not hear about was the deplorable performance by the radio station and the newspaper , because it drew little national attention .
It should have .
Carr 's rampage began with the slaying of the 4-year-old son of Carr 's girlfriend in their Tampa apartment .
Carr was arrested but managed to slip out of his handcuffs and kill two Tampa homicide detectives who were accompanying him in a car .
In his flight north from Tampa , he killed a state trooper before abandoning his car and taking a 27-year-old female clerk hostage in a service station .
Carr later killed himself after recounting his killing spree and releasing his hostage .
When law enforcement officers tried to contact him by phone at the service station , the line was busy because Carr had already been contacted by Don Richards , news director for radio station WFLA-AM , who kept the fugitive on the line for six minutes .
Amy Ellis , a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times , also managed to get Carr on the line for a brief time .
`` Our negotiators were trying to make contact and ( Carr ) was on the phone with the radio stations that were trying to get a scoop , '' Hernando County Sheriff Thomas Mylander said later .
`` We 're going to have to get some control if they won n't control themselves . ''
Tampa police spokesman Steve Cole said that police finally were forced to call the radio station and ask it to get off the phone .
Richards and his boss defended the call to Carr .
`` My first rule is , do no harm , '' the Times quoted him as saying .
`` And if they ( police ) needed that phone line , we would have lost it very easily .
They can cut in . ''
His boss , WFLA general manager Dave Reinhart , was quoted as saying : `` I 'm proud of him .
First of all , he thought to do it .
Then he handled it in a very admirable manner .
And I believe he was instrumental in the hostage coming to no harm . ''
Their views didn n't convince Bob Steele , director of media ethics at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg .
( The institute owns the St. Petersburg newspaper . ) He issued this statement to The Associated Press after the radio station and newspaper started to draw criticism for their actions :
`` To call the gunman at the gas station at the height of the crisis is totally unjustified and unethical .
It 's a stupid thing to do .
There are lives at stake .
It was clear that the gunman was irrational .
It would be very easy to ask the wrong question or say something that would trigger the gunman to harm the hostage or himself or law enforcement officers . ''
A spokesman for the St. Petersburg newspaper , which ran only the first sentence of Steele 's statement , was somewhat restrained in his response to the criticism .
`` It is a very sensitive situation , '' the newspaper quoted its executive editor , Paul Tash , as saying .
`` Our basic purpose is to get the news and to do that in a way that doesn n't interfere with authorities . ''
Too bad he couldn n't have included an apology , because it is pretty obvious that the calls by the two journalists did interfere with the work of law enforcement officers .
This paper could use a tough ombudsman .
I think such ethical violations are the ultimate responsibility of the publishers and editors of newspapers and the managers and news directors of broadcast stations .
They are the ones who set the ethical standards for their news organizations , and they are the ones responsible for the actions of their staff members .
If the staffers know of the ethical standards of their bosses , they are not apt to violate them .
Steele said that even though Richards handled this particular situation pretty well , things might not go as well the next time .
Contact with those fleeing from police should be left to those trained to negotiate in such situations .
I served with Steele on a Society of Professional Journalists task force that looked into the performance of journalists who covered the 51-day standoff between federal agents and David Koresh and his followers at their compound outside of Waco in 1993 .
The task force was critical of a number of news organizations that got or tried to get phone interviews with Koresh during the early hours of the standoff without the approval of federal negotiators .
At one point , a representative for one of the TV tabloid-like programs tried to get an operator to interrupt a conversation between Koresh and a federal negotiator .
The task force also was critical of a radio talk-show host who broadcast messages of support to Koresh .
We were not critical of KRLD / 1080 AM when that Dallas station broadcast a message from Koresh .
It did so only after consulting with federal authorities .
That is the way to do it .
One of the recommendations issued by the task force stated :
`` Resist the temptation to telephone a gunman or hostage taker .
Journalists generally are not trained in negotiation techniques , and one wrong question or inappropriate word could jeopardize someone 's life .
Furthermore , just calling in could tie up phone lines or otherwise complicate communication efforts of the negotiators . ''
Obviously , the St. Petersburg newspaper and the Tampa radio station had not heard of the recommendation or simply chose to ignore it .
Such performances overshadow the many good things done by the news media in this country every day .
Such performances weaken the foundation on which the First Amendment rests .
As media scholar and author Kathleen Hall Jamieson said in a talk at the University of Pennsylvania in 1996 : `` Journalists are creating the coverage that is going to lead to their own destruction . ''
