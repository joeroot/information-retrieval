NEW YORK _ If there is any act more vicious than the hoax perpetrated against Robert , the tormented hero of Craig Lucas ' tortured new play , `` The Dying Gaul , '' it might be labeled a psychic atrocity .
Robert , played by Tim Hopper , still deep in mourning over his dead lover Malcolm , takes up with Jeffrey ( Tony Goldwyn ) , a bisexual Hollywood producer married to Elaine ( Linda Emond ) , who is aware of Jeffrey 's infidelity and is desperate to understand the nature of his passion .
With her trusty laptop , she enters the world of Internet chat rooms posing as a gay man and , wouldn n't you know it , there she encounters the same Robert , a fellow seeker of online liaisons .
What follows is unregenerate cruelty : In her male guise ( and having , by virtue of another unlikely complication , broken into the office of Robert 's psychiatrist and memorized his notes ) , Elaine convinces Robert that she is the dead Malcolm , floating around in his computer software .
Do you believe in cyberghosts ?
Lucas , who in `` Prelude to a Kiss '' displayed a lyrical gift for stories blending romance and the occult , walks a decidedly darker path in `` The Dying Gaul , '' a minor tantrum of a play about the kind of black grief that can mutate into bottomless rage .
Still , this plot-driven drama at the Vineyard Theater does at times achieve a disquieting creepiness , thanks to the surehanded direction of Mark Brokaw and a first-rate cast , led by Ms. Emond and Hopper , that manages to sustain the dramatic tension , even when compassion for these harsh characters is too much to expect .
`` Prelude to a Kiss '' took flight on the out-of-body energy unleashed in the meeting of two pairs of lips ; Lucas held you with the pure poetry of wish fulfillment .
`` The Dying Gaul '' is the somber epilogue to a love foreshortened by death .
Oddly enough , it 's a much harder piece to take seriously .
Whimsy is supplanted here by mechanical plot-twisting ; Jeffrey and Elaine , for instance , just happen to grow a rare plant with a fast-acting poison in their garden that Robert just happens to recognize in a moment of blinding terror .
It 's a play that forces you , as with a clumsy thriller , to be stingy with your credulity .
The exercise proves as joyless as an autopsy .
The motif of `` The Dying Gaul '' is loss , as it is observed from neutral corners , whether by Robert 's psychiatrist , Foss ( Robert Emmet Lunney ) , trying to help Robert over Malcolm 's death ; by Elaine , absorbing Robert 's suffering while surfing the Net ; and even by Robert , a writer whose screenplay about his relationship with Malcolm , `` The Dying Gaul , '' is named for the Greek sculpture of the Gallic warrior , frozen in pain and defeat .
Robert , played by Hopper with an air of abject despair bordering on panic , submits `` The Dying Gaul '' script to Jeffrey , a hotshot-producer type familiar from a hundred other plays .
Goldwyn , himself a member of a famous film-producing family ( and a last-minute substitute for Cotter Smith , who was forced to drop out after an injury ) , is fine in this obviously duplicitous Hollywood role , in which he woos Robert while sealing deals on his cell phone .
The play inhabits a world of gorgeous surfaces _ Allen Moyer 's modern , sand-colored set of sliding screens is a little bit of Zen in and around Los Angeles _ that is not the least bit inviting .
When Jeffrey , in a hubristic act worthy of his profession , brings Robert home to meet Elaine , an ethereal menage a trois is enjoined .
Ms. Emond brings a wonderful composure to the wronged Elaine that almost makes her terrible trick on Robert , more terrible by far than anything he does to her , seem a reasonable revenge .
( STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
The scenes in which Robert and Elaine communicate by computer _ scenes that carry echoes of `` Closer , '' a play by Patrick Marber about the hollow lives of four Londoners , that transferred to the West End after a sold-out run at the National Theater last fall _ are easily the most engrossing and disturbing in `` The Dying Gaul . ''
`` I am spirit without body _ your guardian , '' Elaine says , chipping away at Robert 's defenses until he reveals more about his love , and his lovers , than is good for either of them .
Lucas , unfortunately , is not very convincing in the resolution of this act of manipulation , or in the final brinkmanship in the marriage of Jeffrey and Elaine .
Out of all these vacant relationships , Robert and Jeffrey , Jeffrey and Elaine , Elaine and Robert , comes a hostile conclusion that makes Robert seem smaller and more embittered than one could possibly have been prepared for .
It makes for a play of extreme pessimism , a hope-dashing experience that suggests that in the face of such desolation , the remedy is not applause but heavy sedation .
