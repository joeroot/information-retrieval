Genes of Ancient Chinese Extracted
ZHENGZHOU , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese and Japanese geneticists today extracted some DNA samples from ancient Chinese who lived some 3,000 years ago and whose remains were excavated in Henan Province .
The gene samples were collected from the teeth of more than 100 people who lived in the Yin Dynasty , and this is considered helpful for the study of the evolution of human genes and the migrations of ancient people .
Tang Biaoxian , an archeologist with the Archeological Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) , said that a large number of bones have been unearthed in the burial grounds of the ancient Yin people .
He said that artifacts including a palace , workshops , inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells , bronze ware and jade articles also suggest that this Bronze Age civilization was quite developed in Anyang , capital of the Yin Dynasty , which lasted about 270 years .
However , there are still many mysteries concerning the remains of the Yin Dynasty , Tang said .
Dr. Jin Feng of the Genetics Research Institute of the CASS , said that the gene samples will be used for statistical analysis using a sophisticated computer system , and the data will be compared with the genetic makeup of modern humans .
The remains of the Yin Dynasty were first discovered in the city of Anyang in 1928 , already renowned for its ancient inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells .
