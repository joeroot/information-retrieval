Mozambique to Privatize Port , Railways Co.
MAPUTO , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Mozambique will , at all costs , privatize the Ports and Railways Company of Mozambique , but be very careful regarding the treatment of the company 's workers , a senior official said here Wednesday .
Paulo Muxanga , Minister of Transportation and Communications made the commitment when answering questions in parliament .
Muxanga said a cooperation partner has offered 30 million U.S. Dollars for the company , on condition that all the workers be laid off after compensation , which the minister said is unacceptable .
The government hoped that all the workers who may be affected in the restructuring can get another job , if not in the ports and railways company , Muxanga said .
Privatization is the only way to modernize the company , which brought in about 110 million U.S. Dollars for the government in 1997 , and it is expected to triple the revenues after privatization , the minister said .
About 90 million Dollars are needed for the restructuring and resettlement of the company 's workers .
