TOUGH NEW CUNY STANDARDS ARE ATTACKED AT YORK
( ja ) By WILLIAM H. HONAN c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ While graduates of York College in Queens basked in sunshine and congratulations at their commencement , Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 's policies took a drubbing Monday .
The mayor did not attend the event .
What made the occasion contentious was the vote last Tuesday by the CUNY board of trustees , at the mayor 's urging , to discontinue remedial classes at the 11 senior colleges in the system , including York .
They also voted to exclude any student who has not passed placement tests in reading , writing and mathematics .
The plan is scheduled to be phased in over three years , beginning in September 1999 .
Alfred Curtis Jr. , a trustee who has supported the campaign to phase out remedial courses , was drowned out by boos and catcalls Monday morning at York , in Jamaica , as he tried to express greetings from fellow trustees .
Many graduates rose to their feet , shaking their fists and pumping placards with slogans like , `` Education Is a Right , Not a Favor . ''
Critics say the new policy will prevent thousands of students from entering college .
Giuliani and other supporters have said that the policy will raise academic standards .
The demonstration at York College 's 28th commencement ceremony was not wholly spontaneous .
Students distributed cards urging graduates to protest when Curtis rose to speak .
Opposition to the plan was also raised by the valedictorian , Ingrid Amorini , in her address to the 1,001 graduates .
Ms. Amorini of East Elmhurst , Queens , a native of Argentina , began by telling of the difficulties she encountered as a single parent who also cared for her younger brother , who is severely retarded .
She said that after entering York College in 1993 , she failed the English writing test .
Then Ms. Amorini brought the graduates to their feet applauding when she said , `` York College gave me the necessary remedial course , which allowed me to pass the written English exam the second time I took it .
I got straight A 's that first semester and all the subsequent 148 credits .
All I needed was a chance . ''
Ms. Amorini invited all graduates who had taken at least one remedial course to stand .
Almost half of the students rose , cheering .
The new admissions plan was also criticized by the commencement speaker , John Hope Franklin , an emeritus professor of history at Duke University and chairman of the advisory board of One America , President Clinton 's committee on race relations .
Franklin began by urging the graduates `` not to feel inferior or inadequate because you took a remedial course . ''
There should be no more stigma attached to that experience , he contended , than to an immigrant 's need for language training , or , for that matter , to a student who wants to learn how to speak Italian .
He urged the graduates to teach as well as to take remedial courses .
Franklin recalled that when he was a graduate student at Harvard University , he encountered a middle-aged man who could neither read nor write .
For eight months , he said , he taught the man for one hour a day .
`` Nothing I learned at Harvard , '' he said , `` was more important and rewarding to me than teaching a grown man how to read and write . ''
