SPORTS COLUMN : FROM RENAISSANCE TO RECKONING , FOR BOTH JETS AND GIANTS
( nk ) By WILLIAM C. RHODEN c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
In the past , when the Jets and Giants have played each other the games often had a set of meanings and implications , carried certain overtones : Giants fans ' condescension , Jets fans ' feelings of inadequacy .
This season , when they meet on Aug. 20 at Giants Stadium , the game will be played minus the overtones .
Nothing will be on the line besides temporary bragging rights and momentum ; there will be none of the inferior-superior dichotomies of the past .
This time it will just be two contending teams , each in the midst of a renaissance , doing a little muscle flexing as they prepare to take the next step .
Last season , the Giants went from mediocrity to a division championship and the Jets went from 1 - 15 to 9 - 7 , barely missing the playoffs .
On Thursday , the Jets roughed up the Philadelphia Eagles in their exhibition opener , 29 - 15 .
Last season at this time , with so much focus being placed on changing the team 's attitude , the Jets always seemed to be groping along .
On Thursday , they moved with authority and even confidence .
The Giants looked commanding in their opener on Saturday , a 24 - 17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals .
`` Last year everything was new for us , '' cornerback Jason Sehorn said after the game .
`` We started out 1 - 3 , we didn n't grasp it that quickly .
This year we 're not installing , we 're just updating .
It 's nice to see we didn n't digress . ''
The difficult part for the Jets and Giants is that the level of expectation surrounding both teams has skyrocketed .
Giants fans are looking for a trip to _ or near _ the Super Bowl ; Jets fans are looking for the team to make the playoffs for the second time since 1986 , and many are holding out hope for a division title .
In the wake of the Giants ' victory over the Bengals , and in the midst of the general euphoria surrounding their prospects , people are saying that the Giants are beginning where they left off last season .
Anyone who remembers how last season ended knows that is not exactly true .
The Giants were unexpectedly pushed out of the playoffs by a sudden , horrific jolt : The Minnesota Vikings scored 10 points in the game 's last 90 seconds and upset the Giants , 23 - 22 .
Players say musings and reflections about past losses are for fans and writers ; they say that players don n't care .
They may not , but coaches do .
For all of the success and the coach of the year honors , you can n't tell me that the Giants ' Jim Fassell doesn n't remember that heart-rending feeling last December .
Or how he went home after the Minnesota game and woke up three times in the morning , preparing to go back to work _ and there was no work to go back to .
Fassell is not likely to have forgotten the image of the Giants fighting among themselves on the field in the third quarter as the dream began to unravel .
Or the snapshot of Minnesota 's Randall Cunningham hitting Jake Reed with a late touchdown pass in the swirling snow .
`` That 's over , '' Sehorn said .
`` I don n't live in the past , in anything in life : football or nonfootball .
When it 's in the past it 's in the past and you move on . ''
Football players may not live in the past , but they live in denial ; the ever-present violence of their game makes it necessary .
Attention is always tightly focused on the next game .
Players have the luxury of forgetting ; nightmares aren n't really nightmares , but mere inconveniences that result in a loss here and there .
Nothing life-threatening : busted play , blown coverage , missed tackle .
Occasionally reality pops up and intrudes , reminds players of their fragile nature .
Last week tests revealed that Corey Miller , the Giants linebacker , had a herniated disc in his neck and would miss the season , and may have to retire .
Last year Ike Hilliard , the Giants ' rookie receiver , injured his neck in September in only his second pro game and missed the rest of the season .
It 's all part of the seasonal ebb and flow .
Miller leaves , Hilliard returns .
Sudden injuries , sudden losses _ block them out .
The constant has to be winning .
What 's important for the Jets and the Giants is fulfilling their potential , and meeting expectations .
This is a new season with high hopes and clean slates .
The novelty phase is over .
`` The time of slipping past people and sneaking up on people is over , '' Sehorn said .
`` Teams are going to be waiting .
People expect us to win ; we expect us to win . ''
