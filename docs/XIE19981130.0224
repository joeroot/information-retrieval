Chilean FM to Fly to Spain for Pinochet 's Case
LONDON , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza is to fly to Spain Monday in his continuing bid to stop the extradition of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet from the United Kingdom .
Insulza , who came to London specially for Pinochet 's case , still maintains the 83-year-old general should be allowed to fly home to face justice there .
The foreign minister said his hope is to persuade the Spanish authorities to drop their extradition request .
His three-day-long effort in London to stop the extradition proceeding has not been fruitful .
UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook assured Insulza in their talks that the extradition process would keep going as scheduled .
Earlier Sunday , The Observer and The Sunday Times reported that British ministers and Insulza nearly reached a deal to allow Pinochet to fly back home to face justice in Chile .
But the UK government and Insulza said later that no deal was reached .
