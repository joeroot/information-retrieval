IFC to Hold Qinghai 's Qingtai Trust and Investment Company
XINING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The Qinghai provincial government has approved the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) 's holding plan for the Qingtai Trust and Investment Company , the province 's only non-banking institution approved by the State Council .
The plan is yet to be granted approval by the People 's Bank of China , the central bank .
A group of IFC 's senior officials toured the northwestern province recently to investigate the local investment environment and the possibility of IFC 's holding of the Qinghai company .
Qingtai was set up in 1997 with a registered capital of 167 million yuan .
Its shareholders include several local large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises .
Dr. Karl Wakdkirch , an official with the Germany-based DGE , said that IFC 's holding of the Qinghai company is intended to develop local natural resources .
The IFC , a member of the World Bank Group , had approved 33 projects in China by June 1997 , in which it invested nearly 2.8 billion U.S. dollars .
