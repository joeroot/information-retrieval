54 Dead , 43 Still Missing in Philippine Ship Sinking
MANILA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Philippine Navy and Coast Guard rescue vessels on Monday intensified their search in the Manila Bay area for 43 people still missing in last Friday 's sinking of an inter-island ship carrying 454 people .
A coast guard ship went to the area at 5 a.m. Monday to resume its search and rescue operation for the missing passengers in the sinking of M/V Princess of the Orient .
Three more dead bodies were recovered by frogmen Monday along the shorelines of Cavite province near Manila , bringing to 54 the death toll from the sea disaster .
The Coast Guard listed 357 rescued , leaving 43 still missing in the worst sea tragedy since 1994 when an inter-island ship sank near the central Philippines , killing 113 people .
The Board of Marine Inquiry will immediately start the investigation as soon as the rescue operation is completed .
Rescuers said hopes to find more survivors grow dimmer , considering that the ship sank three days ago .
However , Navy and Coast Guard ships continue their search between the waters of the provinces of Cavite and Batangas .
All the 357 rescued and the 54 fatalities were found drifting at sea near Fortune Island , where the ship sank on its way from Manila toward southern Cebu city Friday night , or along the shorelines of Cavite .
Frogmen from the Navy and Coast Guard have been deployed to retrieve bodies that have been drifted ashore .
The ill-fated ship went down 360 fathoms deep at the height of typhoon Gading which hit the country last week .
The 13,734-ton Princess of the Orient is the largest inter-island ship in the country before it capsized .
Captain Isrom Mahilum , the ship 's skipper , was reported to be alive but this could not be confirmed .
The investigation on why the ship sank despite its huge size will be the focus of a marine board inquiry .
Based on the passenger manifest , there were only 454 people , including 102 crew members on board when the ship sank at the mouth of the Manila Bay .
The vessel was authorized to carry more than 3,000 passengers .
There are reports that the ship was carrying huge cargoes that included 15 vehicles and 66 containers .
Investigators are expected to look into this angle whether there was any overloading of cargoes .
Survivors recounted that the sinking happened so fast considering that the ship did not sustain any damage despite being battered by big waves .
