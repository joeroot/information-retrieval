_ & HT ; WHY AMERICA WILL REMAIN NO .
1 By MORTIMER B. ZUCKERMAN & HT ; ( 1,500 words ) EDITORS : For the opposing view , see Paul Krugman 's `` America the Boastful '' _ BC-CON-AMERICA-IS-NOT-TOPS .
& HT ; The American economy is in the eighth year of sustained growth that transcends the `` German miracle '' and the `` Japanese miracle '' of earlier decades .
America had the 20th century .
It will also have the 21st .
& HT ; Mortimer B. Zuckerman is chairman and editor-in-chief of U.S. News and World Report , publisher of The New York Daily News , and chairman of Boston Properties .
& HT ; ( slugged : BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-TOPS-NYTSF ) & HT ; & HT ; AMERICA THE BOASTFUL By PAUL KRUGMAN c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine
( 1,500 words ) EDITORS : For the opposing view , see Mortimer Zuckerman 's `` America Will Remain No. 1 '' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS - TOPS .
The current sense that the United States is on top of the world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few good years here and a few bad years elsewhere .
In no sense is the United States on the verge of crisis .
But future historians will not record that the 21st century belonged to America .
& UR ; Paul Krugman is professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

& UR ; AMERICANIZING ASIA ?
& LR ; & QL ; & UR ; By DONALD K. EMMERSON & LR ; & QC ;
( 1,300 words ) It is presumptuous to think the Asian financial crisis foretells Asian acceptance of American ways .
The Asian economies holding up the best may be those with the most political freedom , but the real key may be competent government .
East Asia is changing , but not Americanizing .
& UR ; Donald K. Emmerson is professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and editor of `` Indonesia Beyond Suharto : Polity , Economy , Society , '' forthcoming in 1998 .

( slugged : BC-ASIA-NEEDS-HELP-NYTSF )
& UR ; JAPAN IS IN DENIAL & LR ; & QL ; & UR ; By EDWARD J. LINCOLN & LR ; & QC ;
( 1,400 words ) Tokyo 's economic sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international reverberations .
Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal behavior .
Yet the impulse to reform is weak , and those who believe Japan will adopt an American economic model are mistaken .
& UR ; Edward J. Lincoln is a Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution .
& LR ;
( slugged : BC-JAPAN-DECLINE-NYTSF )
& UR ; FRANCE IS IN A BAD MOOD & LR ; & QL ; & UR ; By DOMINIQUE MOISI & LR ; & QC ;
( 1,450 words ) The French always seem to be opposing the United states on some issue or another .
Why is France so difficult to deal with ?
It is , quite simply , in a bad mood , unsure of its place and status in a new world .
The French are jealous of America , which seems to run the world ; afraid of globalization ; and ambivalent about European unity .
& UR ; Dominique Moisi is deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations and editor in chief of Politique Etrangere .

& UR ; A THREE-PART SERIES : CHAOS IN RUSSIA & LR ; & QL ; & UR ; By Grigory Yavlinsky _
Part I : & UR ; RUSSIA 'S ROBBER BARON SOCIETY & LR ; _ The robber barons are stifling their homeland 's economic growth by stealing from Russia and investing abroad .
( slugged : BC-RUSSIA-ROBBER - BARONS-NYTSF )
Part II : & UR ; FROM DUMA FISTFIGHTS TO FIRINGS , RUSSIA ISN ' T DEMOCRATIC & LR ; _ As Boris Yeltsin 's cabinet firings show , Russia 's system of checks and balances is underdeveloped , leaving the country prone to the whims of a mercurial chief executive .
( slugged : BC-RUSSIA-NOT-DEMOCRATIC-NYTSF )
Part III : & UR ; RUSSIA : WHAT IS TO BE DONE ?
& LR ; _ A new set of rules must be established .
The power of oil and gas tycoons must be curtailed .
The law making Duma members immune from prosecution should be repealed .
The large number of criminals running for Duma seats to gain immunity is repulsive .
