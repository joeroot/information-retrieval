JAKARTA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The Badminton Association of Indonesia ( PBSI ) plans to reshuffle its national players as it prepares to win gold medals at the 2000 Olympics Games in Sydney , PBSI secretary general Leo Chandra Wiranata said on Wednesday .
Wiranata said the badminton body would decide after the first two world grand prix tournaments of the season .
" Players who fail to perform commendably during the two outings will have to leave the training center .
We will then bring in new talent from the provinces to take their places , " Wiranata was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying .
He said underachieving coaches would also receive their marching orders .
Wiranata said PBSI would consult coaches and provincial officials during the reshuffle .
" They are expected to advise us which shuttlers are still prospects , " he said .
