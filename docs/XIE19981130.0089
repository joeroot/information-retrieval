Nigeria Raises Alarm over Population Growth
LAGOS , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Nigeria 's population is likely to increase from 108 million at present to 178 million in another 25 years if unchecked , a senior Nigerian official said .
Chairman of National Population Commission ( NPC ) Lt. General Chris Ugokwe was delivering a lecture entitled " The Challenge of Population and Environment in the Next Millennium " , according to a This Day report Monday .
He told a workshop organized by the National Council on Population and Environmental Activities ( NCPEA ) at the weekend that the population of Nigeria had grown at an annual growth rate of about 2.83 percent , slightly more than double the world average rate of 1.4 percent .
According to him , the implication of this rapid population growth is the shortage of water and arable land , and it also results in the low per capita income which stands at about 283 U.S. Dollars in this West African country .
The NPC chief disclosed that the high rate of population growth in Nigeria 's urban centers was largely responsible for over-crowding , traffic congestion , pollution from vehicle emissions and solid waste management .
He suggested population stabilization measures involving the education of the feminine gender as a counter-strategy to keep the nation 's population growth trends in check .
" Therefore , detrimental impact on the environment would , in many contexts , be best reduced by a combined strategy of slowing down population growth , rationalizing population distribution , alleviating poverty ... , " he stressed .
The poverty eradication scheme , Ugokwe stated , should involve a program package with special focus on girls and women which will help reduce fertility .
On the same occasion , NCPEA National President Prince Juli Adelusi-Adeluyi pledged the support of his organization to the Nigerian government in its efforts of population stabilization .
