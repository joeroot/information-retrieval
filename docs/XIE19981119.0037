EU Proposes Legal Framework on Electronic Commerce
Brussels , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The European Union ( EU ) said here on Wednesday that EU Commission has put forward a proposal for a directive to set up a coherent legal framework for the development of electronic commerce within the Union 's single market .
The proposed directive would ensure that information society services benefit from the single market principles of free movement of services and freedom of establishment and could provide their services throughou the 15 EU states if they comply with the law in their country of origin .
The commission said such services are defined as those provided normally against remuneration , at a distance , by electronic means and in response to the individual request of a consumer .
The proposed directive would establish specific harmonized rules only in those areas strictly necessary to ensure that businesses and citizens could supply and receive information society services throughout the EU , irrespective of frontiers .
These areas , the commission said , include definition of where operators are established , electronic contracts , liability of intermediaries , dispute settlement and role of national authorities .
In other areas , the directive would build on existing EU instruments which provide for harmonization or on mutual recognition of national laws .
And the directive would apply only to service providers established within the EU and not those established outside , the EU proposal said .
