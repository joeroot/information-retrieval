Overseas Investment Up in Shanghai
SHANGHAI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Investment in Shanghai from the European Union and the United States increased nearly three times in January-August period of this year over the same period last year , according to local sources .
In the first eight months of this year , investment from Asian countries dropped dramatically due to the Asian financial crisis , however , total contracted overseas investment grew by one-fourth , reaching 4.77 billion U.S. dollars which already exceeded this year 's target of 4 billion U.S. dollars set by the Shanghai Municipal People 's Government .
Investment from E.U .
and U.S. multinational companies was responsible for this rise , as the U.S. 's Kodak added 1.6 billion U.S. dollars to its investment in Shanghai and the German company Krupp & AMP ; Thyssen topped all foreign companies this year in joint-venture investment in Shanghai .
Another change in this year 's foreign investment in the city was the flow of funds into the industrial sector rather than into real estate as in the past .
Shanghai 's Pudong New Area still remains the hot spot for overseas investment .
In the first eight months , it absorbed 2.69 billion U.S. dollars in contracted overseas investment , a seven - fold increase over the same period last year .
Recently , Shanghai has created a package plan for inviting investment from both at home and abroad .
This 4 billion U.S. dollars plan covers 168 major projects including digital telecommunications , new medicines , new materials , environmental protection and green products .
