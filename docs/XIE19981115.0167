Villa Beats Southampton in English Premier League
LONDON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Three goals from Dion Dublin helped Aston Villa beat Southampton 4 - 1 in the English Premier League on Saturday .
With the win , leaders Villa had three points clear of Manchester United at the top of the standings .
The result also gave Villa , unbeaten in 12 league matches , their best ever start to a league season .
Paul Scholes scored twice as Manchester United leapfrogged Arsenal into second place with a 3 - 2 win at home to a fighting Blackburn Rovers side which was reduced to 10 men when captain Tim Sherwood was sent off in the 47th minute .
Blackburn scored both their goals after Sherwood had gone off , coming back from 3 - 0 down .
Champions Arsenal , hammered 5 - 0 by Chelsea in their midweek League Cup clash , rang the changes for the visit of their former manager George Graham with north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur , but the match ended goalless .
Arsenal , whose fans jeered Graham as a " Judas " before the kickoff , dropped to third and a point behind United .
Former France coach Gerard Houllier , who took sole charge as manager of Liverpool on Friday after the departure of co-manager Roy Evans , watched his side take the lead on his full debut and then slump 3 - 1 at Anfield to Graham 's former club Leeds .
