SMALL-CAP STOCKS PERK UP AFTER MARKET 'S MELTDOWN
By MARK VEVERKA c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle Are small-cap stocks finally making their long-awaited move ?
For more than a year now , market gurus have been predicting that the little guys were destined to rally .
After all , the only stocks out there that seem cheap by any rational measure ( not that sanity seems to matter anymore ) are the small caps .
Yet for the most part , they 've been clobbered while the big caps continue to dominate what might be the twilight of this current bull-run .
Small caps , by the way , are generally considered stocks with market-capitalizations ( common shares multiplied by per-share price ) of less than $ 1 billion .
However , there was a micro-trend , if you will , late last week that caught the attention of some professional stock-pickers .
Small caps perked to life , bouncing back sprightly from Tuesday 's market meltdown .
( In case you were too wrapped up in the Lewinsky testimony to notice , the Dow dropped 299 points that day . )
On Thursday and Friday , the Russell 2000 index , which is an often-cited barometer of small-stock performance , jumped 8 points and 11 points respectively .
The index closed Friday at 415.80 , up 4.3 percent from Wednesday 's close , which was a 52-week low .
`` We 've had a great two days .
I 'm amazed at the way these stocks have come back , '' says James Broadfoot , chief investment officer of Ivy Management in Boca Raton , Fla.
Of course , two days doesn n't make a rally .
But it 's worth noting because during past corrections , Broadfoot says , small caps were hammered with the rest of the stock market but usually remained beaten down long after the large caps started to rebound .
`` I would have expected ( small caps ) to go down with the broader market and stay down .
But here you have the small stocks outperforming , '' says Broadfoot , who literally wrote the book on investing in emerging growth stocks .
`` That has not been the case for the past couple of years , '' he says .
To be sure , it 's nearly impossible to tell if small caps are really going to have their day in the sun .
Institutional investors tend to shy from them because the big-cap , name-brand stocks have treated them so generously in recent years .
What 's more , the Russell 2000 is still trading down 23 percent from its 52-week high of 491.41 in April .
And 1998 certainly doesn n't rank as a banner year for the index .
Still , if the small caps are ever going to rally , they 'll have to make their move sooner or later .
Despite the recent uptick , many pros still think it will be later .
NET NUTTINESS
Speaking of stock insanity , let 's talk about Internet valuations .
Of course , the mere mention of the two words ( Internet and valuation ) in a single sentence should qualify the guilty party for a free one-way ticket to the state mental institution in Napa .
Nevertheless , at the risk of engaging in a mentally unhealthy exercise , some new data on Web site activity may be worth a gander .
There are only a couple of semi-meaningful measurements that analysts use in their economic models for Net stocks : revenues and site traffic .
And RelevantKnowledge , an online measurement firm in Atlanta , has released its latest results telling which online outfits are attracting the most eyeballs .
To little surprise , Yahoo , AOL and Microsoft continued to be ranked 1 - 2-3 in June , attracting a total of 66.5 million unique visitors ( meaning an individual can be counted only once per site ) over the age of 12 .
In the search engine category , Excite , Infoseek and Lycos continued to rank second , third and fourth behind Yahoo .
Meanwhile , online community GeoCities was the sixth most-visited Internet portal , drawing 14.3 million visitors in July .
Once again , that showing underscores that it is among the last online name brands to go public .
( Its offering is expected this week . )
Coming on hard was online community Xoom of San Francisco .
The GeoCities rival was listed as the 17th most-visited site in July with 4.6 million eyeballs , up impressively from 21st in June .
What 's more , Xoom wasn n't even in the top 50 five months ago , according to a company spokesman .
At that rate , I suppose they 'll be going public faster than you can say `` projected revenues . ''
