& HT ; Jets-Pats rivalry full of bad blood & HT ; By Len Pasquarelli & HT ; c.1998 Cox News Service
ATLANTA _ As he bounded toward the locker room after the New York Jets ' division-clinching victory last Saturday afternoon , coach Bill Parcells put his arm around the shoulder of Curtis Martin and whispered sweet somethings in the tailback 's ear .
`` Just remember , '' Parcells said , `` that we 're not finished yet . ''
Parcells was referring to his desire for a third Super Bowl championship .
But given that this week 's NFL schedule features `` Tuna Bowl IV '' _ the fourth matchup of the Jets and Patriots since Parcells acrimoniously left New England after the 1996 season _ his cautionary reminder might have suggested a more immediate urgency .
Chances are that Martin , filched from the Patriots as a transition free agent and one of several former New England players on the Jets roster , won n't require much prodding to get ready for the latest edition of one of the league 's best rivalries .
Even though the Jets have secured a first-round playoff bye , they can scuttle the Patriots ' chances for a wild-card game at home .
`` That 's motivation enough for me , '' Martin said .
The New England-New York matchup is the only one in NFL history in which each coach previously led the opposite team .
Patriots coach Pete Carroll is 1 - 2 against Parcells and is anxious to even the score .
As they have for most of the second half of the season , the Patriots go into the game with several starters out with injuries .
Most notable is quarterback Drew Bledsoe .
But because Parcells seems to get inside his head so easily , Bledsoe 's fractured index finger might be a break for New England .
The rest of the NFL `` bests '' for this weekend :
_ Upset opportunity : The New Orleans Saints are playing for pride and 1999 jobs .
Those two elements , and the fear that Mike Ditka indeed is coming back next season , could be enough to keep things close in the game against Buffalo .
The New Orleans defense will stomp Doug Flutie and _ if Kerry Collins doesn n't totally screw things up on the offensive side _ spearhead a moral victory .
_ Individual matchup : The Miami defense , arguably the quickest unit in the league , held Denver tailback Terrell Davis to 29 yards on 16 carries Monday night .
Six days later , it encounters Jamal Anderson , who needs only 16 rushes to break James Wilder 's season record for carries .
Sixteen carries probably will be 16 collisions with middle linebacker Zach Thomas .
Anderson and Thomas will be chomping aspirin after this one .
_ Fantasy play : Imagine how excited St. Louis players were to hear team president John Shaw 's decision to bring back coach Dick Vermeil in ' 99 .
Think they 're going to be high for the 49 ers , a team that 's defeated them 16 times in a row ?
Think again , and book San Francisco tailback Garrison Hearst for about 150 yards and two touchdowns .
_ Grudge match : Nothing tops Parcells vs. the Patriots , but there 's plenty of history in the Green Bay-Chicago rivalry .
The Bears played the Packers tough the first meeting of the season , but Brett Favre is getting his playoff face on .
_ Division game : The bleeding Dallas Cowboys can become the first NFC East franchise to get through division play undefeated and untied .
With the secondary decimated , it will be tougher than expected against a suddenly resuscitated Redskins team that has won six of its last eight games .
