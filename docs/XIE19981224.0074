China 's Petrochemical Sector Profitable
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The China National Petrochemical Corp ( Sinopec ) will generate 26.5 billion yuan in profits and taxes this year despite unfavorable factors .
According to Sinopec president Li Yizhong , China 's petrochemical industry has been seriously affected by the Asian financial crisis and the glut oil markets worldwide .
To make it worse , the domestic demand for crude oil and refined oil products was sluggish and smuggling rampant .
In view of this , China has reduced imports of crude oil and related products , increased the domestic supply for foreign-funded enterprises and severely cracked down on oil smuggling , effectively reducing the effects of falling oil prices .
The official said that China has also tightened macro-control over crude oil and related products markets and promoted the rational distribution of the crude oil and related products .
Meanwhile , China has accelerated reform of the oil circulation and pricing systems and reorganized the China National Petroleum Corp ( CNPC ) and the China National Petrochemical Corp ( Sinopec ) .
Under the new oil system , China has combined upstream and downstream production , in addition to integrating internal and external trade .
Moreover , through technological advances and the transformation of the operational mechanisms , Sinopec has effectively enhanced its economic efficiency and reduced production costs .
