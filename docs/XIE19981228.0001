Poverty Still a Challenge to Vietnam
HANOI , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Poverty alleviation campaigns launched by Vietnam 's government have had little effect on poor households and have not yet created a movement to fight poverty at the grassroots level , Deputy Minister of Labor , War Invalids and Social Welfare Dam Huu Dac was quoted as saying by Vietnam News Agency ( VNA ) Sunday .
About one-third of Vietnamese live in poverty , down from 70 percent in 1980 and 50 percent in 1993 , a World Bank ( WB ) report said at the consultative group meeting on earlier December in Paris .
The report also highlighted challenges facing Vietnam that may hinder efforts to reduce poverty by an additional 10 percent in 1999 , a goal set by the 8th party congress .
The first challenge is a dramatic fall in economic growth which is expected to continue in 1999 .
Continuing decline in employment in industrial and agricultural areas accompanied by sharp cuts in state spending is another challenge .
VNA said the government estimates unemployment rate at six percent in Hanoi but it is believed to be as high as eight percent .
Meanwhile , the income gap between city dwellers and rural people continues to widen .
City dwellers earned five times as much as rural people in 1990 - eight times in 1997 .
The biggest challenge is natural disasters .
Prolonged drought in 1997 - 1998 and three tropical storms in November striking provinces on the central highlands and the central coast put more than one million people at risk of famine .
People in the Mekong Delta are still struggling to rebuild their lives in the wake of typhoon Lynda in November 1997 .
Three quarters of the poor live off agriculture , forestry and fishing , generating average income of about 2 million VN dong ( one U.S. dollar equals to 13,890 VN dong ) per capita yearly , and even 1 million VN dong in some places .
According to VNA , many policy makers said it is important to link poverty alleviation efforts with economic growth and social justice .
Internal resources and the potential of each province should be released and brought into full play through practical programs .
Under the national strategy for poverty alleviation up to the years 2000 and 2010 , the Vietnamese government pledges to invest more in building rural infrastructure and facilities with funding drawn from all resources .
