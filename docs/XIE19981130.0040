China Announces 12-Year Program of AIDS Control
BEIJING , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- China aims to keep its HIV infection level under 1.5 million people by the year 2010 , while ending the transmission of HIV through blood transfusions and intravenous drug use , according to the latest national AIDS-control program .
The program , with approval from the State Council , China 's cabinet , will direct the country 's fight against HIV / AIDS that has preyed upon over 300,000 Chinese so far .
The number of people infected by the human immuno deficiency virus ( HIV ) , which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , may increase to 1.2 million in China by the year 2000 .
The government and AIDS experts blame the critical situation on cross-border transmission of HIV in southwestern areas bordering other countries , where there is a very large floating population , uncontrolled drug use , and rampant prostitution .
The Medium - and Long-term Program of AIDS Prevention and Control ( 1998 - 2010 ) has determined that the annual increase rate of the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) should be under 15 percent by 2002 , compared with 16 percent now .
Rapid growth of STD incidence has sounded an alarm bell for AIDS control in China , even though the majority of current HIV carriers were infected by sharing contaminated needles .
The country reported 460,000 STD cases last year , a rise of nearly 16 percent over 1996 .
But experts fear that the true figure may be five to ten times that , because most patients turn to private or unauthorized clinics in order to remain anonymous , and thus fail to be counted .
In order to stir public awareness of disease prevention , the program includes public information and educational campaigns which cover 80 percent of the people considered to be at high risk , such as prostitutes and drug users , as well as 70 percent of urban dwellers and 40 percent of rural residents .
AIDS and STD education will be carried out among all students at institutions of higher education , secondary schools and vocational schools .
Drug rehabilitation centers , jails and special schools for reeducation through labor will also hold related activities .
" Places of entertainment or those with large flows of changing populations , as well as work units whose personnel often go abroad , should prepare educational material on AIDS , " said an outline of the program provided to Xinhua today by the Ministry of Health .
A surveillance network will be set up throughout the country by 2005 composed of a national reference laboratory , some 30 provincial-level AIDS labs , and local institutions which are able to conduct regular HIV checks .
Hospitals able to offer standard treatment , and nursing and counseling services for HIV carriers and AIDS patients will be established in major cities and AIDS-stricken areas .
Domestic researchers working on anti-HIV drugs and vaccines will face a challenging task in the coming decade , as some breakthroughs are expected to be made in this field .
