Angolan Minister Denies Possible Govt Attack
LUANDA , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Angolan Deputy Minister of Territorial Administration Higino Carneiro denied once again on Wednesday the press reports that government troops are poised to launch large-scale attacks on UNITA controlled Andulo and Bailundo cities in central Angola .
Meanwhile , however , he noted that " nothing happens there will be surprising , because ( government ) armed forces are determined to fight against any criminals sabotaging national order . "
The Angola News Agency reported Wednesday that the opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) forces have recently occupied some areas in central Angola , bringing about much tension in the region .
Joao de Matos , chief of the general staff of Angolan armed forces , went to Hambo Province , central Angola , Tuesday afternoon to inspect the military situation in the area .
Also on Tuesday , Carneiro , who attended a meeting of the joint committee of Angola peace process called by U.N. special envoy to Angola Issa Diallo , said the government has been fed up by such " fruitless " meeting and is determined to " comply with and implement " the Lusaka Protocol in its own way .
At the end of the committee meeting , Diallo confirmed that UNITA has obstructed the withdrawal of U.N. observer mission from Andulo and Bailundo by denying U.N. planes landing since last Friday in the excuse of " repairing " the airport runway .
But he did not make any more comments in this regard .
Diplomatic sources here believed that UNITA plans to detain U.N. personnel and take them " hostage " against possible government attack .
