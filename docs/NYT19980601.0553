NEW YORK 'S VACCO DECLARES FOR SECOND TERM
( mk ) By ABBY GOODNOUGH c.1998 N.Y .

ALBANY , N.Y .
_ Saying he has reduced crime , protected the environment and fought consumer fraud more voraciously than his predecessors , Dennis Vacco announced Monday that he would seek a second term as New York state 's attorney general .
Standing on the steps of the state Capitol with Gov. George Pataki and other powerful Republicans , Vacco said he was the first attorney general in decades to devote equal attention to fighting crime and protecting consumers .
`` They said we couldn n't reshape the attorney general 's office to focus on crime without walking away from the traditional consumer and environmental responsibilities of this office , '' Vacco told about 100 supporters and employees .
`` We did it , and I am here today to proclaim , ` Mission accomplished . '' '
Three candidates have already made it onto the ballot for the Democratic primary in September in hopes of challenging Vacco .
They are Eliot Spitzer , a former state prosecutor ; G. Oliver Koppell , a former attorney general , and state Sen. Catherine Abate .
A fourth candidate , Evan Davis , who was counsel to Gov. Mario Cuomo , has said he will petition to get on the primary ballot .
Vacco , 45 , a former U.S. attorney in Buffalo , was little known before he ran for attorney general in 1994 .
He eked out a victory over the Democratic candidate , Karen Burstein , largely because of the backing of U.S. Sen. Alfonse D ' Amato , the state 's most influential Republican .
The attorney general 's race is expected to be one of the most hotly contested this year , because Vacco is widely believed to be politically vulnerable .
Several months after he was elected , he came under heavy criticism for dismissing dozens of experienced lawyers and replacing them with younger , inexperienced lawyers , many of whose families had ties to the Republican Party .
In his speech Monday , Vacco , who campaigned in 1994 on a crime-fighting platform , focused on many of the issues that his critics say he neglected during his first two years in office : those involving consumer protection and the environment .
He described a crackdown by his office on health-care aides who abuse nursing home residents and a new division in his office that mediates disputes between managed-care companies and their patients .
