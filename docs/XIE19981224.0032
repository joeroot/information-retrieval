SHANGHAI , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The Shanghai Branch of the People 's Bank of China , the country 's central bank , will build a financial security zone across Shanghai and the two provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang to promote the economic growth of the area , said a local banker today .
To this end , the Shanghai branch of the central bank will try to use more overseas funds with its good financial order and service , Wu Xiaoling , director of the branch told a press conference for Shanghai-based overseas reporters here today .
The primary task for the branch is to standardize the financial supervision and management and strengthen law enforcement , she said .
Healthy development of a country 's financial system is vital to a country 's economic security , she said , adding that though the financial order and the quality of credit are good in the area , we should still keep a close eye on the hidden crisis .
With a comparatively developed market economy in China , Shanghai , Zhejiang and Fujian should set a good example in establishing good social credit , she said .
Her branch will be honest and clean in financial operations .
