Namibian Refugees Continue Pouring into Botswana :
JOHANNESBURG , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Botswana said Monday that more than 1,700 Namibian refugees have crossed the border into Botswana since October , with 250 arriving in the past 10 days .
" The rate of influx has slowed , but they are still coming , " South African Press Association quoted Botswana presidential office spokesman Andrew Sesinyi as saying .
So far 1,763 Namibians , including former Namibian opposition leader Meshake Muyongowere , have entered Botswana , claiming they were fleeing persecution by the Namibian government .
The Namibian government has accused them of being involved in a movement toward the secession of the Caprivi Strip from Namibia .
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) was reportedly advising the Botswana on the status of the Namibian refugees .
In mid-November , the UNHCR said it was plausible the refugees would face persecution if they returned .
But Botswana hoped some would eventually opt for voluntary repatriation .
The final decision over whether to grant asylum to the Namibians will depend on recommendations by the Botswana Refugee Advisory Committee , which is interviewing the Namibians .
Referring to living condition of the Namibian refugees , Sesinyi said the leaders of the Namibian secessionist group and their followers were separated to prevent political unrest .
However , " they are free to move , there are no restrictions except that they must not make political statements nor demonstrate , " Sesinyi said .
