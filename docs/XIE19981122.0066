Iraq Accuses Butler of Trying to Create New
BAGHDAD , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said here Sunday that chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler 's request for handing out Iraq 's secret documents of biological weapons is " provocative " and aiming at " creating new crisis . "
At a seminar sponsored by a non-governmental organization to show Arab solidarity with the Iraqi people , Aziz said some of the documents Butler requested " did not exist . "
" How can Iraq provide UNSCOM ( the U.N. Special Commission ) things that do not exist , " he said .
He added that Iraq will publish the letters between the Iraqi government and Butler in order to clarify the facts .
He accused Butler of trying to make new pretexts for U.S. military attack against Iraq and obstruct the U.N. comprehensive review of Iraq 's compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions .
Iraq agreed a week ago to unconditionally resume U.N. weapons inspections , defusing the standoff with the U.N. over Iraq 's October 31 decision to halt all cooperations with U.N. arms inspectors .
The weapons inspection in Iraq was resumed on Wednesday , one day after the inspectors returned from Bahrain , where they had relocated amid fears of possible U.S. air strikes .
