TAKING CARE OF RANGE WINS RANCHER $ 250,000 GRANT
( For use by N.Y .

PHOENIX _ Genius ?
Him ?
Bill McDonald thought it was a joke when he answered the phone Wednesday at his isolated ranch near the Mexican border .
Yeah , right , he thought , as the caller said he 'd been picked to receive a `` genius grant '' of $ 285,000 over five years from the MacArthur Foundation f or his work forging compromises among ranchers , environmentalists and government agencies .
But the call ( begin ital ) did ( end ital ) sound like it was long-distance .
McDonald 's hand went numb .
Then he thought about his tax consulta nt .
`` My God , my taxable income has just tripled , '' McDonald said of his first reaction .
Such are the problems that follow good deeds , said Sandy Eastlake , executive vice president of the Arizona Cattle Growers Association .
`` Bi ll is a brilliant man who has looked at the big picture to see what we can do to keep ourselves in business in the future , '' Eastlake said .
McDonald was recognized for his part in forming the Malpai Borderlands Group , an organization of 25 e nvironmentally aware ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico .
It has done some very unorthodox things on the 800,000 acres the cattle growers graze in the adjoining corners of the two states .
The group has worked on increasing the numbers of the threatened Chiricahuan Leopard Frog in their stock tanks and on reintroducing jaguars in the area .
They have enthusiastically backed the use of natural fires on their range for ecological cleansing ; 150,000 acres have burned in recent years .
And the non-profit Malpai group has spent more than $ 400,000 to buy `` conservation easements '' on land in their area to ensure that it stays range and is not developed .
McDonald said he is considering using much of the $ 285,000 award to buy additional conservation easements in the area , which is located east of Douglas .
`` We don n't just bang heads and make noise , '' McDonald said .
`` We 've worked with all the agencies and environmental groups and have formed some true par tnerships . ''
McDonald said the group first came together in 1992 `` to try to take care of wide open spaces and biological diversity at the same time . ''
One idea the ranchers quickly came up with was using `` grass banks , '' which allow r anchers low on forage to use the grass of his neighbor rather than overgraze his range .
`` I 've also had good success on the riparian areas on my ranch , '' said McDonald , who has 350 head of cattle on the 21,000 acres he owns and leases .
`` I l earned that you need to move cattle a lot more in tune with the needs of vegetation .
I 've got deep grass , young cottonwoods and more pools of water all through my riparian areas now . ''
The next project the group has planned is marketing low-fa t beef products from its herds on the natural-grass rangelands , McDonald said .
McDonald is one of 29 winners of stipends ranging from $ 220,000 to $ 375,000 awarded annually by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation .
Among t he other winners were Tim Berners-Lee , a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was credited with starting the World Wide Web .
It is not possible to apply for the grants , and there are no strings attached as to how the winne rs spend their money .
