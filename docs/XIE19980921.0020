British Hostages Held in Chechnya Freed
LONDON , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Two British aid workers held hostage in Chechnya were freed on Sunday after 14 months in captivity , the Foreign Office said .
The ministry said hostages Camilla Carr and Jon James were understood to be in good health despite their ordeal and were expected to arrive in London Sunday night .
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement he was delighted by the release .
" I would like to pay a tribute to Camilla and Jon for the courage they have shown through this most distressing ordeal , " Cook said .
The Foreign Office , which worked closely with Russia 's central and regional governments for the release , said it could not give precise details of when Carr and James would be back in Britain .
" This depends very much on their wishes and those of their families .
" Our objective is , of course , to get them home and reunited with their families as soon as possible . "
The two persons were held in an undisclosed location after they were captured by unknown gunmen in the Chechen capital Grozny in July 1997 .
Hundreds of hostages , including several foreigners , are currently held hostage in Chechnya , which was devastated by a war in 1994 - 96 in which Russia tried to subdue the region 's independence bid .
