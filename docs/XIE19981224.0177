Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to " Dissidents " in China ( 4 )
It is unrealistic to expect that New China would be able to perfect a democratic system in the short 50 years since its founding .
Western countries immediately imposed sanctions against China in 1989 following events in the Tian ' anmen Square .
How did the United States avoid similar action in November that year when its military forces invaded Panama , arested the country 's president and killed 400 innocent people ?
There is no fair truth amongst nations .
Power , in fact , creates truth .
Those who talk about human rights are simply hypocritical .
They lack concern about democracy in China , but instead simply question the reasons why China has failed to collapse like the former Soviet Union .
Related individuals hope to see Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions , as well as Taiwan Province , split from China .
They quite frankly want China to become nothing more than a " nation of Han . "
Are the chief plotters in some foreign " human rights organizations " truly concerned with human rights in China ?
Why did their ancestors refrain from talking about human rights when the Eight-Power Allied Forces killed Chinese people and looted the nation in 1900 ?
Why did the United States avoid the human rights issue when it provided arms and ammunition to support the Kuomintang in a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers ?
The aforementioned facts show that the United States fails to offer a good example of freedom of democracy .
In addition , its record reveals it is far from a good teacher when it comes to the human rights issue .
