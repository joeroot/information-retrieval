CLINTON-PRIVILEGE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton 's decision to limit his legal appeals to his assertion of attorney-client privilege in the Monica Lewinsky matter could yield two advantages : reducing the case to make it seem too minor for the Supreme Court to take on an expedited schedule , and limiting questioning of Bruce Lindsey , the Clinton confidant and director of damage control .
Does this mean that presidents will begin surrounding themselves with aides with law degrees ?

CIGNA-LAWSUIT _ COLUMBUS , Ohio _ In 1995 , Patty Branham was told her colon cancer had spread to her liver .
Her doctors said the only treatment that would keep her alive was a surgery that would destroy tumors by freezing them .
Branham 's managed-care health plan , CIGNA HealthCare of Ohio , refused to pay for the surgery .
It took CIGNA a month to reach that decision and another month to review Branham 's appeal , even though its experts said the surgery was an accepted medical technique .
Branham 's tumors , meanwhile , doubled in size .
And four months after her initial request for coverage , she died .
Last month , the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Branham 's husband , Craig , has the right to sue CIGNA because a company clause requiring arbitation for disagreements was vague and therefore non-binding .

MEXICO-FIRES _ CHIAPAS STATE , Mexico -- Farmers and their agricultural methods have been blamed for the fires that have been raging in Mexico and Central America .
Why do farmers use fires to burn land for growing season with such potential danger ?
Are farmers concerned about the fires and are they rethinking their agricultural methods , or can they afford to ?
Federal officials assert that peasants encroaching on the rain forest are partly to blame .
But the peasants say there is no other way .
