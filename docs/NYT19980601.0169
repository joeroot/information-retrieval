CARREY RISKS SECURITY FOR CHALLENGE OF SATIRICAL ` TRUMAN SHOW '
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By LOUIS B. PARKS c.1998 Houston Chronicle
Jim Carrey has had this strange fantasy going on in his head .
`` What if I was the only real person and everyone else was an actor ? , '' Carrey says , completely serious .
`` And I was some kind of experiment ?
`` I go to the grocery store , and the guy who , like , accidentally bumps into my shoulder and doesn n't say a word .
...
Well , that guy , you know , that 's a special little part , and he goes around a corner and high-fives a bunch of people . ''
Carrey notices he 's getting a chuckle , likes it , and begins to laugh himself .
After four years of stardom , he still seems to enjoy entertaining his interviewer , even when he 's being serious .
`` And then this guy gets on the phone to his agent , and he switches wardrobe because he 's got another scene where he just has to drive by me in a car . ''
We could dismiss such thoughts as the weird musing of a comic madman .
Except that , of course , most of us have shared the same fantasy .
Just the tiniest nagging suspicion ( or is it a hope ? ) that we really are the center of the entire universe , and everything and everybody revolves around us .
`` Every one of us , '' Carrey says , `` has at one point in our lives felt that feeling .
I was going to write a script about it at one point .
I was so relieved when Andrew Niccol suddenly came up with this brilliant script .
I didn n't have to do it . ''
The `` brilliant script '' is now `` The Truman Show , '' which opens Friday .
It 's a sharp satire that _ under the guidance of director Peter Weir ( `` Gallipoli , '' `` Witness , '' `` Dead Poets Society '' ) and with an energetic but smartly tempered comic-dramatic performance by Carrey _ is easily one of the most thought-provoking movies of the year .
Like all good satire , `` The Truman Show '' entertains while illuminating a serious aspect of contemporary society .
In this case , it 's the way those in media , particularly television , blur the lines between reality and entertainment .
Carrey 's character , Truman Burbank , was the first child legally adopted by a corporation .
That corporation immediately turned baby Truman into the star of a 24-hour-a-day , seven-days-a-week television show .
As Truman grew up , the world watched .
Truman 's friends and family are actors .
His hometown is a vast set .
Now that he 's grown , his job and wife are part of the phoney story .
Truman has no idea that every moment of his day is watched by millions of people , or that his life is not real .
Outrageous ?
Sure .
Diabolical ?
Horrifying ?
Of course .
No wonder it 's a huge ratings hit .
Would the public really buy into such a concept ?
Weir is convinced the answer is a firm yes .
`` The kind of public torture of Lady Diana and her husband ( Prince Charles ) was really a version of ` The Truman Show , '' ' says the Australian director .
`` The line between the real and unreal was blurred there .
The cameras were ( sometimes ) concealed that picked up their private moments .
The shock of her death was in some ways that they were watching a soap opera on which people don n't really die .
`` The public was enthralled by every move she made , '' Weir says .
`` She acted like a soap opera star at times , even courted trouble .
There were villains and lovers and revelations .
Dodi Fayed was like a new character introduced into the series .
He was exotic and Mediterranean .
`` Then when she died the very people who bought all this stuff were the most outraged , could have lynched the paparazzi who were out getting photos for them . ''
Those watching Truman on TV clearly find his life somehow more real than their own lives .
It may be sad and morbid , but perhaps it 's simply human nature .
`` I think at the very base of it , there 's a human goodness , '' Carrey says .
`` They 're all just people who sometimes don n't understand themselves , who kind of feed off negativity in others .
`` There is a basic need which _ if we don n't suppress it _ is to feel superior to people .
Everybody has that urge within them to see somebody who is in a worse spot than you are . ''
If there were a real `` Truman Show '' on TV , would Carrey watch it ?
`` Yeah , probably , '' he admits , as though confessing a sin .
`` I stumble across ` Jerry Springer ' and sit there sometimes .
`` That 's why the title of this movie is so great , The True-Man Show .
`` It 's like we go out of our way to see real life .
It 's not enough to see actors do their thing , or re-enactments .
We want to see the real pain and the real deal .
It 's a car-crash mentality , the rubber-necking kind of thing .
`` The Truman Show says something bad about our society .
It 's a warning , '' Carrey says .
Carrey plays Truman at the point at which he is just beginning to suspect there is something strange about his life , but he still has no idea what .
That gives the movie a touch of suspense and a hopeful prospect .
`` After everything that happens to this guy ( Truman ) , you can n't kill the human spirit , '' Carrey says .
`` You can n't put it in a fish bowl .
You can n't capture it . ''
