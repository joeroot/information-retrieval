Are we talking greatest moments ?
Or are we talking greatest events ?
And what were the standards for evaluation when , in the July 11 - 17 issue of TV Guide , a list of the `` 50 Greatest TV Sports Moments of All Time '' was compiled ?
What was the most important factor in making a determination of the worth of the moment / event ?
Did it have to be technically innovative in terms of television itself ?
Or was its significance based strictly on how compelling the moment / event was on its own ?
TV Guide concluded that Carlton Fisk 's home run to win Game 6 of the 1975 World Series for the Boston Red Sox in their Fenway Park home `` remains the ultimate moment in TV sports . ''
The summary of the moment ( not a game , in this particular case ) suggests television 's role _ hey , it 's TV Guide _ was of considerable consequence in the selection process : `` NBC director Harry Coyle kept the scoreboard camera on Fisk , creating one of the medium 's most famous reaction shots .
As if in a trance , the catcher bounced up and down near home plate , waving at the ball , willing it to stay fair .
And when the ball obeyed , caroming off the foul poul , ( Fisk ) leaped into the air and began his trot around the bases ...
''
That 's very nice .
But what about Bill Mazeroski 's home run in Game 7 to win the 1960 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the New York Yankees .
Can n't you see still the grainy black-and-white picture of fans on the field as Mazeroski runs the bases ?
It didn n't make the list .
And what about Kirk Gibson limping around the bases in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series after hitting a homer for the Los Angeles Dodgers .
It was 29th .
TV Guide wrote that its list was `` bound to spark debate . ''
Never one to turn down an invitation ...
here 's one man 's Top 10 events / moments in the history of televised sports :
HEIDI ( unlisted ) _ No joke .
It was 1968 when NBC cut away from an NFL game _ a close one _ between the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets to show a movie .
Oakland scored two quick touchdowns and won , and Heidi remains pro football 's best friend to this day .
Oh , by the way , the Jets didn n't lose again that season , and went on to win Super Bowl III .
Which brings us to ...
SUPER BOWL III ( unlisted ) _ New York Jets quarterback / jetsetter Joe Namath promised a victory over the substantially favored Baltimore Colts , and his team delivered .
This game in 1969 made Super Bowls important .
Good enough ?
REGGIE ( No.
18 ) _ Forget about the single-shot heroics that won a Series ( Mazeroski and Toronto 's Joe Carter ) or a game ( Gibson and Fisk ) .
The best power show in Series history was Reggie Jackson cracking three on three successive pitches off three different pitchers in 1977's Game 6 for the New York Yankees against the Los Angeles Dodgers .
THE ICE BOWL ( No.
3 ) _ Green Bay beat Dallas in a Lambeau Field freezer with windchills registering minus-46 degrees .
The Packers , disdaining a field-goal attempt to tie and force a playoff overtime , won on quarterback Bart Starr 's sneak in the final seconds .
A game played in 1967 remains one of football 's most memorable in terms of man vs. elements .
SOVIETS WIN ( unlisted ) _ In the gold medal game in Munich in 1972 , officials afforded the Soviet Union basketball team three chances in the final seconds to upset a U.S. team featuring the country 's best college players .
It should never have been that close , but this was the root of what has grown into a U.S. obsession of sending a Dream Team ( professionals ) to the Olympics .
SOVIETS LOSE ( No.
23 ) _ If you watched , you probably remember exactly where you were when the young U.S. Olympic hockey team upset the powerful Soviet Union at Lake Placid in 1980 .
And you probably remember the picture of U.S. goalie Jim Craig , wrapped in an American flag , skating the rink looking for his father in the stands .
UCLA-HOUSTON ( No.
49 ) _ A crowd of 52,693 _ and this was 1968 _ assembled in the Astrodome to watch Houston hometown hero Elvin Hayes and the Cougars beat UCLA 's Lew Alcindor and college basketball 's muscleboy Bruins .
If you 're looking for the place where college hoops began to nudge its way onto the main stage of sports in America , this is it .
JACK ( No.
8 ) AND TIGER ( No.
27 ) _ Jack Nicklaus was 46 years old when he won his sixth Masters in 1986 ; Tiger Woods was 21 when he won last year at Augusta .
The symmetry of it all is just too perfect to ignore .
TWO MINUTES ( unlisted ) ; NINE MINUTES ( No.
37 ) _ Secretariat by 31 lengths to seal horse racing 's Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes in 1973 ; Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns in a 1985 three-round brawl for the middleweight title .
As good as horse racing and boxing can be .
BORG-McENROE ( No.
5 ) _ As good as tennis can be .
In 1980 , McEnroe won a fourth-set tiebreak at 18 - 16 before Borg won the fifth set at 8 - 6 to claim his fifth consecutive Wimbledon title .
This rivalry _ from Wimbledon 's grass to any other court surface _ will endure as one of the best in the history of the sport for sustained excellence and the combatants ' disparate styles and personalities .
You probably have your own list , though , right ?
Greg Stoda 's column appears in the Palm Beach Post , West Palm Beach , Fla.
