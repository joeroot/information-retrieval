Italian Prime Minister Says Ocalan May Leave Italy
In an end-of-year press conference , D ' Alema said that Italy was not negotiating with any other country to take Ocalan in .
D ' Alema said even though the head of the Kurdish Worker 's Party ( PKK ) is still under surveillance in Italy , he is free to go wherever he wants under Italian laws .
" At this point , the most likely outcome is that Ocalan will leave our country , " he added .
Meanwhile , Ocalan 's lawyer said Wednesday that Ocalan could remain in Italy , either to face a trial by international court or wait for the granting of political asylum from other country .
The Rome Appeals Court lifted on December 16 travel restrictions on Ocalan , who had been arrested in Rome on November 12 .
The restrictions , forbidding Ocalan from leaving the Rome metropolitan area , had in fact been based on international warrant issued by Germany .
But Germany said that it will not seek to extradite Ocalan to Germany , for fear of sparking unrest between its own Kurdish and Turkish immigrants .
Italy has rejected Turkey 's extradition request because Italian law bars extradition to countries where defendants could face a death penalty .
