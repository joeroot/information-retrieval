ATLANTA _ Lockheed Martin is vying for a multibillion-dollar project to upgrade the military 's C-5 heavy transport jets , a contract that could mean continued stability for Lockheed and its 10,000 workers .
U.S. Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia , speaking Monday at a Cobb County Chamber of Commerce breakfast , said Lockheed is seeking two government contracts to modernize the C-5 's electronics and engines .
The Air Force plans to complete the modernization of 126 C-5 jets in two phases .
The first phase would replace the plane 's 20-year-old electronic , navigation and communication systems .
That contract , worth $ 400 million to $ 500 million , is scheduled to be awarded in September .
Lockheed spokesman Ray Crockett said the company 's main competitor is Raytheon of Waco , Texas .
The second phase would replace the C-5 engines at an estimated cost of $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion .
Bids are not out yet for the second phase , which is to start in 2002 , said Bill Arndt , Lockheed program manager for C-5 modernization .
While the two contracts could mean significant business for Lockheed , they probably won n't require additional employees , Crockett said .
Many who are working on the C-130J cargo plane would be nearing the end of their production roles and could move to the C-5 project .
The C-5 , the military 's largest cargo jet , is flown all over the world every day , said Jim Grant , Lockheed director of airlift marketing .
It can carry six Apache helicopters or two M1 battle tanks , each weighing 135,400 pounds .
The C-5 is six stories high and as long as a football field .
Despite its size , it can fly nonstop for 2,500 miles at jet speed .
In 1989 , C-5 jets delivered 2 million pounds of cleanup gear to those working on the oil spill in Alaska .
In the Persian Gulf War , they carried nearly half a million passengers , 15 mobile hospitals and more than 200 tons of mail each day .
Lockheed officials note that they built the C-5 and have the knowledge to upgrade its systems .
The electronics would be Honeywell systems and the engines would be General Electric .
The electronics and engines already are used on commericial airlines , Crockett said .
Lockheed builds the C-130J cargo plane and the new F-22 Stealth fighter jet .
Crockett said both projects represent a larger percentage of the defense contractor 's business than the C-5 .
`` But we are the builder and want to continue to be the company that takes care of the C-5 , '' he said .
The C-5 could last well into the next century , according to the Air Force .
But reliability , maintenance and operating costs could ground the plane if changes aren n't made to update the engines and electronics , the Air Force said .
It is much cheaper to replace engines and communications systems than to replace cargo jets , Crockett said .
Most of the planes , though 25 to 30 years old , still have a significant life span .
New engines would reduce the cost per flying hour by up to one-third , and the cost of operating the engine would be one-tenth of the current cost , Lockheed officials said .
