CHALLENGING CANYON HIKE IS ANSWER TO MIDLIFE CRISIS
TAKES ( With photo ) ( For use by N.Y .

( UNDATED ) _ During my b irthday party in January , my best friend asked if I 'd like to join a group hiking the Grand Canyon in early April .
My friend didn n't know that turning 40 had thrown me into a midlife crisis .
I was looking down a corridor that seemed to be getting
shorter by the minute .
What , after all , had I done with my life ?
Where had the years gone ?
Why am I suddenly getting tasteless birthday cards ?
These troubling thoughts coupled with a third beer clouded my reason : `` Yes , I 'd very much like to do that , '' I responded .
Hiking the Canyon would force me to get in shape , clear my head , give me a goal .
& QL ; & QL ;
My friend had applied to the Park Service for a backpacking / camping permit last year .
He had wanted to hike the Grandview , Esc alante and Hance trails as a loop , but the Park Service had other ideas .
We were given the Tanner Trail to hike .
The Tanner begins at the far eastern end of the South Rim , not far from the Desert View Watchtower .
The Tanner is one of the
more difficult trails in the park , listed as `` very strenuous '' by most guidebooks .
It 's between 8 and 12 miles long ( every reference had a different figure , though it 's probably eight or nine ) , and very steep at the beginning , with another very st eep portion about two-thirds of the way down .
Although I like to hike , the longest trail I ever had covered was about seven miles , at Usery Park , near the Superstition Mountains southeast of Phoenix .
Its gently rolling hills and access to a lo cal Dairy Queen would be nothing like this challenge .
`` Just sauce for the goose ! ''
I naively thought to myself .
& QL ; & QL ;
There are benefits to getting up really early .
It 's nice and calm at 4 : 30 a.m. , and still dark ; the stars and moon are o ut , the streets are clear of traffic .
The drawback , of course , is that it 's 4 : 30 a.m. , and I barely can make my legs move .
But my friend had said hiking Squaw Peak would be the best way to simulate the `` very strenuous '' conditions of our trip , and morning worked best for my schedule .
As long as sleep wasn n't important .
I decided I 'd hike Squaw Peak two or three times a week for about a month and begin carrying a pack after I had gotten into better shape .
So with 20 pounds of do g food plus other weight inside a borrowed backpack , I began the real training around mid-February .
Having never backpacked , I was unprepared for the feeling weight adds to the hiking experience .
I felt like an out-of-balance turtle walking upri ght , swaying back and forth unsteadily on the trail .
The shoulder straps hurt my shoulders .
This was taking some getting used to .
& QL ; & QL ;
By early March , I had arranged for rental equipment and had gotten advice about what to pack for our four-day , three-night excursion .
Power bars , instant oatmeal , jerky , small cans of tuna , bagels and instant soup topped the list .
We 'd also take along three precooked frozen meals for all five of us to share .
These would be cooked on gas-f ueled stoves , as campfires were forbidden .
Each would carry about a gallon of water , half of which would be cached along the way .
I 'd need enough clothes to keep warm at night , though the sleeping bag I 'd rented was supposed to be cozy down to
15 degrees .
Things were coming together , and I actually was getting excited .
What we hadn n't planned on was a little guy named El Nino .
& QL ; & QL ;
As you may recall , Arizona 's weather in March was pretty unusual .
There was a substantial amount of rain in Phoenix , and , concurrently , lots of snow up north .
Although weather is a lot less predictable at the Grand Canyon than it is here , one usually can count on the temperature at Phantom Ranch ( on the floor of the Canyon ) being about th e same as it is in Phoenix .
But all that snow and rain had us worried .
My friend recommended I be prepared for the worst .
Yet another trip to REI for a weatherproof top and bottom .
Dressed in the black outfit , I looked ( as one of our team later remarked ) like the Orkin man .
& QL ; & QL ;
The drive from Phoenix to our hotel on the South Rim was uneventful .
Although we passed many snow-blanketed areas near Flagstaff , we made good , easy time .
Our first stop after checking in at the hotel was the trailhead .
It was our first chance to see where we would hike the next day .
It was a little scary .
The trail was about 2 feet wide and covered with snow .
There was probably a beautiful vista of the Canyon buttes , but we barely could ma ke them out through the chilling fog .
For a while , we reconsidered our plan .
Perhaps another trail would be better .
But after checking in at the backcountry office , and getting reassurance that the trail was passable with crampons , our original mission was a go .
Crampons : yet another new experience .
These spikes strap onto boot insteps , and help provide footholds in snow and ice .
It was issues like using crampons , and all the other unknowns , that kept me awake during Tanner Hik e Eve .
As often happens with me , when I need sleep the most , I don n't get it .
& QL ; & QL ;
Up at 5 : 30 a.m. , on the trail by 7 : 15 .
I was layered and layered again with clothing ; it was only 8 degrees outside .
Eight degrees , with blowing snow .
We were still game , but I was nervous .
When I started down the trail , I nodded to myself : Yep , nervousness was justified .
Even with the crampons , the trail seemed treacherous .
I might have adjusted faster if it hadn n't been for the sweat streaming
into my eyes and soaking my head .
I had overdone it on the layers .
I shed a couple and began to feel better .
Slowly I got used to the trail , the snow , the crampons and the weirdly beautiful landscape .
Many writers have tried to capture the Grand Canyon in words ; just as many have tried to paint or photograph one of the world 's wonders .
All have failed ; it 's just a matter of how much .
I won n't try , except to say that if you love seeing the Canyon from the rim , imagine all that
beauty and majesty multiplied when hiking into the heart of it .
It takes your breath away , and puts things in their proper place .
In many ways , this trip was about perspective .
& QL ; & QL ;
Eventually , we made our precarious way down past the snow line .
The crampons came off and more layers of clothes .
Still cold and windy , we made our way slowly down , down .
The morning wore on , with one fantastic vista after another .
Morning gave way to midday , and we had our lunches of tuna , powe r bars and trail mix .
We almost had reached the halfway point , nicknamed Asinine Hill .
This drop-off is very steep .
Though there are switchbacks , these , too , are very steep .
Falling backward is easy , especially with a heavy pack , as I proved t wice .
Besides feeling a bit desperate with that extra weight pinning me down , I escaped without serious injury .
The afternoon was filled by passing through bizarre environments .
Hoodoos _ stone columnar formations _ towered on our left as we mar ched on .
The trail skirted the sides of slanting hills ; instead of falling forward , my body kept trying to fall sideways .
Finally , after about 6 { hours , we heard the roar of the Colorado River at Tanner Rapids .
Time to collapse .
