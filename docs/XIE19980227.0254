Mexico Rejects U.S. Certification Process
MEXICO CITY , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The Mexican government has rejected the United States ' anti-drug certification process , a process the U.S. has implemented annually since 1986 , the Foreign Ministry announced Thursday .
The ministry said in a communique , which was released only hours after Washington announced the certification of Mexico in the war against drug , that the decision to combat drug is based on the danger narcotics poses to national well-being and security , not on pressure from other countries .
The communique said the Mexican government has repeated its rejection of the certification process for its bias and for being contrary to the spirit of international collaboration .
It said the Mexican government reiterates its commitment to fight drug trafficking , while ignoring unilateral evaluations .
With respect to each other 's sovereignty and international commitments in mind , Mexico will continue its efforts to crack down on international drug traffic , the communique said .
It added that Mexico will continue to beef up global , regional and bilateral cooperation schemes in the war against trans-national drug traffic .
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has proposed a special session on drugs during the General Assembly of the United Nations , which will convene in New York from June 8 to 10 .
