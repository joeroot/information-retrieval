Annan : Reform Essential for Better U.N. Performance
UNITED NATIONS , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Reform of the United Nations " is essential if we are to play our full part in the new era , " U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Monday .
" Reform is an ongoing process , and I shall continue working on ways to improve our performance , " he said at the opening of the two-week general debate of the 53rd session of the General Assembly .
Annan hammered out U.N. reform programs , described as a process of " quiet revolution , " shortly after he took office in January 1997 .
However , the U.N. capacities were limited due to financial stringency caused by failure of few countries to pay their back dues .
" But the single greatest impediment to good performance is the financial straitjacket within we are obliged to operate , " he said .
" Financial stringency is a feature of today 's world : it has helped concentrate our minds on giving you better value for your money .
But without money there can be no value .
Stringency is one thing : a starvation diet quite another . "
The U.N. chief once again appealed to " those few member states who have fallen seriously behind with their contributions , to follow the good example set by others . "
" There can be no substitute for full and timely payment of what is due , " he added .
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said last week that by September 15 , the outstanding contributions reached 2.4 billion U.S. dollars , of which 1.6 billion U.S. dollars are owed by the United States .
The United Nations , a non-profit world body , fully relies on contributions from member states to finance its operations .
