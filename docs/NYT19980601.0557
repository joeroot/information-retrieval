URINE TEST FOR HIV WINS U.S. APPROVAL
( af ) c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Calypte Biomedical Corp. said Monday that it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin marketing its urine test for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS .
The test is the first complete urine-based diagnostic kit for HIV that does not require confirmation by blood test .
The advantages of a urine test are greater ease of use and lower cost for health care providers , and a safer procedure for patients .
According to the National Institutes of Health , there is no evidence that HIV is spread through urine , thus reducing the chances of accidental infection as a result of needle pricks or the handling of samples .
Like most blood tests , Calypte 's urine HIV test and its urine-based confirmation test both detect the presence of antibodies , not the virus itself .
Calypte itself will market the test to life insurance companies , and will join with Seradyn , a subsidiary of Mitsubishi , to sell to hospitals and clinics .
The company must perform additional clinical trials to obtain approval for a home-testing system that would be sold over the counter .
Fred Toney , an analyst with Pacific Growth , said he estimated the market for Calypte 's test to be about $ 300 million annually in the United States .
With an exclusive patent license from New York University , Calypte 's diagnostic kit `` will be the only test specifically to detect HIV antibodies in urine through 2009 , '' he said .
