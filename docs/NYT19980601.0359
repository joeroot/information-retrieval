WASHINGTON _ They call them the Righteous Brothers .
James Dobson , Gary Bauer and John Ashcroft are the vanguard of a new conservative Christian movement that is marching on Washington .
After some years in the political wilderness , America 's religious right is back .
Social conservatives feel that the Republican Party has taken them for granted , led them down the garden path and given nothing back in return .
They want an end to abortion , gay rights and gun control , and their demands are causing uproar in the party as America gears up for elections .
Imagine Britain 's Labour Party of the early 1980s crossed with the schisms of the early Church , and you 're close .
Dobson , 62 , is a broadcaster based in Colorado Springs , Colo. Bauer , 51 , a former Reagan Administration official , heads the Family Research Council .
Ashcroft , 56 , is a senator from Missouri .
They are the heirs to a tradition of religious conservatism in America that helped keep Ronald Reagan in office for eight years .
But they feel that the party _ Reagan included _ scorned them , refusing to adopt their key demands , and that the Republican party 's candidate in the 1996 Presidential race , Robert Dole , betrayed the cause .
Now they want to put things right , in every sense of the word .
It is not that religion is on the march in America ; church attendance are down over the last decade .
But there is a community within a community _ what conservative thinker William Kristol calls a `` parallel universe '' _ a flourishing world of radio stations , syndicated columns and newsletters .
It intersects with the political universe when candidates are being nominated , and small groups of highly motivated individuals can be very influential .
The Righteous Brothers have money , and they have an audience .
Bauer 's Political Action Committee , the Campaign for Working Families , has raised $ 3.7 million in contributions in a year .
Nearly 6 million people listen to Dobson 's radio show every day ; millions more have bought his books .
All three are astute , confrontational and uncompromising figures who know how to promote themselves and their agenda .
`` They say you can n't legislate morality , '' says Ashcroft .
`` Well , you certainly can . ''
But what has made them important is , in some ways , the weakness of the conservative Christian leadership .
Pat Robertson , its star in the 1980s , has been in eclipse for years .
His Christian Coalition , once the moving force behind the religious right , lost influence and became regarded by many as too willing to compromise .
Dobson and his Focus on the Family have moved into the vacuum , with a brisk , family-oriented , authoritarian moralism .
He first made his name with the charmingly-titled Dare to Discipline , a child-rearing guide for the tough of mind and hard of hand .
And it is discipline which he wants to bring back to the Republican Party : the smack of firm government .
At a series of bad-tempered meetings earlier this year , Dobson publicly threatened to pull away from the Republican Party altogether unless it started adopting his agenda .
The Republicans have had to listen : since his demarche , the quixotic party leader in the House of Representatives , Newt Gingrich , has veered towards the trio 's positions and taken a much harder stand on morality questions .
`` There 's a lot of anxiety amongst the official Republican political class to see that these guys are aboard , '' says Mark Silk , director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Political Life at Trinity College in Hartford , Conn.
`` The real concern about people like Dobson and Bauer is not an interest in what they can do positively , it is the fear of what they can do negatively . ''
Influence behind the scenes is not enough , however : Bauer and Ashcroft have both started to sound out the prospects of a presidential candidacy in 2000 .
Senator Ashcroft , with plenty of on-the-stump experience , is more likely , and could be one of three or four Republicans with a serious shot at the nomination .
But his righteous partners are already having a political impact , backing candidates in Republican primaries for this year 's Congressional races with their words and their cash , which in turn has triggered conflicts among different factions within the party .
The economy is booming and President Bill Clinton is as popular as ever , but the Republicans could still have expected a good showing in November 's elections .
The religious right , however , is causing near-civil war in some of their key campaigns .
While the Dobson and Bauer candidates have not been that successful , they have driven wedges into cracks that were already opening up within the Right .
Their most notable victory was a primary for a special Congressional election in California , where their candidate beat a moderate for the Republican nomination , only to be trounced later by the Democrat .
Ironically , Reagan 's home is in the district .
The social conservatives in the Republican Party are finding it increasingly hard to get on with the economic conservatives , and the historic marriage which Reagan helped to forge between them and the moderates is on the rocks .
Bauer and Dobson in particular are less interested in the free market than in morality , and have sparked angry words from the other side .
`` We urge the Republican leadership to abandon their plans to follow Bauer and Dobson to sure electoral defeat and instead develop a message to the fiscal conservative voters who dominate the center of the American electorate , '' wrote Mark Miller of the Republican Leadership Council .
In a trenchant analysis of the party 's ills in the Atlantic Monthly , Christopher Caldwell , a conservative , argues that the party , caught between economic conservatives , the religious right and its moderate wing , will tear itself apart .
It is becoming `` obsolescent , '' he argues .
How much does that bother Dobson or Bauer ?
`` I believe a Republican meltdown is preferable to ...
the present betrayal of the moral agenda , '' wrote Dobson .
His ally puts it more simply , saying : `` We are the party . ''
