GRAND CANYON TO BE ` WILDERNESS '
( For use by N.Y .
Times News Service clients ) By STEVE YOZWIAK c.1998 The Arizona Republic
PHOENIX _ It looks like wilderness , feels like wilderness and _ usual ly _ sounds like wilderness .
But Grand Canyon National Park is not officially wilderness .
Not yet .
But it soon will be , in all but in name .
Under a proposal released Monday , the National Park Service by year 's end would manage 94 per cent of the 1.3 million-acre park as if it were officially designated wilderness .
`` Wilderness '' is the highest level of protection granted any federal land .
The new management plan , which would not require congressional approval ,
would prevent development of roads and buildings , prohibit motorized vehicles and require that more than 120 miles of old roads be turned into trails or restored to their natural condition .
`` It 's only been in recent times that the hierarch y of the Park Service has recognized the significance of wilderness management , '' said Linda Jalbert , the park 's outdoor recreation planner .
`` Even though it 's a national park , we get a lot of pressure for new uses . ''
Among the propo sals have been new helicopter landing pads , a gondola from the rim to the river , new hotel lodges and even floating casinos .
The new plan could even mean that park rangers would repair trails with less intrusive picks and shovels , as opposed t o chain saws and jackhammers , to protect the serenity of the wilderness .
It also calls for stepped-up education programs for back-country hikers and scientific investigators .
In the past decade , several hikers have died and thousands more have bee n evacuated because of heat exhaustion and dehydration .
Since 1980 , when most of the park was first proposed as wilderness , the Park Service has bought grazing , mining and other private development rights , conducted land-use studies and in creased the acreage proposed for wilderness by nearly 10 percent .
The new draft Wilderness Management Plan also goes further , calling for 1,109,257 acres to be immediately designated wilderness as soon as Congress could act .
That would inclu de nearly all of the Canyon 's inner gorges , most of the North Rim , and the South Rim west of Hermit 's Rest .
`` All the footwork has been done , '' Jalbert said .
`` The next step would be to present a bill to Congress . ''
How far such a bill
may get in the current Congress is questionable .
Just last year Congress proposed just the opposite _ designating millions of miles of roadways in federal forests and parks to maintain access for devel opers .
Under pressure from park advocates and
a veto threat from President Clinton , the roads proposal was dropped .
Deb Gullett , administrative assistant to Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz . , said she was not aware of any plans to designate official wilderness areas in the Grand Canyon .
The Park Service plan released Monday also calls for 29,820 acres _ the Colorado River that flows for 277 miles through the park , and its shorelines _ to be designated as proposed wilderness , and that studies be done to include the river in the na tion 's `` Wild and Scenic '' river program .
The `` wild and scenic '' designation , which could be done by Congress or the secretary of the Interior , would forever prohibit dams or diversions , such as were proposed in the 1950s and 1960s .
C urrently , 39 miles of the Verde River above Horseshoe Lake is the only Arizona waterway with such protections , although environmentalists have called for up to 1,700 miles of the state 's rivers and streams to be added .
The proposed wildernes s management plan covers virtually the entire park except for the major trails ( Bright Angel and Kaibab ) that cross the canyon from the South Rim to the North Rim .
It also excludes the few areas inside the park _ mostly surrounding Grand Can yon Village and the South Rim east of the village _ that already are developed or have paved roads .
Those areas , which handle most of the park 's 5 million visitors each year , are subject to other park management plans .
Designated campsites w ould be established and natural vegetation restored at several backcountry sites where visitors now camp wherever they please : Deer Creek , Cape Final , Point Sublime , Fire Point , Swamp Point and Pasture Wash.
Campsites and trails would be reh abilitated at Horseshoe Mesa , Hermit Creek , Monument Creek and Upper Tapeats .
Trails that would be rehabilitated : Tanner , New Hance , South Bass , South Canyon and Nankoweap .
Among the roads that would be converted to trails are more tha n 40 miles of former fire roads along the North Rim .
The plan would retain 10 primitive roads that lead to wilderness trail heads , and retain seven wilderness trails for use with horses or mules .
Citizens have until July 15 to submit c omments on the proposed management plan .
