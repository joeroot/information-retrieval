EU Ready to Overcome Problems of Non-duty-free Sales
Brussels , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The European Union ( EU ) said here Thursday that it has drawn up a working document specifying the instrument available to its member states to offset the possible consequences of the abolition of intra-EU duty-free sales as from July 1 , 1999 .
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the scope of existing EU measures capable of offsetting regional , local or social difficulties which may arise from the abolition of duty-free sales beginning from next July 1 , in accordance with an EU decision in 1991 , the EU commission said .
The document explains the scope of the EU structural Funds and EU guidelines on state aid , particularly in the transport sector .
15 EU member states may use it as a basis for identifying the most appropriate measures to counteract possible regional , local or social difficulties after first assessing the problem involved .
During the current programing period of the structural funds , which expires at the end of 1999 , the commission said , the member states have taken no specific measures aimed at alleviating possible consequences of the duty-free sale abolition .
Some adjustments may still be made , but it will be possible to have greater recourse to these measures in future year , according to the level of priority granted to this question by the EU member states .
