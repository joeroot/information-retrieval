BOEING PULLS PLU ON MD-11
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By KAREN WEST c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
Faced with a lack of airline customers , Boeing pulled the plug Wednesday on its newly inherited MD-11 , commercial aircraft .
Production of the three-engine , long-range commercial jet _ the last to bear the McDonnell Douglas nameplate _ will end in February 2000 .
It 's the same airplane that McDonnell Douglas , once among the world 's biggest aircraft makers , put into service less than eight years ago .
About 4,000 jobs _ most of which are in Southern California _ could be lost as a result , but Boeing said it will try to transfer many of those employees to other areas within the company .
`` Despite our best marketing efforts , it became clear to us that there simply was not enough customer interest in either the passenger or freighter versions of this airplane to justify keeping the production line open , '' said Ron Woodard , president of Boeing 's Commercial Airplane Group .
Wednesday 's announcement , which had been expected throughout the aerospace industry , is the third McDonnell Douglas jet model Boeing has scrapped since acquiring the company in a $ 16.3 billion stock deal last summer .
Woodard had warned in March of a `` lack of interest '' in the wide-body jet , which the company had been marketing as a freight hauler .
The MD-11 , derived from the DC-10 , was launched in 1986 , first flew on Jan. 10 , 1990 , and entered service the following December .
Demand for the aircraft has declined since November and as of April 30 , Boeing had a backlog of only 13 firm orders and nine options for the jet .
The airplane currently is being produced at Boeing 's Douglas Products division in Long Beach , Calif. at the rate of one per month .
About 3,750 Boeing employees work on the MD-11 program , 3,000 of whom are located in California .
Another 600 employees manufacture MD-11 wings at the Toronto , Ontario facility ; 75 in Salt Lake City and 75 in Melbourne , Ark.
`` No one was surprised , '' said Kedrick Legg , president of the United Auto Workers union local that represents many of the 3,750 workers affected .
`` The timing was a little disappointing , '' he said .
`` The company and the union together were hoping we could make it last a little longer . ''
In November Boeing announced it would phase out production of MD-80 and MD-90 models at Long Beach , with final delivery currently scheduled for January 2000 , a month before the MD-11 line shuts down .
The new 100-seat MD-95 , which has been renamed the Boeing 717 , will be the only commercial aircraft developed by McDonnell Douglas in production after 2000 .
Boeing will unveil the 717 next week and expects to begin flight tests in September .
Of the 11,000 workers in Long Beach , about 3,000 each work on the three MD models and the rest on the Boeing 717 .
`` I realize this is a painful decision for the many employees who have worked long and hard on the MD-11 , '' Woodard said .
`` We will be producing the airplane for another 18 months and we 'll use that time to explore opportunities for alternative work for these employees .
But ultimately we will have to lay off employees for whom we do not have work . ''
Boeing announced plans earlier this year to transfer more than 1,000 employees who perform customer support and other functions at Long Beach to the Seattle area .
But the company has since decided not to relocate most of them for now , Woodard said .
Boeing said the move would not result in a special charge against earnings , as many analysts had feared .
But it will reduce second-quarter earnings , though the company declined to specify by how much .
Boeing stock rose 25 cents to close at $ 45.625 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading .
Woodard said the announcement did not mean the Long Beach factory would close .
Boeing recently announced it will use the California plant to do finishing work on some Boeing 737s , relieving pressure on the overcrowded Boeing factory in Renton , which has struggled to meet demand for its airplanes .
Boeing also is considering setting up production lines at Long Beach to make specialized versions of the 737 , including the executive Boeing Business Jets .
The company said a final decision on whether to open assembly lines for next-generation 737 models in California won n't be made until later this summer .
