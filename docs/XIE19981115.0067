Old Chinese Books Being Put On CD-ROM
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- China plans to preserve its time-honoured culture with CD-ROMs in a program that started here recently .
More than 10,000 classic works out of a group of about 130,000 are being selected .
Each will be preserved in a popular version along with one to three other important versions , according to Prof. Liu Junwen , a member of the committee working on the project .
A set of CD-ROMs can provide a handy Chinese library , he says , which will help readers search for references quickly and easily .
A group of famous Chinese scholars headed by Ji Xielin , a professor at Beijing University , will compile the works , and Luo Peilin , another academic , will be in charge of the technical committee .
The CD manufacturers and the publisher will be selected through public bidding .
The whole project is expected to be completed in 5 to 8 years .
