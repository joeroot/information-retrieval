UK Court Rules Pinochet May Travel to Doctor
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- A British court ruled on Wednesday that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet could leave his residence where he is under house arrest , if he needed to see a doctor .
The court said it would be up to the senior police officer guarding Pinochet to decide how many people could accompany him to a hospital or clinic , or visit him there , if such a situation arose .
Pinochet 's lawyer said a dentist has visited the mansion in south of London , where Pinochet is staying , to give him treatment .
Pinochet was arrested at the request of a Spnish court on October 16 at a London hospital where he was recovering from a back surgery .
A Spanish judge accused the 83-year-old general of responsibility for the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people during his 1973 - 1990 rule in Chile , and wanted him to be extradited to Spain to face charges .
The court on Wednesday also set February 1 , 1999 for the next hearing on Pinochet 's extradition to Spain .
The extradition hearing had originally been set for January 18 , but Britain 's House of Lords last week decided to re-hear the question of whether Pinochet is immune from prosecution in Britain on that same date .
There was no point in having an extradition hearing before the Lords had made their decision , the court ruled .
