Cybercop Suggested to Counter Rumor-Mongering on
KUALA LUMPUR , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- An information technology ( IT ) consultant has suggested that Malaysia form a vigilant group known as " Cybercop " as an alternative method to counter negative elements including rumor-mongering through the internet .
Making the suggestion Thursday , the Association of Computer Industry Malaysia Chairman Shaifubahrim Saleh said Cybercops should consist of people who are computer wizards who know how to patrol into the Internet .
Cybercops who could come directly under the Home Ministry or the police , would be technically-sound to detect any illegal usage of the Internet , Shaifubahrim said , adding " If people know that there are these intelligent undercover cybercops , they would be more cautious in what they do . "
" Forming Cybercops would be more effective than registering customers who wanted to use the Internet in cybercafes , " he told the Malaysian national news agency Bernama in an interview .
The suggestion came after an official announcement early this month compelling cybercafes to register their customers in order to keep tabs on cyber rumor-mongering , a move which was considered to be counter-productive to the government 's own effort to develop an IT-literate society .
Shaifubahrim was of the view that registering customers would discourage honest users from using the Internet as people from all age-group used the facility regularly at cybercafes .
He said rumors could still be spread by other ways such as writing a poison-pen letter as there are computer whiz kids who know how to use other people 's computer ID and hide their own identity .
