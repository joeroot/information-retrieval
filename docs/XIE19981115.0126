Study : Traffic Congestion Not Just Big-City Problem in U.S.
LOS ANGELES , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- The amount of time commuters spent in traffic jams in small and medium-sized U.S. cities has more than quadrupled since 1982 , growing at a far faster rate than it has in larger cities , according to a study released this week .
Since 1982 , drivers in medium-sized and small cities like Indianapolis , Kansas City , Rochester , Colorado Springs and Salt Lake City have endured the biggest jump in traffic delays , an increase ranging from 440 percent to 700 percent .
The study defines a medium-sized urban area as having a population of over half a million and less than one million .
A small city is defined as having less than half a million residents .
The study , conducted by the Texas Transportation Institute , the largest university-based transportation research organization in the United States , analyzed traffic in 70 cities across the country in 1996 .
The organization has measured an area 's population density , traffic volumes and the numbers of freeway and major street lanes over the last 16 years .
Researchers found that congestion levels since 1982 have risen in all cities except two -- Phoenix and Houston .
Los Angeles has been having the worse traffic for 16 straight years , followed by Washington D.C. , Miami , Chicago and San Francisco-Oakland .
According to the study , drivers stuck in traffic wasted more than 6.7 billion gallons of fuel in 1996 , enough to fill 670,000 gasoline tank trucks .
In the country 's most congested cities , the waste amounts to more than 100 gallons per driver every year .
The total cost of traffic congestion in the cities studied amounted to almost 74 billion U.S. dollars .
Delay costs account for 88 percent of that total , with the remainder due to wasted fuel .
To address the problem , researchers said a range of strategies are required , including projects such as bus / carpool lanes , transit operating and capital improvements , coordinating traffic signals to speed traffic and removing crashes and vehicle breakdowns from the traffic stream .
The possible solutions also include managing demand through variable work hours or telecommuting , and rearranging the land use patterns to decrease the reliance on motor vehicle travel , said the study .
