U.S. Olympic Consultant Defends Himself
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Mahmoud El-Farnawani , a former Egyptian national volleyball coach , was paid $ 58,000 as a consultant for the Salt Lake bid committe in 1994 - 95 , but he said he only offered information , not votes , to Utah Olympic bidders .
According to the Salt Lake Tribune , he did not attempt to buy votes of International Olympic Committee members in behalf of Salt Lake 's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games .
El-Farnawani said he was quite familiar with nearly three dozen IOC members during his coaching career .
" I made introductions , gave Salt Lake City all knowledge about this person or that family , what he likes , however many children he has , what his history is and son on , so they know something about about him , like what he eats , " he told The Tribune .
" Some people from my group don n't eat pork or ham , or don n't want to have alcohol on the table .
It all helps to make the IOC member feel he is taken care of and to feel they respect his background and religion , " he said .
EL-Farnawani said he " assure " the IOC 's Arab vote for Salt Lake City .
" I offered my service to Quebec , " another of the four cities that sought the 2002 Games , El-Farnawani was quoted then as saying .
" But they didn n't want anybody from outside Quebec .
So I signed a contract with Salt Lake City and assured them of all the Arab votes . "
El-Farnawani declined to say which IOC members he contacted .
" If you trust me to work with people , I won n't expose who I contacted , " he said .
" Salt Lake did not need bribes .
They knew they were going to win .
Linking me to ( bribery allegations ) has to come from someone who is jealous or envied my success , " El-Farnawani told The Tribune .
El-Farnawani said he had been unaware of the scholarships for IOC relatives .
The SLOC hired the international law firm Latham & AMP ; Watkins to represent it in whatever issues may arise with the U.S. Justice Department .
The Justice Department was reported to be conducting a preliminary inquiry , with help of the FBI , to probe whether or ganizers may have engaged in fraud .
