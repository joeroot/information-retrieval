INVESTORS DESERT TECHNOLOGY STOCKS ( JT )

NEW YORK _ Investors seeking to avoid the turmoil in Asian and Russian financial markets bought blue-chip stocks and Treasury bonds Monday .
But technology issues _ led by Intel _ fell , pushing the Nasdaq composite index down almost 2 percent to its lowest level in almost three months .
The buying supported prices of electric utilities , beverage , food and household products companies , as well as retailers .
Shares of Consolidated Edison , Coca-Cola , McDonald 's , Procter & AMP ; Gamble , Sears , Roebuck and Wal-Mart Stores rose as investors placed bets that the profits of those companies would be shielded from Asia 's economic and political problems .
Shares of other companies that stand to benefit from Asia also increased .
Travelers Group 's stock closed higher on news the financial services company will buy a 25 percent stake in the Nikko Securities Co. , Japan 's third-largest brokerage firm .
Travelers closed at 63 , up 1 } .
And Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing gained 1 { , to 94 [ , as some analysts focused on recent comments by management that earnings would continue to grow in 1998 despite weakness in Asia .
Overseas , prices fell 3.6 percent in Hong Kong and 2.2 percent in Tokyo .
Shares also fell in London , while several other European markets were closed for a holiday .
In Russia , stocks , bonds and its currency , the ruble , fell , continuing last week 's downward trend .
Those markets declined on news that the International Monetary Fund will not make new loans to Russia .
The loans would enable Russia to repay its maturing government debt and shore up the ruble .
The unsettledness in global markets was a boon for the dollar .
The American currency rose to almost 140 yen , its highest level against the Japanese currency in seven years .
Further bolstering the dollar was weakening demand for gold , especially from India , which pushed the price of gold to its lowest level in four months .
`` Our markets are acting like a major magnet to attract foreign investors , '' said John Shaughnessy , chief investment strategist at Advest Group , who attributed some of the early gains among the well-known , large-capitalization issues to foreign buying .
A strong dollar increases the return on dollar-denominated investments , such as stocks and bonds .

Early in the day , stocks also gained strength from a modest decline in a key indicator of manufacturing strength .
The National Association of Purchasing Management 's monthly index fell to 51.4 in May from 52.9 in April , its second consecutive decline .
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.42 points , to 8 , 922.37 .
Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500-stock index was little changed , up 0.16 point , to 1 , 090.98 .
While both the Dow and the S&AMP ; P traded higher throughout the morning , their gains began to evaporate during the afternoon as investors started to lose heart because of the continued weakness among technology issues , analysts said .
The Nasdaq , a key barometer of technology shares , closed at 1 , 746.82 , down 32.05 points .
Foreign market activity will continue to be a focus of domestic investors until second-quarter earnings reports come out in July , said Robert Basel , head of listed trading at Salomon Smith Barney .
Thomas Galvin , chief investment officer at Donaldson , Lufkin & AMP ; Jenrette , agreed , saying , `` I think for most Americans , what they see happening abroad , makes them want to stay red , white and blue . ''
As a result , retailers , utilities , consumer staples and health care stocks will continue to do well in the near term as long as the dollar remains strong , he said .
While major stock indexes have slipped from record highs in recent weeks , the blue-chip buying has some analysts worried .
`` I 'm a value player and I don n't see much value here , '' cautioned Larry Rice , chief investment officer at Josephthal & AMP ; Co. `` We 're still close to being overvalued . ''
