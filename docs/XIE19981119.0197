PNG Trade Unions Threaten National Strike
CANBERRA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Trade union movement in Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) Thursday threatened to invoke a nationwide strike unless the PNG government under Prime Minister Bill Skate rescinds a decision made in its 1999 budget this week to abolish key industrial relations bodies .
The Papua New Guinea Trade Union Congress , which represents 70,000 workers , said that the government 's move to scrap various industrial tribunals , boards and councils was " anti-democratic " and the start of persecution against trade unionists .
According to the budget papers released Monday , the Skate government plans to abolish the Minimum Wages Board , the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal , the Office of the Industrial Registrar , the National Training Council and the National Tripartite Consultative Council .
" It amounts to confrontation ...
it amounts to human rights abuse , " PNG Trade Union Congress acting general secretary Clemence Kanau told the Australian Associated Press .
" We want the government to retract what they have done and provide ( the industrial bodies ) more funding . "
Kanau said the congress would consider serious industrial action , including calling for a national strike .
" We have the capacity to shut down the mines , the ports , banks and communications , " Kanau said .
The congress claims that the abolition of the industrial bodies will result in no protection of wages , conditions and workers ' rights ; no security of employment ; and no trade union rights for workers .
