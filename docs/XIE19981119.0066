Madrid Up Stakes for In-Demand McMan
LONDON , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Spanish club Real Madrid appear to be stepping up their bid for Liverpool 's Steve McManaman - but they are only one of 14 clubs in the running .
McManaman 's adviser Colin Gordon admitted Thursday that the European Champions had made an inquiry about the England midfielder but insisted that reports suggesting a deal was about to be done were well wide of the mark .
He added that the 26-year-old star , who has been with the Anfield club since leaving school , has still not decided to leave Merseyside .
With his contract due to expire at the end of the current campaign , McManaman is one of the hottest properties in the game .
