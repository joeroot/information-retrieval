Indonesian Students , Common People Rally in Jakarta
JAKARTA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesian students and common people staged separate rallies in front of the House of Representatives ( DPR ) building here Monday , urging the government to take measures to solve the country 's problems .
About 500 students stressed the need for national reconciliation in settling the country 's problems and preventing disintegration .
Rally coordinator Andi Faizal said national reconciliation is needed to accommodate the people 's interests .
Tensions in Indonesia have flared as the country 's descent into poverty worsens .
Thousands of ethnic Chinese have fled the country after being targeted in fierce rioting in recent months .
Separatist protests have also mounted in some provinces since former president Soeharto resigned on May 21 .
It was reported that the government has decided to establish a National Reconciliation Team to head off the rising threat of disintegration and separatism in the country .
Meanwhile , a group which consisted of men , housewives and children belonging to several organizations sought a reduction in the prices of staple food and the setting up of a National Reform Board .
Rally coordinator Anhar Nasution said it is time for the government to form such a board to solve the economic problems .
However , the board membership should exclude government officials as their presence could undermine the board 's independence .
The rallies were peaceful but security officers stood guard at the gates .
Jakarta Police chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajusman called for an end to the holding of rallies which only disturb public order .
Students in Jakarta and other cities held rallies almost every day this month to protest the spiraling prices of the basic commodities .
They urged President B.J. Habibie to take concrete measures to solve the economic problems .
In Banjarmasin , capital of South Kalimantan province , thousands of commuters were stranded Monday as thousands of public transportation drivers went on strike to demand for a reduction in the prices of vehicle spare parts .
The strike paralyzed the city as drivers of city , inter-city and inter-province transportation stopped operations , according to Antara News Agency .
Strikes staged by public transportation drivers have recently hit several cities in the country , including Medan , capital of North Sumatra province , and Samarinda , capital of East Kalimantan province .
