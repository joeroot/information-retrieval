WASHINGTON -- Several Republicans of the U.S. Senate say censure should be considered only after a speedy impeachment trial , and perhaps only after a vote on whether to remove President Bill Clinton from office .
There is , however , widespread agreement among Republicans and Democrats that any trial should be quick , given that senators of both parties widely agree that there 's little chance that the chamber will vote to convict and remove Clinton .
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has said the chamber has a constitutional responsibility to at least open such proceedings .

CAIRO -- Egypt has warned that Israel 's halt to the implementation of the Wye River accord will lead to collapse of the Middle East peace process and violence in the region .
In an interview with a national daily Al Gomhuria , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said suspension of the implementation of the accord is " very dangerous " .
" This plays havoc with constant world efforts to establish peace , stability and security in the region , " Mubarak told the mouthpiece of the ruling National Democratic Party .
Under the Wye River peace accord signed with the Palestinians in October , Israel should withdraw from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three phases .
After carrying out the first phase of the withdrawal , Israel suspended the implementation of the second phase , citing Palestinians ' failure to stop anti-Israeli rhetoric and cancel the plan to declare an independent state next May .
