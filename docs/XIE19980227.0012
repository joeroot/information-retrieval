BAGHDAD , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- A team of the U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) charged with dismantling Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction Thursday held a meeting with representatives of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate , Iraq News Agency ( INA ) Thursday .
But the report said the meeting was on the inspection of chemical weapons .
It failed to give more details .
The INA said 15 UNSCOM teams in charge of weapons inspection in Iraq visited 14 sites today with full cooperation from the Iraqi side .
Three teams used helicopters .
The agreement on weapons inspection signed by Iraq with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad Monday granted the UNSCOM complete and unconditioned freedom to inspect Iraqi presidential palaces .
So far , the UNSCOM has not inspected any of these palaces , awaiting relevant instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New York .
UNSCOM Chief Richard Butler is expected to visit Baghdad early next month for talks with Iraqi officials on the work of the U.N. weapons inspection teams in Iraq .
