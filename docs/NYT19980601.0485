MILOSEVIC MOVES TO WIPE OUT KOSOVO REBELS ( JT )

BELGRADE , Serbia _ President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has started a sweeping campaign to wipe out a separatist rebel movement in the Serbian province in Kosovo , senior NATO officials and Western diplomats say .
The campaign involves several thousand heavily armed special police officers and soldiers backed by artillery batteries .
It has escalated swiftly over the last three days and seems set to extinguish the faint hope of a negotiated settlement between Serbs and Kosovo 's ethnic Albanian population .
If the conflict spilled across the border , as many now fear , it could draw the region into a war .
Neighboring Albania is sympathetic to the separatist struggle in Kosovo , as is a restive ethnic Albanian minority in Macedonia .
`` NATO is watching the evolving situation in Kosovo with increasing concern as the conflict there has intensified , '' said Gen. Wesley Clark , the American who is supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe , in an interview at NATO headquarters in Belgium on Friday .
He added : `` There are increasing reports of the use of artillery and heavy weapons by the Serbs .
We have heard reports of these weapons being used along the border and in other places . ''
The Albanian government said Monday that about 1,000 ethnic Albanians , some wounded , had fled into Albania from Kosovo since Sunday .
The Serbian police confirmed Monday that they were engaged in heavy combat and had `` liquidated several dozen terrorists '' in the central Drenica region .
Phone lines and roads to the areas under attack are cut , but reports are filtering out of numerous dead , not only ethnic Albanians but also Serbian civilians , police officers and soldiers .
Milosevic 's decision to unleash his troops on the ethnic Albanian rebels undermines an American diplomatic effort to bring the two sides together .
Richard Holbrooke , the U.S. envoy , had secured Milosevic 's agreement to begin direct talks with the Albanian leadership , and had as a result decided that sanctions on Belgrade should be suspended .
The about-face on the sanctions has angered many European allies , since Washington originally pushed Europeans to adopt them .
Milosevic has been unable to seal off the mountainous and desolate border with Albania .
Over the last few weeks he has watched weapons , supplies and mercenaries _ many of them veterans of the Bosnian conflict and others _ flood into Kosovo to build up the Kosovo Liberation Army , senior Western diplomats said .
The rebel force is fighting for a separate state in a province where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one .
It already controls as much as 40 percent of the province and has been engaged in daily hit-and-run clashes with the police and the military in the last three months .
More than 200 people have been killed since March , including three Yugoslav soldiers gunned down at the Morina border post near northern Albania on Friday .
The Serbian police have prevented reporters and outside observers from reaching the fighting .
Those fleeing the area , however , report constant automatic fire and the crash of artillery rounds .
Many villages are burning , especially those near the Albanian border , witnesses said in telephone interviews Monday .
The ferocity of the combat appears to be greater than the bloody sweep in March by Serbian special police units that left 80 ethnic Albanians , half of them women and children , dead .
It was this attempt to wipe out the rebels that triggered the current open revolt in the province and swelled the ranks of the guerrilla movement .
`` There is a very clear pattern of activity emerging , '' said a Western official who follows the conflict .
He described the Serbs ' thinking this way : `` The Serbs are putting the army on the border and clearing the zone .
You have to have an eight to ten kilometer wide stretch where no neutral people live , anyone there is an enemy .
You have to get them out of those villages , otherwise they can help the Albanians smuggle .
At the same time the Kosovo Liberation Army is trying to build , fortify and equip its base areas for training and using its force . ''
Until now , most of the fighting has been in the words of a senior NATO official , `` a distraction , a skirmishing line . ''
This official said that the rebels kept up desultory fire on checkpoints and road blocks to `` intimidate the Serbs and keep them from focusing directly on the base areas . ''
The fighting now , however , is different with elite special police and military units moving to wipe out rebel enclaves along the border with Albania and in the central Drenica region , according to witnesses in Pristina reached by telephone .
Clark said that NATO , worried about the impact on neighboring states , was carrying out `` detailed studies of possible preventive deployment '' and `` was preparing exercises for consideration . ''
But NATO officials conceded that it could take up to 20,000 soldiers to police the border with Albania and doubted that it would be possible to find the support necessary to deploy such a large contingent .
Without such a force many fear that the Serbs will cross into the lawless region in northeastern Albania in pursuit of the rebels , perhaps drawing Albania into the war .
The Serbian government , which agreed last month to hold talks with the ethnic Albanians in order to stave off sanctions , said it would meet for a second time with the Kosovo Albanian leaders on June 5.
Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and top advisers met President Clinton in Washington on Friday and said they were promised that Kosovo would not become another Bosnia .
But few observers see dialogue as a way out .
