U.S. Commerce Secretary to Visit Nigeria
LAGOS , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley is to visit Nigeria early next month with a goal of increasing trade and investment in the country , according to the U.S. Information Service ( USIS ) in Lagos .
A statement issued by the USIS Wednesday said that Daley , expected to arrive in Nigeria on December 6 , would hold bilateral talks with officials of the Nigerian government and exchange views with members of the Nigerian and American business communities .
The statement noted that the visit would focus on tele-communications , information technology , computers and software , agro-business , power generation and environmental technologies .
Daley , to be accompanied by a business team representing 18 U.S. companies , was quoted as saying that the U.S. private sector had a strong interest in the African market .
Nigeria has maintained its position as the biggest trading partner of the U.S. in Africa with American imports from Nigeria amounting to six billion U.S. Dollars last year .
Relations between Nigeria , the U.S. and its European allies hit an all-time low under the government of the former Head of State General Sani Abacha .
However , the frost in diplomatic relations did not affect trade matters with the U.S. importing some 40 percent of Nigeria 's crude oil annually .
