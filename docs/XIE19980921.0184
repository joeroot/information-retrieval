News Analysis : Is Famine Imminent Bangladesh ?
DHAKA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- When flooding waters are fast receding after ravaging Bangladesh for more than two months and inflicting heavy losses both of life and property , fears of a possible famine after the deluge are looming large in the country .
The devastating flood , which once submerged nearly three-fourths of the country 's land , seriously affected some 30 million people in 52 out of the country 's 64 districts and left more than 1,000 people dead .
Losses are enormous .
Some 1.45 million hectares of crops were washed away , incurring a loss of 38 billion taka ( about 808.5 million U.S. dollars ) in agriculture , Food and Agriculture Minister Begum Motia Chowdhury said Sunday .
The damage to crops may produce an estimated food shortage of 2 million tons , according to official estimates and some experts put the loss of food grains at 2.5 million to 2.7 million tons .
Bangladesh already suffers an annual food deficit of some 2.3 million tons in normal years and with flood-caused losses this year , the deficit soars to 4 million tons , said the agriculture minister .
And experts said however that the figure may be as high as 4.5 million to 4.7 million tons , leaving a huge gap for the government to fill .
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly assured the nation of adequate food supply and vowed that none " will be allowed to die of starvation , " pinning her hope on donors ' assistance and imports by the government and by the private sector .
More than 4 million tons of food grains would be made available through import and external aid , Hasina told the nation last Monday .
The government would import 1 million tons and the private sector 1.5 million tons while the remaining 1.5 million tons would be met by assistance from donor countries and agencies , she said .
" We are expecting a stock of 600,000 to 700,000 tons of food grains after meeting the deficit " at the end of the financial year ending on July 30 , 1999 .
The World Food Program has promised to provide an extra 350,000 tons of food grain for the flood-stricken people , in addition to its allocation of 542,000 tons , and the United States has also announced 400,000 tons of food aid .
Other donor countries and international agencies have pledged some 110,000 tons .
But a pledge is just a pledge and it probably won n't come soon enough , observers here said , considering the government 's slow response to the severity of flood and its delayed appeal for international assistance .
The observers also doubted whether the prime minister could keep her promise .
Even if she could get what she promised , they said , problem exists concerning how to distribute the relief adequately and efficiently and ensure that those in real need could get their share .
The official relief operations have been conducted by ministers , members of parliament of the ruling party and ruling party workers , a report in the latest issue of the Dhaka Courier weekly magazine said , reportedly focusing on their constituencies .
And the government has turned down a proposal of the opposition to set up an " All-Party Flood Relief Committee , " which the opposition said could improve the efficiency and fairness in relief distribution .
The opposition has repeatedly accused the government of " failing to stand by the flood-hit people " and of corruption and mismanagement in distributing relief materials .
If the government 's claim of no mismanagement in relief distribution was true , the observers said , it should not be afraid of setting up the all party committee , which would unite all in undertaking and overseeing relief activities and thus prove wrong allegations of irregularities and pilferage in distribution of relief goods .
The Bangladeshi government has drawn up a master plan for feeding the poor and for post-flood rehabilitation , under which it will launch six programs -- Test Relief , Gratuitous Relief , Vulnerable Group Feeding ( VGF ) , Food for Work , Vulnerable Group Development Program , and Food for Education .
Under the three-month program of Vulnerable Group Feeding card system , which started early this month and will last till the end of November , 2.5 million flood-affected families would each be given a VGF card and each card holder would get 16 kilograms of rice a month as relief , Finance Minister Shah A.M.S .
Kibria told reporters early this month .
But whether the flood victims can become self-supporting after that is not known , as many of them have lost everything they had in the prolonged flood and winter is coming to the country very soon , the observers said .
The task before the government is twofold -- to make sure that food is available and accessible to the poor and to improve their purchasing capacity by providing the poor with work and loan , according to the observers .
Whether a famine would occur in post-flood Bangladesh depends not on the volume of food available , but on the management of relief operations and implementation of the plans , and ultimately , depends on the government itself , they added .
