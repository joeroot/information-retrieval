U.S. Survey Shows 1998 as Year of Megadeal
LOS ANGELES , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Led by remarkable surges in mergers and acquisitions ( M&AMP ; A ) involving U.S. purchasers and targets , global M&AMP ; A activity during the first three quarters of 1998 surpassed the full-year record set in 1997 .
As shown by a M&AMP ; A survey released Wednesday by U.S. professional service firm KPMG , total spending on cross-border transactions soared to 383 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in the first three quarters , up 67 percent from the same period last year .
The explosion of cross-border M&AMP ; A spending is being triggered by " megadeals " in almost every sector of industry , said KPMG .
KPMG defines megadeals as deals in which the purchase spending is at least one billion dollars .
The largest 1998 cross-border megadeal thus far has been the purchase of automaker Chrysler of the United States by Daimler-Benz of Germany .
Megadeal purchasers spent 229 billion dollars on 61 cross-border targets during the first three quarters this year , more than tripling the amount spent on 35 cross-border megadeals during the same period in 1997 .
As investors in global debt and equity markets have fled developing countries during 1998 , the new trend of cross-border megadeals has shifted to the world 's more advanced economies , said KPMG .
Targeting on Asian firms dropped modestly in the first three quarters , and spending on targets in all major developing countries except Brazil dropped sharply .
Underscoring this trend is a doubling in cross-border M&AMP ; A spending targeting firms in the European Union ( EU ) , to 180 billion dollars .
Further , KPMG said U.S. businesses have again become the engine for global M&AMP ; A.
Fifty-six percent of all cross-border deals spending worth of 215 billion dollars linked U.S. firms to buyers or sellers abroad during the period .
In addition to the unprecedented 105 billion dollars spent by foreign-based firms on U.S. targets during the period , and despite a weakening dollar , U.S. firms accelerated their M&AMP ; A spending abroad , too .
U.S. companies announced a record 110 billion dollars of purchases elsewhere in the world , more than doubling last year 's figure .
