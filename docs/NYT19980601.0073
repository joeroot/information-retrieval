ATLANTA _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct mail and telemarketing lists ?
There are many ways , easy ways , to get on the lists .
To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so simple .
One way of getting on lists was revealed this month when American Express announced it would sell certain purchasing information about its card holders to retailers , who could then send advertisements or other sales promotions to them .
But American Express card holders should not feel alone .
Every time you provide your name and address to buy a product or service , including many bank credit card purchases , there 's a good chance you eventually will be added to other marketing lists .
Lists of names and addresses and telephone numbers are compiled by marketers from countless sources , including the telephone book .
Such a list , of course , is too general for most marketers who want more specialized `` response '' lists of consumers who have bought certain kinds of merchandise that indicate they might respond to similar offers .
Numerous telemarketers and direct mail firms , including some mail order catalogs and magazines , sell , rent or `` share '' their lists .
If you are a customer of one mail order company , you are likely to receive promotions from other mail order companies .
If you subscribe to a cooking magazine , you may soon receive mail order catalogs for kitchen supplies .
It 's possible to get your name deleted from many mail and telephone lists , but it takes persistence .
Even then , there is no guarantee that the plague won n't return .
A lot of information about individuals is part of the public record that 's available to anyone , and there 's nothing you can do to stop marketers from gathering such information , which includes home sales and birth , marriage and death records .
Other public domain information includes high school and college directories of alumni with names , addresses and phone numbers .
If you are a doctor , lawyer , dentist , engineer or teacher , you probably belong to one or more professional societies with directories showing your name and address .
Marketers also gather your name and address and other personal facts about you from sources that you can restrict to some degree if you are aware of what 's happening .
For example :
_ Most sweepstakes and contests require you to fill out applications listing names , addresses and phone numbers , and some request other personal information such as salary range and education level .
Guess what happens to this information ?
_ Some charities , nonprofit organizations , clubs and associations rent or sell their membership and supporter lists as a way to bring in revenue .
_ When you fill out a warranty card for an appliance or other product , it often requests information , such as salary range and hobbies , that 's not needed for warranty protection .
This information may be sold for marketing purposes .
To control the release of such personal information , there are two things you can do that will help some .
First , provide as little personal information as possible .
Second _ and this is something you likely will have to do repeatedly _ contact organizations you join , magazines you subscribe to , charities you support , your credit card issuers and other creditors and ask them to delete your name from lists they might rent or sell to other merchants and organizations .
There are two major `` shotgun '' actions you can take that are your best bets for substantially reducing unwanted mail promotions and telemarketing calls : Contact the Direct Marketing Association and the three major credit bureaus .
The Direct Marketing Association offers its Mail Preference Service and Telephone Preference Service , which removes your name from the mail and telemarketing lists of its members , most of whom are major national marketers .
Write to Mail Preference Service at P.O .
Box 9008 , Farmingdale , N.Y .
11735 , and Telephone Preference Service at P.O .
Box 9014 , Farmingdale , N.Y .
11735 .
This will not stop mail or calls from charities or small marketers who are not DMA members , but it will stop a major portion of direct mail solicitations and telemarketing calls .
The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to `` opt out '' of lists of consumers that credit bureaus provide to banks , retailers , credit card companies and other firms that intend to make unsolicited offers of credit by mail or phone .
If you don n't want to be included on such lists , call Equifax at 1 - 800-556-4711 , TransUnion at 1 - 800-680-7293 and Experian at 1 - 888-567-8688 .
If the system works as it is supposed to , you need call only one of the bureaus to be taken off the lists by all three .
One final help in stopping telemarketing calls is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act , which requires telemarketers to maintain `` don n't call '' lists of customers who don n't want to be called .
But you have to tell each telemarketer who calls that you don n't want to be called again _ and the law doesn n't apply to charities and political groups .
