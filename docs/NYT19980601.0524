( For use by clients of the New York Times News Service ) How 3 Retailers Fared on the Web By Carol Emert c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle It seemed like a bad omen for small businesses when Saks Fifth Avenue gave up on electronic commerce earlier this year .
After all , if a sophisticated retailer like Saks couldn n't make money on the Web , how could more modest merchants ?
Billy Blue , a San Francisco men 's clothier , provides a more optimistic model for cyber retailers : While its total online sales have been relatively small , the site has sold more upscale apparel in the past two months than Saks did in its 18 months on the Web .
`` Saks will come back when they realize they made a mistake , '' says Billy Bragman , owner of Billy Blue .
Billy Blue is just one of 700,000 small businesses with some type of Web presence and one of 70,000 with secure ordering capability , according to International Data Corp. Thousands more small companies , defined as those with fewer than 100 employees , are signing on each month .
No one knows how many of these sites are profitable .
As with large retailers , it is possible for a small business to sink hundreds or thousands of dollars into a Web site and see little or no return .
For many of the early entrants , profits aren n't even expected until significantly more consumers are spending considerably more money on the Web .
The three Bay Area merchants profiled below have each established a presence on the Web with some degree of success .
_ Billy Blue ( & LR ; www.billyblue.com & LR ; ) has sold $ 7,000 worth of Web merchandise in the last two months , including four horsehide coats for $ 695 each and numerous packages of underwear .
( By contrast , Saks sold less than $ 3,000 of merchandise in a year and a half . )
Billyblue.com has attracted a surprising amount of global business , including an order for a coat from Belarus ( part of the former Soviet Union ) and one for 20 pairs of boxers from Panama .
Bragman made the mistake of promising the Belarus customer free air shipping before finding out the cost : $ 190 .
But it 's all part of the learning process , and that will give Billyblue.com an edge over Web latecomers , Bragman hopes .
`` Ultimately there 's so much earning potential that even if I lose a couple of grand now ( on mistakes ) , it 's worth it , '' he said .
Billyblue.com , which offers 120 items , has gone through three redesigns since a simple home page launch in 1995 on the Virtual Village & UR ; & LR ; `` shopping mall , '' a Web site that hosts a lot of retail sites .
Bragman estimates costs of the most recent redo , in March , at $ 5 , 000 , which includes graphic design , a $ 1,200 digital camera and various service fees .
The two earlier , simpler versions cost a total of $ 1 , 200 .
Bragman expects Web volume eventually to top sales at his Geary Street boutique , which he opened in 1986 .
But the biggest bonanza to date came from attracting Netscape founder Marc Andreesen , who became Billy Blue 's best customer after first checking out the online store .
The site , which is updated with new products each month , is also an effective advertisement for some existing Billy Blue customers , who visit Billyblue.com occasionally and come into the store when they see something they want .
Bragman hopes to place ads for the site on Silicon Valley corporate intranets , although so far he hasn n't found anyone willing to sell him space .
`` The first mistake you can make as a retailer is not being on the Web , '' Bragman said .
_ Frederick Douglass Designs & LR ; ( www.citycom.com / fddesigns / ) & LR ; , an African American greeting card company in Berkeley , has also found an international clientele on the Web .
The company , founded in 1983 by siblings Margot and Joseph Dashiell , sells cards through a catalog and about 35 department and specialty stores in the United States , including a headquarters showroom on Folger Street .
In a little more than a year on the Web , the company has generated about $ 10,000 in online sales , including orders from Brazil , the Netherlands and Japan .
Some of the global orders come from U.S. military personnel stationed overseas , but many others are from people of African descent living in Europe and South America , said Margot Dashiell .
Frederick Douglass Designs has hired part-time help to sift through hundreds of e-mails received each week that include both orders and requests for catalogs .
By next month , the company hopes to have secure transaction capability on the site , which should streamline the process .
`` The business we 've done far outweighs the costs we 've put into it , '' said Dashiell .
An added benefit are the thousands of new names and addresses generated for the company 's catalog mailing list .
The Dashiells started the site after being approached by CityOnline , their Emeryville-based Internet service provider , to work together on an online store .
Although they had never even surfed the Web before , `` We understood this was the kind of real estate this was too good to pass up , '' said Dashiell .
Startup costs totaled $ 800 and the company pays a $ 100 quarterly service fee for the site .
_ Tara Thralls Designs ( & LR ; www.tiedyes.com & LR ; ) has tapped into the massive Grateful Dead Web culture with its tie-dyed T-shirts , spiral-rainbow mousepads and other hippie paraphernalia .
The site has helped even out the seasonal ebb and flow of the Point Reyes Station-based business , a small cabin on Highway 1 that relies heavily on summer and weekend beach traffic .
During the winter , Web sales can account for 20 percent of the company 's total revenues , said Tara Thralls , who owns the business and runs it with her two daughters , Star and Patty .
Tiedyes.com has also allowed Thralls to mine the wallets of Deadheads as far away as Egypt , Australia , Malaysia and Finland .
Since launching the site in 1995 , her single largest sale has been a $ 5,000 order from a Japanese hippie .
Thralls , who designed and maintains the vividly colored site herself , has spent about $ 500 on software and photos , plus an $ 80 start-up fee and $ 30 monthly fees to her Internet service provider .
`` The site has paid for itself 10 times over , '' Thralls said .
Sales have slowly picked up since Thralls redesigned the site a year and a half ago , turning it from a simple home page with two photos into an extensive site with dozens of pages and hundreds of links to related sites .
Thralls credits much of Tiedyes.com 's success to its self-explanatory domain name , which makes it easy for Web surfers to find .
`` Tiedye.com '' and `` Tiedyed.com '' were already taken when she applied for a name three years ago .
`` When I saw ` Tiedyes.com ' was free , I got chills , '' she said .
`` I knew how big the Internet would be . ''
Thralls relies on Web search engines and word of mouth to generate traffic to the site .
She has registered Tiedyes.com , as well as common misspellings of the word `` tie dye , '' with major search engines .
She said she plans to register other search words such as `` hippie '' and `` counterculture . ''
When she can afford it , Thralls said , she would like to add the capacity to handle secure credit card orders and run banner ads on other sites .
