Zambian Minister Warns against Job Loss
LUSAKA , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- About 19,000 jobs will be lost and Zambia 's economy distorted greatly if the country 's finance ministry does not reduce excise duty quickly on soft drinks to avert an impending closure of Zambia Bottlers .
Enock Kavindele , Zambian Minister of Commerce , Trade and Industry , warned here Sunday .
He told a press conference that his ministry has informed the Finance Ministry that the current 25 percent excise duty on carbonated drinks is not viable and recommended that it be reduced to five percent .
If the Finance Ministry does not promptly address the case of Zambia Bottlers , the manufacturers of Coca Cola products in the country , Zambia 's economy risks getting greatly impaired , he noted .
According to him , Zambia Bottlers should not be looked upon as an individual company but from the perspective of its contribution to the Zambian economy .
This matter must be responded promptly because the complaints received from Zambia Bottlers are very valid , he said .
" We do not look at Zambia Bottlers as a company but at its contribution to the economy , " he said .
Kavindele said many companies do business with Zambia Bottlers and if the latter is closed , about 19,000 jobs will be lost in Zambia and the economy will be greatly distorted .
" The impending closure of Coca Cola in Zambia will have a domino effect on our economy .
The company consumes 25 percent of Zambian sugar worth 4.4 billion Kwacha ( about 2.2 million U.S. Dollars ) and also pays 186 million Kwacha ( 93,000 Dollars ) in electricity bills , he said .
If Coca Cola closes down , Zambia will not only lose investment opportunities but also business confidence , he said .
In May this year the government promised to reduce duty on Coca Cola for Zambia Bottlers , which has not been honored up to now , forcing the company to increase the price of its products from 500 to 900 Kwacha .
The increased price has inevitably slumped the demand for the products while retailers in some border areas have started importing soft drinks from neighboring countries .
