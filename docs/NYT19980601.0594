WASHINGTON _ Jim Williams , the St. Simons Island , Ga. native who has been in jail in Ecuador for 20 months , has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida on charges he was part of a cocaine smuggling operation , according to an indictment made public Monday .
His family in Georgia welcomed the news as a glimmer of hope that he soon would return to the United States , even if it is to stand trial .
`` We begged them to indict Jim because we thought it was the only way to get a fair trial , '' Charlie Williams , a St. Simons Island restaurateur and brother of Jim Williams , said .
Williams , whose cause has been taken up by former President Jimmy Carter and members of Congress , was named in three counts of a six-count indictment .
It described an alleged drug trafficking and money laundering ring led by Jose Castrillon , a Colombian from whom Williams bought fish for his Jacksonville , Fla. importing company .
The grand jury in Tampa , Fla. also indicted Castrillon and 14 other people .
Rep. Jack Kingston ( R-Ga . ) , one of several members of Congress who have questioned Williams ' treatment in Ecuador , said the indictment should lead to his extradition .
`` In the U.S. , he would receive a fair and timely trial , '' Kingston said .
Members of Congress also have questioned the circumstances of Williams ' arrest in Ecuador in September 1996 , a month after a Drug Enforcement Administration official told his counterparts in Ecuador that Williams was part of Castrillon 's alleged drug ring .
Williams ' wife , Robin , said he was arrested in Ecuador to pressure him to testify against Castrillon .
