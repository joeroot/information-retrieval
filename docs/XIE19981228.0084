Vinegar Promotes Good Health
TAIYUAN , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese medical experts recently completed a study proving the efficacy of vinegar for softening blood vessels , reducing swelling and fat levels in the blood , and enriching vital energy .
The analysis revealed that vinegar contains 18 kinds of free amino acids , including eight of which human organs are unable to synthesize .
Septuagenarian Liu Zhengming , from north China 's Shanxi Province , worked in a vinegar distillery some 30 years ago and claims he has never suffered from influenza .
Workers at the Qingxu Vinegar Distillery , the largest of its kind in China , have been free of any form of cancer or heart disease for many decades .
Shanxi is famous throughout China for its long history of vinegar production , including the popular Laochencu brand .
Contemporary local residents consume vinegar a beverage , rather than resorting to the past practice of using the product simply as a flavoring .
Famous brand vinegars contain a dozen nutritious ingredients , including honey , haw ( hawthorn berries ) and dates .
Drinking vinegar on regular basis helps lower blood pressure , invigorate the functions of both the spleen and stomach , and improves looks .
Shanxi residents began producing vinegar as early as the 12 century B.C. , with most local families continuing the tradition even today .
Vinegar production has emerged as a pillar industry in recent years , with some 100-odd state and collective plants currently 50 product lines .
Shanxi exports vinegar products to a number of countries and regions .
People from throughout the country trek to Shanxi to buy Laochencu .
