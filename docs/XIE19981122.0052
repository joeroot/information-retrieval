Israel , Palestinians Urged to Resolve Prisoner
JERUSALEM , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- As Israel and the Palestinians were fiercely disputing over the release of Palestinian prisoners , U.S. officials stepped in Sunday and urged the two sides to resolve the difference themselves .
The U.S. did not see any violation of the land-for-peace deal by Israel to include 150 common criminals in the 250 prisoners who were released last Friday as called upon by the accord , said a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv .
The statement came after the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) complained to Washington over the weekend that , by releasing criminal prisoners instead of political prisoners , Israel breached a verbal agreement the two sides reached during the negotiations last month in the U.S ..
Palestinian officials said Israel had agreed in the talks that a total of 750 Palestinian prisoners to be released in three stages would be political prisoners , those taking part in resistant movement against Israel .
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat has sent letters of complaint to Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross over the issue .
Palestinian Security Chief Mohammed Dahlan called the release " an insult to the Palestinian people " and " the most dangerous step taken by Israel " since the signing of the peace deal last month .
For its part , Israel insisted that it had never agreed to release " members of terrorist organizations " and those " with blood on their hands . "
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a weekly cabinet meeting Sunday that he had promised PNA President Yasser Arafat during the U.S. summit talks to release only 100 " security prisoners , " or political prisoners as called by the Palestinians .
Palestinian officials said that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has promised to bring up the matter with the Israelis in time for the next prisoner release , expected in four weeks .
She made the pledge in a telephone conversation with Arafat last Friday , during which Arafat raised the issue to her , the officials said .
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is expected to meet early this week with Arafat 's deputy Mahmoud Abbas on the issue .
However , the Palestinians have expressed their satisfaction with Israel 's implementation of the first stage of further withdrawal from the West Bank last Friday as agreed upon in the land-for-peace deal .
Israel turned over 2 percent of the West Bank under its full control to joint jurisdiction with the Palestinians and transferred another 7.1 percent under joint control into fully Palestinian-run areas .
