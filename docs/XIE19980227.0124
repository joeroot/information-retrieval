Dutch Skipper Wins Second Place in Round-the-World Race
CANBERRA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Dutch skipper Roy Heiner fought back from the sixth place to finish second in the fifth leg of the Whitbread Round-the-World Race on Friday .
His Brunel Sunergy completed the 6,670 miles more than three days behind Paul Cayard 's EF Language .
However the second-place finish was still a big victory for Heiner 's crew which recorded two last places , and two next-to-last places in the previous four legs .
Heiner said his decision to go to the east of the Falkland Islands after rounding Cape Horn was the key for Brunel Sunergy to reap from sixth to second .
