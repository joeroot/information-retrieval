Manila , IMF Agree on Philippines ' 1999 Deficit Target
MANILA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The Philippine government and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) have agreed to set a 67 billion peso ( 1.67 billion U.S. dollar ) budget deficit target for the Philippines next year to enable the country 's economy to grow by 3.5 percent .
Making the announcement here over the weekend , Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the deficit spending would be financed primarily by foreign borrowings , and from the international capital market , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral sources of funding .
The government is committed to avoiding any pressure on Treasury bills so that if there is any need to borrow domestically , it can do away with the additional 22 billion peso ( 550 million dollars ) expenditures for next year , Espiritu said .
The Philippine government had initially fought against a higher budget deficit .
If a higher deficit means domestic borrowing , it said , that would result in higher lending rates based on higher T-bill rates as the government 's financial sources come primarily from the issuance of T-bills .
According to Espiritu , the IMF has agreed that the government would maintain its policy of keeping lending rates down , and source its financing externally and through multilaterals and bilaterals .
However , he said , the government may be ready to tap the international capital market early next year through the issuance of 1 billion dollars of global bonds .
