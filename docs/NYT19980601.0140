& HT ; ( -- -- - Please call or fax for a price quote . ) & HT ; By JOE APPLEGATE ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & HT ; It is 5 a.m. on Father 's Day , and you have decisions to make .
Do you lie quietly and wait for your children to come tumbling in with their annual offerings of gratitude and affection , their homemade cards , fund-raiser tie clips and bad cologne ?
& HT ; Or do you sneak out for a quick nine holes before anyone 's the wiser ?
& HT ; You turn and in the dimness can just make out the sleeping face of your wife .
You ask yourself where in the world you would be without her .
& HT ; Myrtle Beach ?
& HT ; Naah !
This is where you belong , you tell yourself angrily .
You dope !
A wife and children , good health , a steady job _ be honest with yourself , you sorry hacker , would you trade them for anything on this planet ?
Would you ?
& HT ; You choke back a tear .
& HT ; Yes !
Tiger Woods ' swing .
& HT ; Again , wearily , you try to imagine playing golf for a living , having a job where you don n't have to answer a phone , phone in an answer , estimate budget figures , figure budget estimates or budget estimated figures while answering the phone .
& HT ; You are not so naive as to think that professional golfers don n't hate their jobs sometimes .
And yet , try as you might , you can not imagine Woods telling himself that if he can just finish the back nine by 5 o ' clock he might be able to wedge in a quick staff meeting before dinner .
& HT ; OK , dude , you tell yourself , that 's enough for one morning , get a grip .
Back to reality _ and a good , sane reality it is .
You 've got some blessings to count : & HT ; + A wife who accepts your form of folly and who gets her exercise hauling heavy packages around shopping malls .
You both carry your own bags .
& HT ; + Kids who can be induced to come and play golf with you _ even if it is for a price .
You control the bets , however , and every penny you have to pay out is worth it .
The expression on a kid 's little face when a 20-foot putt is worth 20 bucks is priceless .
& HT ; + Your own good sense , when all is said and done , in knowing when to go for the greens and when to lay back , as now , in bed .
& HT ; There are those Sundays when a full round of golf is a natural , healthy choice .
Is there any better alternative to the stupor of the Super Bowl than a bracing round of golf on a deserted course , even a snowy one ?
& HT ; And then there are those Sundays when abandoning your family to play golf is maybe just a little bit sick .
Father 's Day is one , Mother 's Day definitely another .
& HT ; So today , of all days , it 's best to be still and enjoy your status as father .
Maybe one day your kid , interviewed after winning a tournament and a big check on Father 's Day , will smile at the camera , wave and shout , `` I love you , Dad ! ''
_ just the way Woods did on Mother 's Day , except , of course , that he said , `` I love you , Mom ! ''
& HT ; And just think how popping proud you 'll be that Father 's Day , watching it all on your VCR after coming in from your late-afternoon round .
