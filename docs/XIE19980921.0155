Meteorologists Looking For More Accurate Snow Forecasts
XINING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Meteorologists from northwest China 's Qinghai Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region started their discussion today to seek better ways to forecast snowstorms on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau .
The gathering of meteorologists every autumn has helped forecast snowstorms on the plateau region in 1992 , 1995 , and 1997 .
Ma Lin , head of the Qinghai Meteorology Bureau , says that the cooperation of meteorologists from Qinghai and Tibet is expected to make forecasts more accurate .
The comprehensive analysis of sun spots , marine temperatures , air currents , and radiation of the sun will help correct forecast of snowstorms , which in turn will help relief work , experts say .
In the past , there was only one heavy snowstorm every decade in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau , but there has been one heavy or moderate snowstorm every three years in recent years , resulting in heavy losses , sources from the symposium said .
