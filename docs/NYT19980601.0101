AUTHOR-GIBBONS _ For authors , landing a spot on Oprah 's Book Club is akin to winning a literary lottery .
Last fall , North Carolina writer Kaye Gibbons went from being a critically acclaimed author to best selling celebrity .
Since then , she has been besieged with phone calls and mail from writers who want to get in touch with Oprah , or who want Gibbons to do for them what she did for Charles Frazier .
As a result of the pressure , Gibbons suffered blinding migraines and insomnia , and in January threw out 900 pages of her own Civil War novel .
After weeks of around-the-clock rewriting , she finished `` On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon '' and is now on tour .
( O ' Briant , Atlanta Journal-Constitution )
MASTERP _ When `` I 've Got the Hook Up '' hits the top-ten list of box office receipts , many people ( most probably over 25 years old ) will scratch their heads wondering what the heck is a `` Master P '' ?
We provide the answer in a bright , explainer of just who this New Orleans rapper is and why he 's so incredibly popular ( his video was No. 1 for weeks in sales selling more than 1 million copies , his albums don n't stay in the stores ) .
( Murray , Atlanta Journal-Constitution )

( Warner , Atlanta Journal-Constitution )
TECHNOBUDDY _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on Microsoft 's original schedule of June 25 .
The publicity about the company 's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping sales .
After all , most home users will figure a program that attracts so many headlines must be danged important .
So my job today is to urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first month or so .

CYBERSCENE02 _ Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers and the Internet on a daily basis , Web sites do a much better job of representing the non-technical side of life .
Take fishing , for instance .
You 'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area ; tell you about the hottest lures ; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well .
( Husted , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) ( l , f ) MOVED
MACREPORT _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing software developers back to the Macintosh .
It is they who will make or break this computer .
With useful , entertaining and progressive software , the Mac will thrive again .
It won n't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the platform .
Without developer support , the Mac will be like a jilted suitor , all dressed up with nowhere to go .
( Haddad , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) ( l , f ) MOVED
TECHREPORT02 _ It 's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of compact discs , pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for , pop it into the CD player and hit play .
But wouldn n't it be nice to just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing ?
You can , if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player .
( Kanell , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) ( l , f ) MOVED
TECHTOOLS-COLUMN02 _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer programs , with more than 1 million copies sold .
It is an excellent program , but my wife , Donna , the genealogist , believes much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs that come with the deluxe version .
( Warner , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) ( l , f ) MOVED
CONSUMERWATCH _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct mail and telemarketing lists ?
There are many ways , easy ways , to get on the lists .
To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so simple .
( Tharpe , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) ( l , f ) MOVED
MONEYTALK02 _ A report last week from an educational trade association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of the cost of college tuition .
But a second look shows that we actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just tuition _ of a year in college .
The American Council on Education 's study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages $ 3 , 111 .
In a telephone poll , respondents guessed an average of $ 9 , 694 .
That guess is not far off from the total cost , including tuition , books , room and board , transportation and other expenses .
According to the College Board , that total is $ 10 , 069 .

KABAT-COLUMN _ In my day , they were called scrapbooks .
They were bound with twine and had big , black pages .
You used Elmer 's Glue , those little triangular picture tabs and a white pencil to write your captions .
Now , they 're called Memory Books .
Having just compiled one for our newly graduated high schooler , let me assure you , I made some memories .
