Indonesian Police Studying Possible Legal Violations
JAKARTA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesia 's State Police Sunday admitted they are studying for possible legal violations in the case of student demonstrations .
But the police refused to confirm a probe into Hariyadi Dharmawan , a signatory to a joint communique offering formation of a government presidium .
A group of 17 people Thursday issued a joint communique calling for the establishment of a Provisional People 's Consultative Assembly and eventually a presidium which would serve as a provisional government .
The joint communique signed by among others Kemal Idris , leader of National Front opposition group , and Sukmawati Sukarnoputri , the youngest daughter of founding president Soekarno .
" I won n't comment on individuals , but in general the police are studying the problem by collecting information to reach a conclusion on what had really happened , " Chief of the State Police 's Information Service Brig. Gen. Togar M. Sianipar said .
If the study shows that certain parties are found guilty in the case , the police would take further measures against them , Sianipar told Antara News Agency .
Students have been at the forefront of protests the whole week , demanding that the People 's Consultative Assembly , the highest legislative body , institute deeper political reform .
A number of recent incidents occurring in different places have led to anarchic actions , Sianipar said , citing looting and destruction at the Senen shopping center in Central Jakarta .
About a dozen shops and banks were looted , torched or pelted with stones in various parts of the city Saturday .
It was reported that the Jakarta Police now seized 40 persons suspected of looting and setting fire for questioning .
In response to a question on certain parties masterminding various actions , Sianipar said his side has in general identified them but it remained upholding the principle of the presumption of innocence .
