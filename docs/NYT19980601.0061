GREENACRES , Fla. _ It 's not easy being different _ just ask Al , the 2-year-old albino raccoon .
His blonde hair and light-colored eyes probably made him a little easier to spot than his dark-haired relatives , and trapper Ed Frederick caught him at the Falls Country Club here recently .
But being different and kind of cute may have saved Al , because instead of ending the raccoon 's life , Frederick will donate him to the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary .
`` Everything we 've come across , we 've never seen anything like it , '' said Frederick , who has operated Animal Trapping Unlimited for about five years .
Steve Coughlin , a wildlife biologist with the Game and Freshwater Fish Commission , said true and partial albinos are genetically different and are rare in animals , just as they are in humans .
`` Most often what you 'll see is a partial albino , which is still rare , '' he said .
`` Most albinos are not very healthy animals that don n't live much past birth . ''
But Al is full grown , with the teeth and somewhat wary disposition to prove it .
The raccoon has gotten used to his cage , Frederick said , but still hisses and grunts a little when people get too close .
`` It 's done OK out there on it 's own , and we 'd love to see the animal returned to the wild , but we have to abide by state rules , '' said Busch director David Hitzig , noting that state law does not allow trappers to catch a raccoon and release it elsewhere .
Busch is building a new facility in Jupiter and will provide a habitat for the raccoon .
Until the new center is finished , Hitzig will find temporary digs for Al .
`` We 'll give it a home , '' Hitzig said .
