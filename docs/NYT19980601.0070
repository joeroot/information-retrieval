RICHMOND HILL , Ga. _ Henry Ford , billionaire titan of the Industrial Age , once found 1,800 acres ' worth of tranquillity along the shores of the Ogeechee River outside Savannah .
Now , a group of developers hopes those same acres will offer vacation homes , as well as chic and sporty diversion to new Wall Street millionaires of the Technology Age .
Construction on the first houses is expected to begin in mid-June , pending approval by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development .
Variously called Dublin Plantation , Sterling Bluff and Richmond Plantation , the property now renamed the Ford Plantation will be the first development of its kind in the Savannah area .
A group of South Carolina investors called Sterling Bluff Associates is positioning it as the Bar Harbor of the South or the Ocean Reef Club of Georgia , offering second or third homes and presumably attracting families of wealth and station similar to those that frequent the Maine and Key Largo , Fla. , resorts .
`` There are only so many people that fit that profile .
Buyers will either add this to their list of destinations , or forsake an existing resort for this ...
( but ) it sounds like it would sell , '' remarked Eric Kennedy , editor of the duPont Registry , a magazine catering to buyers of million-dollar residences .
The developers include co-managing directors Steve Schram and Peter Pollak .
Schram is the agent for Sterling Bluff Associates , which was incorporated March 19 in Hilton Head , S.C .
Along with a third director , Chip Dolan , he and Pollak plan to take the Georgia plantation _ which predates the Revolutionary War _ and transform it into an exclusive , guarded-and-gated , $ 400 million vacation community with 385 houses and amenities compatible with a four-star to five-star resort .
These features include a 261-acre Pete Dye golf course and 248 acres of freshwater lakes , some of which are former rice ponds .
Targeting youthful , active executives , both male and female , who still perhaps have children at home , developers say they will offer a deep-water marina equipped with slips for large yachts , along with the following :
_ Stables , a paddock and eight miles of waterfront trails
_ Fishing and swimming
_ Squash , tennis and a spa .
_ A full-time naturalist and field guide ; fishing expert ; riding instructor ; massage therapists ; and nutritionist
_ An executive chef and a director of operations to oversee food service , limited lodging for residents ' guests and hospitality .
The centerpiece is the 9,000-square-foot Georgian house that Detroit automobile magnate Ford and his wife moved from Savannah , restored and visited between 1937 and 1947 .
A farm-style plantation house , a paddock and oddities _ such as the oyster house where Henry Ford entertained his cronies _ sit nearby under canopies of 17th - century live oak trees .
There are unrestricted views for miles around , provided in part by federally protected marshes flanking the river .
The developers already have passed muster for yacht-slip permits , said Stuart Stevens , a marine ecologist based in Brunswick .
The initial 200 or so lots to be developed will consist of two to six acres and will cost between $ 275,000 and $ 1 million .
That 's before building begins .
The developers themselves will build _ using an in-house architectural and construction outfit _ 185 others .
To come are `` golf cottages '' starting at $ 575,000 and `` marina houses '' ranging from $ 600,000 to more than $ 1 million .
Residents will pay , noted Pollak and Schram during a recent interview , a one-time initial membership fee of $ 75,000 to partake of all the activities .
The developers purchased the site for a reported $ 47 million .
The seller was a holding company , InterRedec , once connected to Ghaith Pharaon , the Saudi Arabian businessman .
In 1992 , Pharaon was indicted in federal court in Georgia on fraud and racketeering charges related to the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International .
Pharaon is currently a fugitive , said a spokesman for the U.S. attorney 's office in Atlanta
However , during his heyday as a Georgia-based banker and deal-maker , Pharaon bought the Ford estate .
Around 1981 he set about restoring the house , festooning it with tassels , palm trees and European statuary .
He put in the golf course .
He commissioned a coffee-table book , `` The View From Sterling Bluff , '' describing the property and his role in saving it .
Although the book is now being used as a marketing tool , Pollak said Pharaon and his family are no longer involved with the Ford Plantation .
Pollak and Dolan are South Carolina resort-real-estate salesmen and managers .
Pollack and Schram , a former Morgan Stanley investment banker and former co-chairman of the Boston Celtics Limited Partnership , were vague as to the number of investors they have .
`` You can say it is something under 50 handpicked individuals , '' Pollak said .
Meanwhile , how does Old Savannah feel about tomorrow 's view from Sterling Bluff ?
Sarah Moore Barto , whose family has lived along the Southeastern coast for generations , does not like the idea at all .
`` First , it was Hilton Head , then Daufuskie Island ( that were overdeveloped ) .
I am getting personally weary of people coming in from the outside and using us to make money .
We have been overwhelmed , '' Barto said .
`` We have lost so much of the true South , '' she continued , `` ( and ) every time we try to control it , to live peacefully and let them do business , they ruin it .
It has gotten so out of hand . ''
Whatever the Ford Plantation project brings in its wake remains to be seen .
But with its amenities , it is expected to appeal to younger families , well-heeled by Wall Street in a boom economy .
Said the duPont Registry 's Kennedy : `` You are talking about people with average annual incomes of $ 600,000 to $ 700 , 000 .
There are more millionaires roaming around our country than ever , and many of them are being made by their mid-40s ...
I can visualize 9 - or 10-year-old children running around this place . ''
