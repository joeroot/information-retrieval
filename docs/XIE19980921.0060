IOC Comes Is Opposite Super League Plans
BRUSSELS , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The International Olympic Committee would not support the plan to create a European Super League , arguing it would monopolize income at the expense of smaller clubs .
An IOC delegation headed by President Juan-Antonio Samaranch told European Union officials the lucrative television deals planned under the super league would not profit soccer as a whole .
" This is why a project like the Super League would be dangerous since it would concern a select club of top teams and the money they would generate would not trickle down to the provincial clubs , " said Jacques Rogge , the head of the European Olympic Committees .
" Our point is that the collective negotiations of television rights is the only way to let money filter through from the top level of sports to the grassroots , " Rogge said .
The IOC called on the EU 's Executive Commission to make sure an equitable system of revenue distribution continues to exist .
