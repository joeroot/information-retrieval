Nigerian Leader Vows to End Communal Clashes
LAGOS , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Nigerian leader General Abdulsalami Abubakar has vowed to bring a final resolution of bloody communal clashes in parts of the country by the end of the year .
Abubakar made the assurance Wednesday in Ibadan after attending the 50th anniversary of the University of Ibadan , according to local media reports .
" We shall try to mediate to ensure that peace returns to these areas , " he said .
He said it is very unfortunate that brothers and sisters who have been living together peacefully for many years are killing one another .
The government has resolved to solve the problems in these areas once and for all , he added .
Communal clashes between different ethnic groups have led to huge loss of lives and properties in several parts of Nigeria in recent times .
In the southwestern state of Osun , the relocation of the Ife East Local Government has sparked off continued clashes between the Ife and Modakeke peoples since last August .
In Delta State , the relocation of the Warri South Local Government caused bloody clashes between the Ijaw and Itshekiri peoples in late October , resulting in scores of deaths and torching of many houses .
As communal clashes spread , some people accused the military government of deliberately ignoring them so as to creat barriers to the success of the ongoing transition to civil rule program .
