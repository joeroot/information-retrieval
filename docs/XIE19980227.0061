Canada to Crack Down on Underground Economy
OTTAWA , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The Canadian government plans to crack down on the underground economy again , beginning with the construction industry , reports said Thursday .
Revenue Canada , the federal tax-collecting agency , is expected to begin consultations soon with construction industry so the government can track down millions of dollars in lost revenue .
As part of its new moves , the agency wants to make it mandatory for companies dealing with contractors to report once a year details on whom they hired and how much they paid .
The construction industry said it generally supports the effort to make reporting mandatory , but wants to make sure that small and medium-sized companies are not saddled with an expensive , cumbersome system .
It is difficult to measure the size of Canada 's underground economy , the reports said .
But Revenue Canada has managed to collect more than 2.3 billion dollars ( 1.6 billion USD ) in additional tax since the end of 1993 , only using its voluntary disclosure and audits .
Apart from construction , the agency has also identified serious problems in the auto sales and repair industry , jewellery sales and the hospitality industry .
