Feature : Weddings Under Sanctions
BAGHDAD , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- For 24-year-old Kamil Fatima , the biggest dream is to live a peaceful life with neither war nor sanctions .
" War can destroy our houses , sanctions can make us poor , but they can not deprive us the right to survive , " the newly-wed Iraqi young woman told Xinhua .
Fatima and her bridegroom Adela were among dozens of newlyweds at Baghdad 's Hilton Hotel , at the riverside of Tigris , on Thursday evening .
The custom remains : the Iraqis still hold weddings on Thursday , Muslims ' weekend .
But the ceremonies are much simpler than before .
Eight years of sanctions , imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , have damaged the life of the Iraqi people in almost all respects , and among others , the matrimony of youngsters .
Many young people can not get married because they can not afford the wedding expense .
Ahamad Ali and his wife were among the couples present at the night .
" I might have got married earlier if there is no sanctions .
Although I often moonlighted after work , I still could not afford the wedding expense and my wedding date had been postponed for several times , " Ali said .
Working as a clerk , his salary was 6,400 Iraqi dinars ( about four U.S. dollars ) a month .
" I borrowed money for the wedding , my suit and my wife 's wedding dress are all rented , " he said .
Before the sanctions , many Iraqis used to hold luxurious weddings at five-star hotels , inviting bands and famous singers to the banquets to add to the fun , according to the hotel 's reception manager .
The newlyweds usually lived at least one week in the hotels during their honeymoons , some rich people even stayed for one month .
Due to the sanctions , the number of such hotel weddings fell sharply .
One night in the hotel cost a couple about 9,000 dinars ( six dollars ) for room renting , almost equivalent to two months ' income for ordinary Iraqis .
More and more young couples have to hold their banquets at home and spend just one night in hotels .
Many poor families could not even afford to hold weddings for their children .
Although the newlyweds were happy during honeymoon , they were at a loss for their future life under the sanctions .
