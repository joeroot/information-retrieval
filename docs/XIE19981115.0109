Malaysian ambassador to China Dato ' Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan was also present on the occasion to see Jiang off .
Sources say that Jiang will deliver an important speech at the meeting to expound China 's stance and propositions on such major topics as the efforts to overcome the Asian financial crisis , resume economic growth and strengthen international financial system .
In addition , Jiang will also have a wide-ranging exchange of opinions and views with leaders of other APEC members on bilateral ties , relevant questions of the APEC and the international and regional situation .
In another development , China has decided to simplify , as of today , protocol arrangements for seeing off and greeting the country 's Communist Party and state leaders on their visits abroad .
The decision said the send-off and welcoming ceremonies for China 's top Party and state leaders will be held at the Great Hall of the People , and the number of senior officials attending these ceremonies will be reduced accordingly .
