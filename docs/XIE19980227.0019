Gold Industry to Shed 100,000 Jobs This Year
JOHANNESBURG , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Up to 100,000 workers in the gold mining industry could be retrenched this year , the National Union of Mine-workers ( NUM ) said at a two-day gold summit which was opened here Thursday .
Opening the summit aimed at finding solutions to the mass job losses in the industry , NUM President James Motlatsi said planned down-sizing of gold mines would bring the number of people laid off in the industry since 1987 to about 400 , 000 , South African Press Association reported .
More than 300 delegates from the country 's major mining companies , the government and the NUM , which accounts for almost 70 percent of the unionized work force in gold and coal mines in the gold-rich country , are attending the summit .
The meeting was called by the union to try to halt job losses in the industry which has been hit hard by the slumping gold price .
About 30,000 workers were laid off last year and in January alone 500 workers were laid off each day .
Motlatsi said the crisis has national and international dimensions .
He said many people seemed to underscore mining and gold 's central role in South Africa 's economy and therefore failed to realize the crisis ' impact on the country and the region as a whole .
The NUM called for a minimum 12-month moratorium on retrenchments while solutions were being sought , the speedy implementation of a social plan that would cater for retrenched worker , state assistance to marginal mines and new regulations to control retrenchments .
However , the Chamber of Mines , the employers ' organization of the mining industry , said that there is little leeway at the moment due to the sharp drop in the gold price .
It said the key issue is rather to alleviate the position of the laid-off workers .
The gold mining industry is in a state of crisis worldwide with the gold price at a 16-year low .
South Africa is the largest gold producer in the world , with a 23 percent share of the world 's total gold production in 1995 .
Its gold exports accounted for 40 percent of the country 's total exports .
