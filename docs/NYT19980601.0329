RISING TIDE GOES OUT , LEAVING McCLINTON HIGH AND DRY ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By DAVE FERMAN c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Delbert McClinton says it plainly , and several times in the course of a brief phone interview from Nashville : His heart is broken .
`` I was riding a wave of exultation I had never known , '' he said .
`` It was looking like I had a record that was going to break through , and in a heartbeat it was all gone . ''
`` It '' is Rising Tide , the offshoot of Universal Records that , last fall , released McClinton 's exceptional `` One of the Fortunate Few '' CD , easily one of the best in the 57-year-old 's storied career .
`` One of the Fortunate Few '' features cameos from B.B .
King , Lyle Lovett , John Prine , Vince Gill , Mavis Staples , Patty Loveless and Lee Roy Parnell , among others , and some of McClinton 's finest singing .
Released last fall , it picked up strong reviews and healthy sales .
Then , a little over two months ago , Rising Tide was no more .
Universal pulled the plug on the label , which means no more promotion and precious little distribution .
Literally overnight , `` One of the Fortunate Few '' went from a hot blues / rock / country CD to a lame duck .
And with it went McClinton 's chances of capitalizing , at least for the time being , on his past successes , which include a 1992 Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Duo ( with Bonnie Raitt , for `` Good Man , Good Woman '' ) .
`` My wife called me and said , ` You better sit down , ' '' he said of the day he got the news .
`` I thought somebody had died .
She told me the company had folded , and I was speechless .
We had had a marketing meeting three days before .
People are telling me it 's not in the stores _ and all the marketing ceased to exist , you know ?
It 's a very sad thing .
I 'm as proud of this record as anything I 've ever done . ''
As he should be .
McClinton has been one of America 's best roadhouse rockers for more than a quarter-century , but since 1973's `` Victim of Life 's Circumstances '' ( on which he wrote every tune ) he has let the songwriting go , preferring to fill CDs with cover versions .
Mainly , he says , this was because for years his life was a big mess : There was a lot of hard traveling , a lot of work and little money .
Also , he notes , four different labels ( Clean , ABC , Capricorn and the Muscle Shoals Sound arm of Capitol ) went out of business , while he was on them .
By the mid - '80s he was disenchanted and `` abusing myself pretty good _ my career was in disarray . ''
Then , in 1985 , he met his would-be wife , Wendy , ( the two wed in 1996 ) and she helped him turn his life around .
The juices started flowing again , and he made a strong showing on 1992's `` Never Been Rocked Enough . ''
`` I prefer to write positive songs , '' he said .
`` I don n't want to write from the heartbreak I 've felt .
I 've been through it and I know how to do it , but I prefer irreverent , funky songs .
I write to please me and that 's all . ''
In this way , `` One of the Fortunate Few '' is a standout effort : McClinton co-wrote seven of the CD 's 10 songs with producer / guitarist Gary Nicholson and others , including Donnie Fritts .
And these songs _ `` Somebody to Love You , '' `` Monkey Around , '' `` You Were Never Mine , '' `` Lie No Better '' _ are the CD 's best cuts .
`` I 'd just been writing for years and I had a stack of ' em _ we were ready , '' he said .
`` We could say , ` Which ones do we leave out ? ' Which is a nice place to be .
We didn n't have to hunt for songs . ''
McClinton is also proud of how many people volunteered to be on the CD .
Almost every song features a guest artist , and among the best are Parnell ( whose great slide work is on two songs ) and King , who solos on `` Leap of Faith . ''
`` I was on tour with him two years ago , and I gave him a tape of the song , '' McClinton said .
`` He loved it , and when the tour came to Nashville he put his part on it .
There 's nothing more important in the world than having friends , and I have a lot of ' em .
The fact that everyone made time for this is phenomenal . ''
So now what ?
McClinton doesn n't know .
He 's still signed to Universal , and says guardedly that `` we 're trying to negotiate a position I can deal with . ''
But for now , `` One of the Fortunate Few '' is one great CD that isn n't getting nearly the attention it deserves .
Delbert McClinton has been down this road before _ and he 's not giving up .
`` I felt snakebit for a long time , '' he said .
`` But I know better _ I 'm not my own worst enemy anymore .
A lot of it is just being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
The title of my first album was `` Victim of Life 's Circumstances '' and it rings true .
But I 'll get through it _ I 'm not going away . ''
