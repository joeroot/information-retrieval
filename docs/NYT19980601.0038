RUN OF BULLS NOT OVER
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By PETER MAY c.1998 The Boston Globe
CHICAGO _ They have never had to fight so long , so hard , and , at times , so futilely , simply to take the next step .
Their warts and blemishes exposed for all the world to see , their swagger reduced at times to juvenile behavior , the world champion Bulls nevertheless have earned the right to defend their title .
They did so Sunday night with a day-at-the-dentist , 88 - 83 victory over an Indiana Pacers team that probably deserved a better fate .
The NBA Finals open Wednesday night in Salt Lake City and no one who witnessed Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals at the United Center could have not felt that in another time or place , it would have been Larry Bird preparing his team for the Utah Jazz .
`` I can n't say the best team won , '' said Scottie Pippen in what , for the Bulls , was a rare moment of humility .
For most of this series , they have acted like petulant adolescents when they lost and imperious blackguards when they won .
`` I have a lot of respect for Indiana .
They gave us a lot .
I feel both teams deserve to go to the Finals . ''
But only one will , of course , and that one is the same one that has represented the East six times in the 1990s .
The Bulls labored through this one , looking a lot like some of those Celtics teams in the 1980s that simply found a way to win when everything appeared to be pointing to a loss .
Chicago shot 38 percent from the field and 59 percent from the line .
Messiah Michael Jordan went 9 for 25 from the field and bricked five free throws .
Pippen was 6 of 18 .
Luc Longley made a single basket .
`` It wasn n't a great game , '' said Chicago coach Phil Jackson .
But the victory was forged by will and aggression .
The Bulls got the loose balls .
The Bulls got the loose ( and tight ) calls .
And the Bulls dominated in one category that jumped out from the final box score : rebounding .
Chicago outrebounded the Pacers , 50 - 34 , but the real whopper was on the offensive boards , where the Bulls collected 22 to the Pacers ' four .
That not only led to a 24 - 6 difference in second-chance points , it also gave the Bulls extra possessions and , by extension , time off the clock .
Down the stretch , that was almost as vital as scoring points .
`` It seemed like the little things beat us , '' Bird said .
`` The offensive rebounding just ripped our heart out . ''
Bird was on the other side of similar games in Boston , such as Game 7 against the Bucks in 1987 and Game 7 against the Lakers in 1984 .
The Celtics shot poorly in those games , but prevailed , in large part due to rebounding .
They also were the home team , which again proved to be an invaluable asset in a seventh game .
The Bulls needed everything to survive and there were moments where at least the fans might have wondered if this was , indeed , the end .
They started out terribly , yielding a 16 - 2 Indiana run that put them in a 13-point hole .
They got a 15-point second quarter from Jordan and survived some Reggie Miller heroics to lead by 3 at the half .
The lead was 4 entering the fourth , then the Pacers , to the astonishment of most of the 23,844 in attendance , regained the lead .
They did it without Miller , who had only one shot in the fourth quarter ( an airball ) and no field goals in the final 18 minutes .
He still led the Pacers with 22 points .
They did it without one-time heroes Travis Best and Jalen Rose , who were inconsistent Sunday night .
But they led , 73 - 68 , with 7 : 37 left and 79 - 77 after Antonio Davis powered over Pippen with 5 : 50 to play .
During that stretch , the Bulls went 4 : 20 without a point .
They had gotten help from a wide variety of sources , from Toni Kukoc ( 14 of his 21 in the third ) to Steve Kerr ( a huge 11 points ) to Jud Buechler ( 11 minutes , doubling his time for the first six games ) .
But they needed more .
`` I wasn n't worried , '' Jordan said .
`` At no time did I allow any negativity to enter my thought process . ''
At 79 - 77 , the Bulls started to close down on the Pacers the way one of those insect-devouring plants has its dinner .
The Pacers ' next seven possessions resulted in four turnovers , one missed shot , a Miller airball that Antonio Davis redirected , and two Rik Smits free throws .
Smits struggled all night with fouls ( he had five ) and shooting ( 3 of 7 ) , and lost a critical jump ball to Jordan in the fourth , tipping it the wrong way .
That led to a Kerr trey .
The Bulls tied the game at 79 on two Jordan free throws and took the lead for good on yet another second-chancer , this one by Pippen .
Longley then chose the right time for his only hoop , making it 83 - 79 .
The Bulls defense held on _ barely _ for the rest of the evening .
