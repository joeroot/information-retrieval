THE MILLENNIUM 'S LAST FASHION REVOLUTION ( JT )
By AMY M. SPINDLER c.1998 N.Y .

Flush fashion companies have thrown a lot of money at a lot of talented young designers in the last few years , setting them up at the ritzy labels that rule the duty-free shops .
All those beneficent companies are hoping for in return is a dinky little breakthrough like the one Tom Ford had at Gucci .
They would just like the kind of collection that , after it is shown , alters the eye and esthetic of the fashion-buying population , saturates editorial pages and has a look so resonant that even the interior-design market feels its influence .
Editors think it 's creative ; retailers think it 's commercial .
Customers think , `` Finally , those designers aren n't dressing me like a '' ( choose one or all ) `` schoolgirl / prostitute / nun / mom . ''
It 's no surprise that the companies haven n't found their Tom Ford yet .
In fact events seem to have conspired to make Ford the last big breakthrough designer that fashion is destined to have before the end of the millennium .
Which , if true , is very bad news .
The American market , at least , is as loaded as it was in the '80s , but no one seems to be able to find a revolutionary new talent to throw their money at .
The thing about a designer 's big breakthrough is that it can happen only once .
Designers can burst into public consciousness and change the way worldly women dress just one time .
Within 10 years they 've become part of the establishment , then they settle into that four-decade routine of building their reputation , rewarding expectations , boring their audience , then eventually parodying themselves .
It could be argued that the past 100 years have had only 10 really big breakthroughs , designers who came on the scene and immediately changed the esthetic of the fashionable , at high prices and at low .
In one startling season they transformed what women wanted to wear .
Any such list is subjective , but here 's one opinion : Poiret , Coco Chanel , Christian Dior , Courreges , Yves Saint Laurent , Halston , Claude Montana , Giorgio Armani , Donna Karan and Ford .
The staggered pacing of those breakthroughs makes it unlikely that before the millennium a new force will dictate another look for women .
And in many ways , the last big breakthrough of fashion , that of Ford in 1994 , has left a stylistic scorched earth for those who have followed him .
Ford has emerged as the ultimate fin-de-siecle designer .
It hasn n't been only his nihilistic esthetic , which has seemed so eloquently to speak for the sneering , bored end of the modern age .
It is how he 's been able to turn himself into the prototype of a designer for the next millennium , in which , with a new five-year contract at Gucci , he 's sure to continue his influence .
His is such a unified esthetic that it has seemed to put a veneer on the whole marketplace , a tough lacquer finish that no designer has been able to crack since .
What 's made Ford 's success so difficult to surpass or upstage _ a must for whoever has the inevitable next breakthrough _ was a unique set of circumstances .
Unlike those who had big breakthroughs before him , Ford was working for an established label with a history that meant something .
( Is there any designer who is going to make women want a dress with , for example , `` Byblos '' written across it ? ) He was able to lead with a men 's wear collection , then show the women 's collection that mirrored it , making it clear that this esthetic could dress everyone .
He had an advertising budget that allowed him to put the iconic vision of Amber Valetta flanked by two smoldering men in nearly every high-profile fashion magazine .
And he further underlined the look by , within one season , introducing complementary home furnishings and photographing his collections in the '70s - style modern stage sets that made mere clothes a lifestyle .
More than any designer before him , Ford was selling a mood .
And what he conveyed was more than the sum of its parts .
Too many of his contemporaries are selling parts , the sum of which is , frankly , parts .
`` Fashion is not just about clothes , especially today , '' Ford said last week .
`` Fashion is about attitude .
That 's what you 're marketing .
The product has to be there but on top of that you 're marketing hip , you 're marketing cool . ''
What he had in common with the other big breakthrough designers was his timing .
`` If those designers hadn n't hit on something at the time it was in the air , someone else would have , '' he said .
Ford decided to sell decadence at the peak of a particularly long-running minimalist moment that had swept fashion , turning even Chanel suits bland .
`` People had forgotten about sex , '' Ford said .
Or more accurately , when they were thinking of it , it conjured negative images .
`` If you remember what AIDS did to the world , it made sex something you weren n't supposed to have , '' Ford said .
`` What I wanted to do was bring back sexuality or sensuality we hadn n't seen as a mass culture in a long time . ''
Ford seduced the fashion editors by holding a mirror up to his audience at the shows , tapping into the jaded attitude of the jet-set fashion pack who had seen every trick played on the runway before , except that one .
By exposing their real feelings about fashion , fatigue , Ford has created a hostile environment for designers with a more exuberant vision .
The knowing worldliness of his clothes makes others look earnest by comparison .
And earnestness is a pejorative term in this era .
