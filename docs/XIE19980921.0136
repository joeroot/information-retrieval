Share Prices Drop to New 12-Year Low in Tokyo
TOKYO , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo Monday with the Nikkei index dropping to a new 12-year low after last Friday 's political compromise on restructuring the banking system showed signs of breakdown .
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange sank 385.82 points , or 2.76 percent , from Friday 's close to end at 13 , 597.30 , falling below the previous 12-and-a-half-year closing low of 13,859.14 set Thursday .
It was the Nikkei 's lowest close since February 28 , 1986 when it ended at 13,640.83 at the beginning of Japan 's asset-inflated bubble economy .
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index ( TOPIX ) , covering all First Section issues , lost 25.43 points or 2.37 percent to 1 , 047.79 .
Turnover on the major section decreased to an estimated 389 million shares from Friday 's 453.90 million shares .
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan ( LTCB ) was the day 's most heavily traded issue .
The steep decline was partly due to selling by domestic corporations to secure profits before they close their books for the April-September period , traders said .
But traders were most disappointed by the diverging opinions among political leaders which emerged over the weekend on how to handle the struggling LTCB .
While opposition party leaders are against using public fund to boost LTCB 's capital base , Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka , the top government spokesman , indicated Monday that this may happen .
The confusion sent bank shares falling hard , with the sector losing 3.44 percent .
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section , losers outnumbered gainers 956 to 217 , with 114 issues ending unchanged .
