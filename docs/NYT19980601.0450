TRAVELERS GROUP BUYS STAKE IN JAPAN 'S NIKKO

TOKYO _ The Travelers Group and the Nikko Securities Co. formally announced an agreement on Monday that will give the Wall Street powerhouse a 25 percent stake in Japan 's third-largest securities brokerage firm for $ 1.6 billion , a deal that immediately raised questions about how quickly the Japanese financial industry would consolidate .
The Travelers-Nikko alliance , which had been expected since reports of it first appeared here on Friday , came as Japan is undergoing a broad-based financial restructuring aimed at making its markets as flexible as those in New York and London by 2001 .
Japanese and foreign companies are exploring possible combinations that will help them better compete in this new arena , and in markets around the world .
`` The tie-up between Japanese financial institutions and foreign institutions will accelerate , '' said Yukiko Ohara , a bank analyst with SBC Warburg Japan Ltd. `` Japanese financial institutions need a good product .
They have a very strong client base , but they will lose clients if they have no tie-up . ''
The deal also raised concern among competitors and clients of the two companies .
For instance , the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi , until Monday the largest shareholder in Nikko with 3.1 percent , had envisioned forging its own Nikko alliance .
That is no longer a possibility , and a spokesman said on Monday that Bank of Tokyo would have to revise its strategy toward the securities business .
Nikko has been losing money and is considered poorly prepared to face the challenges of financial deregulation in Japan on its own .
But the partnership with Travelers , the parent of Salomon Smith Barney , will marry a savvy U.S. financial-services conglomerate to a formidable distribution network in a potentially lucrative Japanese market .
For Travelers , which has agreed to merge with Citicorp in a record $ 70 billion transaction , the deal with Nikko helps round out its vision of becoming the world 's leading diversified financial company , one that will some day be a household name in all major markets .
`` Our creating a partnership with Nikko will allow us to be more productive not only in this marketplace but all around the world , '' said Sanford Weill , the chairman of Travelers , at a joint news conference here on Monday with Masashi Kaneko , Nikko Securities ' president .
Kaneko said the world is witnessing `` the global consolidation of the financial industry . ''

The partners said that in January they would establish Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd. , a $ 1 billion joint venture that will trade securities , advise on mergers and acquisitions , underwrite stocks and bonds , and produce economic research .
Travelers will become Nikko 's largest shareholder and take the first seat by a foreign company on Nikko 's board .
In exchange , Travelers will purchase 9.5 percent of Nikko 's common stock for 70 billion yen _ about $ 507 million _ and a further 15.5 percent ownership interest in the form of convertible bonds , for 150 billion yen , or about $ 1.1 billion .
Nikko will spend between $ 72 million and $ 360 million buying up Travelers shares .
The deal raises the stakes for both foreign and domestic companies operating in Japan .
Some may begin to feel edged out of a changing financial playing field .
`` The number of potential brides , or marriage partners , drops down by one and there aren n't that many with the size of distribution network that Nikko has , '' said James Fiorillo , a financial analyst at ING Barings in Japan .
`` The effect of all this is that domestic firms are scrambling to react .
Foreign firms are scrambling .
And the number of potential partners is starting to fall dramatically . ''
Japan has as many as 200 brokerage houses , most of them small or medium-sized firms that have been comfortable under such regulatory practices as fixed commissions .
Many are expected to face enormous difficulties competing in a less-regulated marketplace .
Kaneko said on Monday that Nikko would be expanding its branch network , building small offices in many places .
He also said the bank would cut costs by disposing of physical assets and reducing fringe benefits and entertainment costs .
No layoffs will result , he said .
Although Travelers is taking only 49 percent ownership in the new joint venture , Nikko , which gets the rest , runs the risk of domination by its foreign partner .
Many ailing Japanese companies face the same risk as they strike alliances and partnerships with overseas firms primarily seeking a ready-made list of clients .
`` Nikko will run the risk of losing weight because the company will move its most promising areas of business , like investment banking business , to the new joint venture , '' said Yushiro Ikuyo , a financial analyst at Commerz Securities Japan , who formerly worked at Smith Barney here .
`` Nikko may end up becoming a marketing representative for Travelers ' financial products . ''
