GRANT SEEMS HEADED FOR TITLE SHOT
( mk ) By TIMOTHY W. SMITH c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
For all those who doubted that Michael Grant was the heir apparent to the current heavyweight champions , Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis , Grant showed his best against Obed Sullivan on Saturday night at the Atlantic City Convention Center .
Grant overcame an early cut over his left eye , took as much punishment as Sullivan could dish out and then prevailed over the former Marine when referee Tony Orlando stopped the bout at 2 minutes 16 seconds of the ninth round .
Grant was ahead on all three judges ' cards when the bout was stopped .
He had knocked down Sullivan with a blistering left-right-left combination to the chin at 1 : 50 of the round , a right hand whistling past Sullivan 's head as he was falling back to the canvas .
Grant was so happy with the victory that he raced across the ring , jumped into the air as if he were going to hurdle the top rope and then fell flat on his back .
`` I was thinking about jumping over the top rope , '' Grant said .
`` I just pulled myself back before I hurt myself .
I didn n't want to land on some spectators and take them out . ''
Grant 's record improved to 27 - 0 with 20 knockouts and he seems to be on a collision course for a title shot against Lewis or Holyfield .
Lewis has always bemoaned the fact that he has never been able to test himself against the best of his contemporaries , such as Holyfield , Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe .
He might as well look to the future .
`` There 's no rush for me , '' Grant said of getting a title shot soon .
`` Staying in the gym is the key for me now .
I hope and pray that I stay humble and hungry and accept all the advice that I 'm getting from people like Don Turner . ''
Tommy Brooks , Grant 's co-trainer , calls him `` a work in progress . ''
Turner , Grant 's head trainer , has hired Robert Lee , who once trained Hector Camacho , to work with Grant on the sport 's nuances .
Grant tried to deploy one of the new techniques against Sullivan , who sought to fight inside most of the night .
He had mixed success with the maneuver , throwing a hook off the spin move .
`` When I was thinking about the move , Obed was hitting me with shots , '' Grant said .
`` I just have to keep doing it , so that it comes naturally . ''
Turner believes that Grant is already in the same class as the top-flight heavyweights , but thinks he needs one or two more fights before he is ready for a title shot .
The candidates mentioned are Larry Donald , Kirk Johnson and Michael Moorer .
Turner said that Grant , who had 12 fights as an amateur ( 11 - 1 ) , had less experience than any of the other young heavyweights _ David Tua and Chris Byrd _ on Saturday night 's card and even if he were to win the championship after his next two or three fights , he would still need more seasoning .
Byrd ( 25 - 0 ) , who admitted that he was lackluster in his 10-round unanimous decision over Eliecer Castillo ( 14 - 1 ) , was booed by the crowd .
Although he is a skilled boxer , Byrd lacks pizzaz and it might hurt his television appeal .
`` Even though Castillo wasn n't a great opponent , he was right there in front of him , '' Lou DiBella , the vice president of programming for HBO Sports , said of Byrd .
Tua ( 31 - 1 ) was impressive in knocking out a flabby Nate Tubbs ( 17 - 4 ) at 2 : 12 of the second round .
There was no mention from DiBella or Dino Duva , the president of Main Events and the promoter of the card , regarding Tua or Byrd fighting Grant .
Asked if he would like to fight Grant , Byrd said : `` I 'd have to think a lot in a fight against Mike , because if I didn n't he 'd run over me . ''
