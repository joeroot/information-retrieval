SHOULD YOU EXERCISE WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD ?
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By USHA LEE MCFARLING c.1998 The Boston Globe
Q. We 've debated this question in the locker room for several years .
Should you stop working out or work out at a reduced level when you have a cold ?
Does exercise sap energy needed to fight off a cold ?

A. A sports physiologist and a personal trainer we consulted on this question say there is no definitive answer to your question but there simple guidelines to follow when sniffles catch up with you .
First , decide if the symptoms are more cold-like or flu-like , says Ken Baldwin , a personal trainer and president of Premier Fitness Inc. in Cambridge , Mass. If it 's simply a cold that 's cut your energy levels and given you a runny nose , you might want to work out , but at reduced levels .
While doing so , make sure your heart rate and temperature aren n't rising excessively .
Also , stop exercising if you feel dizzy .
If symptoms are flu-like , says Baldwin , and you have chest congestion or fever , you might want to stay off the treadmill .
`` We usually advise people to go home , rest , and drink a lot of fluids , '' says Baldwin , an official of IDEA , an international association that educates those in the exercise industry .
`` If you 're wheezing and coughing up phlegm , you just can n't exercise . ''
If you 're new to exercising _ less than three weeks _ it 's better to err on the side of caution and sit out exercising while sick , advises Greg Bennett , a senior exercise physiologist at the Health and Lifestyle Center of Memorial Hospital in South Bend , Ind.
Exercisers who have been sick face a second decision as well : when to return to a normal regimen .
Don n't try to catch up , or overdo your exercising to make up for the days missed , cautions Bennett .
`` You may be symptom-free , but your body is still recovering , '' he says .
`` It needs time to rebound . ''
Build up slowly .
You won n't lose those strength or cardiovascular gains in just a few days , he adds .
Baldwin and Bennett say that exercising too soon after you 've been sick , or overdoing exercise , can sap the immune system .
`` Rather than having the resources to fight the flu , you 're trying to recover from a worn-out cardiovascular system , '' says Baldwin .
