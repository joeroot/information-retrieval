WASHINGTON _ Now that India has shown the world that it could quietly purify enough plutonium for the five nuclear devices it detonated recently _ and probably enough for many more _ attention is turning to how to divorce nuclear weapons from nuclear power plants .
A small company based here says it has the answer , by substituting thorium for some of the uranium in fuel for power reactors .
The company , Radkowsky Thorium Power Corp. , headed by a physicist who was formerly the chief scientist of the U.S. Naval Propulsion Program , says its fuel could be used in existing reactors in place of the ordinary uranium fuel , and would produce very little plutonium , a normal byproduct of the reaction when uranium is used .
The company plans to test its fuel in 2002 in a Russian reactor that resembles the dominant U.S. design .
Proponents say it could also be offered to countries like North Korea and Cuba , which say they want reactors to generate electric power .
But some fear they want reactors mostly to generate plutonium for weapons .
The thorium reactor could also be useful for burning up surplus weapons plutonium _ the United States has at least 50 tons of it _ without producing nearly as much new plutonium as existing reactors do .
And the plutonium it does produce would be a mix of types that makes the weapon prone to `` fizzle , '' or sustain a chain reaction for only a brief period , cutting its explosive yield by 95 to 97 percent .
`` It 's pretty intriguing , '' said Christopher Payne , a senior researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group that is active in nuclear proliferation issues .
`` It 's worth looking into . ''
`` It 's a lot better than what we 've got , '' said Robert H. Williams , a physicist at the Princeton University Center for Energy and Environmental Studies .
He pointed out , though , that even if production is cut by 80 percent , a large nuclear reactor would still produce enough plutonium each year for several bombs .
The Energy Department has contributed $ 1.1 million to help with the development and Raytheon Engineers & AMP ; Constructors , which hopes to win engineering work if the system is used , paid $ 500 , 000 .
Alvin Radkowsky , who was the chief scientist of the Naval Propulsion Program from 1948 to 1972 , designed the fuel .
But some people question whether Radkowsky 's fuel can compete with existing ones , because the operating characteristics of the existing fuels are so well known .
Developers refer to Radkowsky 's system as a reactor , but it is essentially a new core , replacing the fuel in an existing reactor .
Its benefit is to change a characteristic of nuclear reactors that was long considered a virtue but is now a problem : that as they consume the kind of uranium that can be readily split , they make a new kind of atom that can also be split easily , plutonium .
The fuel for nearly all reactors today is uranium-235 , which is called `` fissile , '' because it can be fissioned , or split .
It is mixed with uranium-238 , which is very hard to split .
When the uranium-235 is split , it gives off neutrons that go on to fission other atoms , sustaining a chain reaction .
But often a neutron hits an atom of uranium-238 , a material that is called `` fertile , '' because instead of being split by the neutron , it absorbs the neutron and changes into a new material , in this case , plutonium-239 .
Plutonium is a different element , and thus is fairly easy to chemically separate from the rest of the fuel when the fuel bundle is removed from the reactor .
The Radkowsky fuel avoids plutonium production by minimizing the use of fertile uranium .
Instead it uses thorium , a material that was tried with uranium in the first civilian reactors in the 1950s and '60s but later dropped in favor of straight uranium fuel .
Thorium , cheap and plentiful , can not be fissioned to produce energy , but it is also fertile , and as it absorbs stray neutrons it is converted to something fissile , in this case , uranium-233 .
But uranium-233 is hard to separate from other uranium in the core , and thus is hard to purify for bombs .

Thomas Graham , a former negotiator for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency who is now president of the Lawyers ' Alliance for World Security and a member of the Radkowsky company 's board of directors , said that what India had done in the last few years would have been nearly impossible if that country 's reactors had used Radkowsky fuel .
Pakistan could still have developed its bombs , however , because its weapons used enriched uranium , not plutonium .
That route to a bomb is much more expensive and difficult , though , he said .
A reactor that does not produce much plutonium would be useful in the United States as well .
To dispose of excess plutonium , the Energy Department wants to use it to fuel conventional civilian reactors , but for each 3 pounds of pure plutonium that is converted into fuel , another 2 pounds of plutonium will be created in those reactors , and that theoretically could be refined and turned into new weapons fuel .
( Some designs are called breeder reactors , because each atom split produces more than one additional fissile atom . )
In the Radkowksy fuel , far less plutonium is created .
And of the uranium-233 that is created , most is consumed in the fuel as it is made , producing heat that can be turned into electricity .
If the reactor is shut down before the fuel is fully consumed , the uranium mix inside would be extremely difficult to purify and refine into bomb fuel , physicists say .
This is because some of it has absorbed yet another neutron and turned into uranium-234 , and the thorium also has some uranium-238 added .
Separating those forms of uranium from each other would be difficult , because they are chemically identical .
The design is similar to existing nuclear fuel : ceramic pellets about the size of pencil erasers loaded into long , thin metal tubes , sometimes as long as 14 feet , assembled into bundles .
Radkowsky 's design is that each bundle would have an inner `` seed '' using uranium , and outer tubes forming a `` blanket , '' filled mostly with thorium .
The seed could also be made of plutonium .
The thorium system has drawbacks , though .
One is that the uranium in the seed would have to be enriched to about 20 percent of the fissile type of uranium , uranium-235 , compared with about 3 - 5 percent in conventional reactors .
Up to 20 percent is still considered low enrichment , far too low for a bomb , but far above the natural level of 0.7 percent .
And a nation or group that wanted an atom bomb would have a major head start in building a uranium model if it began with fuel enriched to 20 percent .
Another problem is that while total plutonium production is low , it is concentrated in the fuel rods in the seed , not those in the blanket .
In fact , there would be more plutonium in a ton of used seed from the Radkowsky design than from a ton of used uranium fuel from a conventional uranium reactor .
But Alex Galperin , a professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and an associate of Radkowsky , said in a telephone interview that the mix of types of plutonium in the reactor would still deter someone who wanted to build a bomb .
For one thing , it would have a large quantity of plutonium-238 , which gives off heat for years , so much heat , he said , that it would interfere with the high explosives that are used to help set off a nuclear weapon .
It would also contain a large amount of plutonium-240 and plutonium-242 , which tend to emit neutrons spontaneously .
These neutrons can start a chain reaction too soon , leading to a fizzle .
The company says such plutonium would never produce more than a fizzle .
Harold A. Fieveson , of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Princeton University and the editor of Science and Global Security , said this was `` really lousy plutonium from a weapons point of view . ''
`` It would be possible with a lot of care and tremendous difficulty to fabricate a weapon that could have a yield of hundreds of tons , but it would be a bigger weapon than you would need with normal plutonium , '' he said , making it harder to deliver .
But Arjun Makhijani , the president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research , said that a device that produced only a fizzle could still be a weapon .
Makhijani , a physicist , said `` a 50 percent probability that it will fizzle is not good enough , if you 're trying to protect yourself against it . ''
And , he said , a fizzle was a mere 3 to 5 percent of the potential explosive value , but that is still 3 to 5 percent of a very large number .
If a Nagasaki-sized weapon fizzled , he said , that would still be 100 times larger than the bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , or the Marine barracks in Beiruit .
But it would still be 20 or 30 times smaller than a typical nuclear weapon .
