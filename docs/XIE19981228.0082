Nigeria Records deficit in 1998 , Says Abubakar
LAGOS , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar has said that his government would record a deficit of some 2.33 billion U.S. Dollars in 1998 and definitely was going to run a deficit budget for 1999 .
The head of state said on Christmas Day in capital Abuja that if the current pattern continued into the new year , the government might record a higher deficit of about 4.65 billion Dollars in 1999 , This Day newspaper reported Monday .
He noted that the falling prices for crude oil , which started soon after the Nigerian government announced the 1998 budget , had messed up the government 's revenue calculations for 1998 .
In January , he said , Nigeria realized more than 700 million Dollars from crude oil sales and 350 million Dollars from royalties .
But in October this year , he added , due to the drop in the crude oil prices and the unrest in the Delta Region ( oil producing area ) , Nigeria realized only 285 million Dollars from oil sales and 83 million Dollars from royalties .
Abubakar stated that the Nigerian government might have realized only about 6.99 billion Dollars in the first 10 months of 1998 from the oil revenue .
Energy experts estimate that if the prices for crude oil continue falling , the government would only be able to net in about 7.45 billion Dollars in 1998 , as against 10.89 billion Dollars and 11.99 billion Dollars in 1996 and 1997 respectively .
" Winter is almost over now and that is when we expect the price of crude oil to go up , but the reverse is the case , " said Abubakar .
He noted that there is a message from the multi-national oil firms to their companies all over the world to use nine Dollars per barrel as their budget line .
Industry observers said if the present scenario continues unabated , the Nigerian government may have a very big crisis in the coming year as more than 70 percent of the country 's revenue comes from oil sales .
The falling oil price has threatened the government 's revenue while the government will have to spend heavily to finance the transitional program , they said .
" Definitely there is no way we would have a balance budget in 1999 .
Definitely we are going to run a deficit budget , " stressed the head of state .
On how to resolve the dilemma , he said " we are looking into the area of capital development , to cut down unnecessary overhead , to minimize all the non-essentials , to cut down on the number of conferences , trim the number of offices , cut down on the number of vehicles and all that . "
