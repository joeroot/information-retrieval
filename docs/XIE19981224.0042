Former Tehran Mayor 's Lawyer Rejects Court Ruling
TEHRAN , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Bahman Keshavarz , lawyer of former Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi on Thursday rejected the verdict of an Iranian appeals courts which reduced Karbaschi 's prison sentence from five years to two years .
" We will protest the segments of the verdict of the court of appeals which upheld the conviction , " Keshavarz was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency ( IRNA ) as saying .
He said that he would not accept the ruling issued by the court and would lodge a protest in accordance with the law on formation of public courts .
The Iranian judiciary issued a statement on Thursday that an appeals court has reduced the prison sentence of Karbaschi from five years to two years and reduced the period Karbaschi was banned from taking public office from 20 years to 10 years .
The court also changed his lashing sentence to a cash fine of 10 million rials ( about 1,600 U.S. dollars ) .
Karbaschi , publicly tried on charges of graft in July , had received five years in prison , a 20-year ban from holding government posts , 60 lashes of the whip and a fine of one billion rials ( about 1.6 million dollars ) .
The judicial statement said that Karbaschi 's fine of one billion rials remained intact and he was also ordered to return 600 million rials ( about 100,000 dollars ) to the public coffers .
The mayor , a well-known reformist and a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami , had been a target of hard-line political rivals who control the country 's judiciary .
Karbaschi was temporally jailed in April , but was released under an order from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei after political disturbance occurred in the country following his arrest .
