On Saturday night , the U.N. Security Council reviewed Aziz 's letter .
Among the 15 members of Security Council , the United States was the only one that called Iraq 's offer unacceptable .
Washington said Iraq set conditions for its resumption of cooperation in an annex to the letter and that its threat of military strikes against Baghdad remained in place .
In the annex , Iraq stated its views on the proposed comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N relevant resolutions by the Security Council and the restructure of the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) in charge of dismantling Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
Russia said Iraq , both in Baghdad and in New York , had mad it clear that the annex was not listing conditions but stating Baghdad 's view .
China and France shared the same view with Russia .
Britain said it was skeptical about Iraq 's decision .
In a related development , Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov , attending the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , warned that any unilateral actions against Iraq would aggravate the situation .
