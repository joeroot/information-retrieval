ATLANTA _ For many people , the most frustrating part of vehicle ownership is getting quality service at a fair price .
Because most of us are not certified automotive technicians , when we talk to our technician about vehicle repairs , it 's not unlike trying to feel knowledgeable about dealing in rocket science .
Normally , I feel confident about automotive topics , but a recent experience proved that under some circumstances , I can be just as lost at the repair shop as the next guy .
I own a 1978 crew-cab dual rear wheel pickup truck .
Obviously , it is not new , but it is in excellent shape .
With tender loving care , I don n't see why I can n't expect to drive it another 217,000 miles .
A few months back , it started to develop a front-end shimmy .
When it started to eat up front tires , I decided it was time to do something about it .
Usually all work is done on my truck by one technician .
He worked at the dealership when I bought the vehicle two decades ago .
I was so impressed with the quality of his work that when he changed locations , I followed him .
Eventually , he opened a small shop , and I have been a loyal customer for years .
Because he is a one-man operation and mine is such a big truck , I decided to take it to the dealer for the front-end repairs .
Having known the dealership 's service writer for years , I told him to do whatever was necessary .
I also mentioned that I needed the truck back quickly .
Two days later , I got a phone call saying the truck needed to have its whole front end rebuilt .
The estimate was $ 1,200 to $ 1 , 500 .
My husband threw up a stop sign , thank goodness .
To the dealership 's credit , the service writer did call me .
I had made a big mistake when I told them to fix whatever was wrong .
I went back to my old mechanic .
After inspecting the truck , he said the sway bar bushings were worn and it appeared to be out of alignment .
I asked him to fix the bushings , pack the front wheel bearings and check the shocks just to be on the safe side .
My total bill , including four new premium-brand gas shocks , was $ 261 .
He apologized that he couldn n't do the alignment , but located a shop that could and sent me on my way .
At the alignment shop , I explained my situation and told them also if they found anything wrong to let me know .
I picked the truck up four hours later with a bill for $ 72 .
All it needed was an alignment .
The dealership 's service writer was fair to me , but someone in the shop either didn n't want the job on such a big truck or didn n't know what to do about it .
Bottom line : If you go in for service _ to a dealer , an independent shop or a franchise repair shop _ and they throw out a number you find objectionable , don n't hesitate to get a second opinion .
After all , if you went to the doctor with a corn and he wanted to cut your leg off , you 'd go elsewhere .
