TECHNOLOGY STOCKS TAKE A POUNDING
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By JOANN MULLER c.1998 The Boston Globe
Technology stocks , the engine behind the stock market 's incredible run-up during the 1990s , collapsed Monday amid a huge selloff by skittish investors worried about the world economy .
The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index fell more than all other major stock indexes , tumbling a record 140.43 points or 8.6 percent , to 1499.25 .
By comparison , the Dow Jones Industrial Average _ an index of 30 large industrial companies _ tumbled 512.61 points Monday , or 6.37 percent , to 7539.07 .
Fast-growing technology companies have always been ripe for speculation among investors , making them more volatile than most shares .
But even the `` safe '' technology stocks _ companies that are leaders in their market segments _ were hammered Monday , analysts noted .
That shows how concerned investors have become that worldwide economic woes , particularly in Asia , will lead to a possible slowdown in sales of computers and related equipment and products .
`` It 's fairly indiscriminate .
Everybody got hit , '' said Ullas Naik , a Boston-based Internet and electronic commerce analyst for First Albany Corp.
Shares in Dell Computer Corp. , the super-efficient direct seller of personal computers , plunged 18 3 / 4 to 100 , wiping out $ 13 billion of the company 's market value .
It was the most active stock in U.S. markets , with 48.6 million shares trading hands .
Cisco Systems Inc. , the No. 1 computer-networking company , fell 12 13 / 16 to 81 7 / 8 , erasing $ 14 billion of market value .
Intel Corp. , the No. 1 computer-chip maker , tumbled 5 13 / 16 to 71 3 / 16 .
Microsoft Corp. , the world 's largest software company , fell 9 5 / 16 to 95 15 / 16 , its lowest level since June .
International Business Machines Corp. , the No. 1 computer company , tumbled 9 15 / 16 to 112 5 / 8.
EMC Corp. , the leading provider of computer storage equipment and software , tumbled 13.6 percent .
Its shares plunged 7 to 44 1 / 2 Monday .
Since peaking at 59 7 / 16 on Aug. 19 , EMC shares have skidded 22 percent .
Companies such as these are vulnerable in a slumping stock market because their shares had & UR ; & LR ; become so expensive in recent months .
In many cases , their price-to-earnings ratios had been driven to unrealistic highs and now investors are worried about paying too much .
That 's what happened earlier this summer when Internet stocks went through the roof , and then came tumbling down after investors realized the prices were too high .
Monday , Internet stocks tumbled even further .
Internet search company Lycos Inc. of Framingham , Mass. was among the hardest hit Massachusetts companies .
Its shares plunged 38 percent , or 8 3 / 16 , to 21 11 / 16 .
In July , it was trading at nearly $ 50 a share .
CMG Information Services Inc. of Andover , Mass. , which owns a chunk of Lycos and a range of other Internet-related companies , was also hammered .
Its stock fell 24 percent , or 11 7 / 8 , to close at 38 1 / 8.
Less than a month ago , it was trading at more than 87 .
Other big losers locally were : Polaroid Corp. and Avid Technology Inc. , both of which fell about 18 percent ; GeoTel Communications Inc. , which plunged 15 percent , and Keane Inc. , which fell more than 12 percent .
But technology analysts such as William Becklean & UR ; & LR ; , managing director of Tucker Anthony Inc. in Boston , said the big selloff in technology stocks doesn n't reflect individual concerns about those companies .
Rather , it 's a result of investors seeking to get out of the stock market quickly and shift their money to safer havens .
But Naik , of First Albany , said many investors are doing their homework to identify the best-positioned companies , so that when the market finally hits bottom , they 'll be in a position to buy again .
Companies that make computers and the equipment to link them were buoyed in the past four months as the rest of the market fell .
Until today , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest non-financial companies was up 28 percent for the year .
Now , it 's up 15 percent .
Part of the selling may be coming from mutual fund managers who need to sell stocks to pay investors who are redeeming fund shares , or hedge fund managers who face big losses in other investments .
Many managers already have cut their holdings in other industries , and may now be turning to computer-related stocks , because many have relatively large holdings in the industry .
The largest technology stocks are also easy to trade , enabling investors to dump them quickly if they want cash .
