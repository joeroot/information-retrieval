Some 800 Thai Officials Involved in Drug Trade : Press
BANGKOK , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- More than 800 government officials in Thailand have been involved in narcotics trading , the English newspaper Bangkok Post said here Thursday .
The newspaper quoted Minister of Prime Minister 's Office Jurin Laksanavisit as saying that the officials include state enterprise employees , kamnans ( district administrators ) and village chiefs who have been under watch .
The minister declined to give further details of the officials on the blacklist , the Bangkok Post said .
A ministerial regulation to forbid civil servants from getting involved in the drugs trade has been issued after information compiled by concerned agencies detailed the extent of government officials ' involvement in the illicit business , Jurin was quoted as saying Wednesday .
The ministerial regulation aims to make civil servants aware of their honor and prestige as well as the punishment if caught being involved in narcotics activities , he said .
The minister said the Office of the Narcotics Control Board ( ONCB ) has opened a post box to enable the public to provide information on suspected involvement in narcotics by state officials .
Jurin , who oversees the ONCB , said the opening of the post box is supplementary to the ministerial regulation approved by the cabinet two weeks ago .
