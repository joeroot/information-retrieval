Typhoons Leave 27 Dead in Philippines
MANILA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- At least 27 people were killed in the northern Philippines due to floods brought about by two successive typhoons that hit the country over the weekend , the National Disaster Coordinating Council ( NDCC ) said Monday .
Floodwaters also forced the government to evacuate 13,446 families or 70,512 people in the northern island of Luzon , including those in Metro Manila , when typhoon Emang and tropical storm Gading blasted the country , the NDCC said in a report .
The death toll of 27 did not include the 42 fatalities in the sinking of a passenger ship last Friday night at the mouth of Manila Bay .
Navy and Coast Guard ships are still combing the mouth of Manila Bay for possible survivors , although hopes are fading fast for any of the missing to survive after three days at sea without food and drinking water .
Frogmen Monday retrieved three more bodies swept to the shorelines of Cavite , bringing to 54 the death toll in the sea tragedy .
A total of 357 survivors have been rescued and 43 people are still missing .
In the northern province of Pangasinan , floods continued to rise after excess water from Biga Dam was released on a calibrated basis .
Several towns are in danger of being isolated by the rampaging floodwaters in the province , the hardest-stricken by the two typhoons , NDCC said .
Several roads and bridges in northern Luzon were also flooded at the height of the rain .
Some areas in Metro Manila were not spared .
President Joseph Estrada has declared a state of calamity in Pangasinan and its neighboring province Pampanga .
A total of 9.5 million pesos ( 220,930 U.S. dollars ) were allocated by Estrada for disaster-relief and rehabilitation efforts in Pampanga .
