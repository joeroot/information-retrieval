Americans will be traveling more this summer , and _ in spite of lower gasoline prices _ spending more in the process , according to the Travel Industry Association of America and AAA .
& QL ;
United States travelers will take a total of 251 million `` person trips '' ( a family of four taking a trip together counts as four person-trips ) .
& QL ;
That number is an increase of 3 percent , on top of a 9 percent jump in 1997 , according to a survey undertaken by the Travel Industry Association of America .
That family of four will spend $ 218 a day on meals and lodging , $ 19 more than it spent last year , according to a survey of vacation costs by AAA .
& QL ;
Florida , California and Hawaii continue to top the list of places Americans most want to visit .
& QL ;
Just over half of the 1,500 travelers surveyed , 51 percent , will be taking children _ either their own or grandchildren _ up from 43 percent last year .
& QL ;
For the first time travelers were asked if they expected to attend a family reunion this year , and 25 percent said yes ; the proportion was the same among travelers with children and those without .

Yes , you may have to duck a flying cow at the latest attraction at Universal Studios Florida .
In Twister ...
Ride It Out , based on the movie `` Twister , '' the cow is from a sign , however , not a farm .
& QL ;
The attraction opened May 4 after a one-month delay out of respect for the 42 people who died in tornadoes in February in central Florida , not far from this Orlando theme park .
( Universal says it donated $ 100,000 in aid for the victims . ) & QL ;
The Twister experience , using a video with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt , the stars of `` Twister , '' guides guests into a sound studio displaying the movie 's scene of the wreckage of Aunt Meg 's home .
The sky darkens , the temperature drops and winds howl .
The guests , warned of an impending tornado , are evacuated to the drive-in theater and Quonset hut seen in the movie .
& QL ;
There they see , hear and feel the power of a five-story twister , including winds ( kept to 35 miles an hour ) created by dozens of powerful fans ; the ubiquitous `` freight train '' roar ( through 54 speakers ) , and pelting rain created by 150,000 gallons of recycled water daily ( guests ( italics ) will ( end italics ) get wet ) .
For about five minutes , the building shakes , sparks from downed electric wires fly , and the landscape is ripped apart .
& QL ;
Universal Studios Florida offers a number of options for admission to the 444-acre park , including a single-day pass for $ 44.52 , $ 36.04 ages 3 to 9 ; a two-day pass , $ 65.72 and $ 55.12 ; and a ticket to two or three other theme parks , including Sea World , Wet ' n Wild , and Busch Gardens in Tampa , costing $ 82.95 to $ 129.95 .
The park opens at 9 a.m. daily ; closing time varies from 7 to 10 p.m. Information : ( 407 ) 363 - 8000 .

Mount Rushmore National Memorial _ the 60-foot-high sculpture in the Black Hills of South Dakota of George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt _ will hold a grand opening for its new visitor center and museum on June 15 , marking the end of a decade of construction work .
Additions include a grand entry and visitor plaza , a restaurant , a gift shop , an amphitheater , a walking trail and a viewing platform .
& QL ;
The new interactive museum offers exhibits on the sculptor , Gutzon Borglum , and the 392 original workers on the project , which began in 1927 and was dedicated in 1941 .
The four presidents and the history of the United States are also part of the focus .
A 13-minute orientation film will be shown in two new 125-seat theaters .
& QL ;
Grandview Terrace , the new viewing platform , offers an unobstructed look at the faces ( with their 20-foot noses ) , and allows visitors to get closer to the sculpture than ever before .
& QL ;
Most of the $ 60 million project was paid for with private money .
The Mount Rushmore National Memorial Society raised $ 23 million ; the federal government provided $ 3 million , and the rest came from the companies that operate the concessions .
& QL ;
Mount Rushmore National Memorial is in Keystone , about half an hour from Rapid City .

Two more historic houses are opening their doors to visitors in Newport , R.I . , this summer .
Both are recent acquisitions of the Preservation Society of Newport County .
& QL ;
Chepstow , a three-story Italianate villa designed by the Newport architect George Champlin Mason , is scheduled to open on Friday .
It will be available for tours , by appointment only , on Fridays and Saturdays through October .
Built in 1860 as a summer residence for Edmund Schermerhorn _ a first cousin of one of the town 's most active hostesses , Mrs. William Astor Jr. _ Chepstow was bought in 1911 by Mrs. Emily Morris Gallatin , of the Morris family , prominent members of New York 's Old Guard .
The property , named for the own in Wales that the family came from , overlooks Narragansett Avenue , where generations of summer visitors have strolled .
& QL ;
Although far less grand than some of Newport 's mansions , Chepstow houses an outstanding collection of art and furniture , including some from other Morris family residences .
Among the many American paintings bequeathed to the society and hanging here are works by George Harvey , Fitz Hugh Lane and Granville Perkins .
Among the furnishings is a walnut Queen Anne side chair said to have belonged to William Penn .
& QL ;
In late summer _ probably in early August _ the Isaac Bell House on Bellevue Avenue will also open to visitors on Fridays and Saturdays _ as a work in progress .
The mansion , named for its original owner , a prosperous New York cotton broker and a key investor in the trans-Atlantic cable , is undergoing an extensive restoration .
Built from 1881 to 1883 by the New York architectural firm of McKim , Mead & AMP ; White , the house is said to have been a great influence on Frank Lloyd Wright .
It is one of the country 's finest examples of the shingle style .
Although the exterior restoration was completed early this year , research for the interior is still going on .
In addition to viewing the elaborately detailed exterior of uniquely patterned cedar shingles , towers , chimneys , porches and columns , visitors can expect to see firsthand how such a complicated restoration develops .
There will be no furniture or collections in the rooms until the project 's completion , which is expected to take several years .
& QL ;
The tours cost $ 8 each , $ 5 for students and children .
For information , call the Preservation Society of Newport County at ( 401 ) 847 - 1000 ; its Web site is www.newportmansions.org .
