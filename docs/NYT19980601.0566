SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT URGES CLOSER TIES WITH NORTH

SEOUL , South Korea _ In an effort to ease half a century of enmities on the Korean Peninsula , President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea called on Monday for the United States and other Western countries to end sanctions against North Korea and to show greater flexibility in dealing with it .
Kim said that when he makes a state visit to Washington next week , which will include an address to a joint session of Congress , he will urge the United States to give up its economic sanctions against North Korea .
He will suggest , instead , a policy of increasing political `` engagement '' and growing economic ties as the best way to moderate the behavior of North Korea , the world 's last Stalinist state .
While Western policies are not expected to change overnight , the pressures for a policy of greater engagement with the North have already been building , and Kim 's arguments are sure to carry enormous weight in Washington and Tokyo .
In an hourlong interview Monday in Blue House , the presidential mansion , Kim emphasized that he had no illusions about the North , which even in recent years has sent armed infiltrators into South Korea and continues to aim a vast array of artillery at Seoul .
But he also suggested that it is time to try a new approach to reduce the tensions and the risk of war .
`` It would be desirable for the United States to ease its economic sanctions on North Korea , '' Kim said .
`` I think this would be more effective in efforts to get North Korea to open up and liberalize . ''
Under the Trading With the Enemy Act , U.S. companies are basically banned from doing any business in or with North Korea .
Some exceptions have been made , but the sanctions remain so broad that they have even prevented American basketball teams from signing up a 7-foot-9-inch North Korean basketball player , who would be the tallest player on record .
Kim , who took office in February , has made conciliatory statements about North Korea in the past , including suggestions for economic and cultural contacts between the two Koreas and proposals for an inter-Korean summit meeting .
But Monday 's comments were his strongest call for change in the West 's approach to North Korea .
Indeed , as recently as Friday , he had given a Korean newspaper the standard response about U.S. sanctions _ that whether they should be lifted must depend on `` progress in inter-Korean relations . ''
Pressed on the point Monday , Kim made clear that he preferred that the United States lift sanctions , not just amend them , and that it do so without setting conditions .
Moreover , he urged that this be done as part of a broad transformation of Western policy toward North Korea .
`` I would like to see improvement in relations between Japan and North Korea and in fact between the rest of the Western world and North Korea , '' Kim said .
`` I believe these improved relations will lead to changes in North Korea and to North Korea opening up . ''
Kim 's nine-day visit to the United States beginning on Saturday will not focus only on relations with North Korea but also on a broad array of economic , cultural and political issues , such as efforts to reassure U.S. investors about South Korea 's business prospects .
The trip will also be a nostalgic homecoming for a one-time dissident who was twice exiled in the United States , who learned English from an American Peace Corps volunteer and who credits U.S. pressure with saving his life when Korean dictators sought to kill him .
Yet few problems of international relations have been so intractable over the last half-century as the continuing cold war on the Korean Peninsula _ President Clinton has called the jagged `` demilitarized zone '' between the two Koreas `` the scariest place on earth '' _ and Kim said that one key purpose of his visit to the United States is `` to win a more flexible stance in our two countries ' dealings with North Korea . ''
In effect , Kim made the same argument about North Korea on Monday that the Clinton administration has made about China _ that the best way to tame it is not to isolate it and punish it with sanctions but rather to build economic and diplomatic ties that draw it out onto the international playing field .
In the past , the United States has made some half-hearted efforts toward engagement , and it has lifted some sanctions .
But each time one crucial brake on the process has been vociferous warnings from Seoul that Washington must not get too friendly with its enemy in the North .
Kim from the start has staked out a policy very different from that of his predecessors .
The previous president , Kim Young Sam , nursed a resentment of the North that dated at least from the murder of his mother by suspected North Korean infiltrators in 1960 .
Kim Dae-jung was himself arrested and targeted for execution by North Korean officials , in the 1950s .
But in contrast to past presidents he has emphasized that South Korea 's fundamental approach should not be to squeeze North Korea into submission but rather to build trust and economic links .
`` In the past , economic cooperation was greatly restricted , '' Kim said .
`` We wish to lift all the restrictions so that cooperation can take place in a free atmosphere . ''
`` I expect to see a great activation of economic cooperation , '' he added .
`` This benefits not only the North Korean economy but our economy as well . ''
So far the North Korean leader , Kim Jong Il , has not responded to Kim 's conciliatory remarks in recent months , or to his suggestions for an inter-Korean summit .
Kim Dae Jung admitted Monday that he was a bit `` disappointed '' by the lack of response from North Korea .
Asked whether he still thought a summit meeting might be held this year , he grinned and said , `` Only a fortuneteller can answer that . ''

nn
Still , he quickly added , `` It is at least possible to be more hopeful than in the past . ''
Kim 's call for an end to sanctions appeared to be a deliberate effort to advance the discussion about North Korea policy in the West , for he repeated it and elaborated on it several times .
But he also made clear that he did not expect any immediate results .
`` As we stick to this tolerance on our part , with such a flexible approach , then perhaps not in the near term but in the long run we 'll be able to see changes in North Korea 's attitude , '' Kim said .
To be sure , any progress in relations between the West and North Korea is likely to be gradual .
Many U.S. officials perceive North Korea as a dinosaur _ and a malevolent one at that .
And companies are not exactly jostling one another for the right to invest in one of the world 's last communist countries , particularly one that refuses entry to most Americans .
Still , the U.S. government has been torn in recent years about what to do with North Korea .
Particularly since 1994 , when the United States and North Korea agreed to improve ties as part of a pact to end the North 's suspected nuclear weapons program , some U.S. officials _ most notably James Laney , a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea _ have argued for a policy of greater engagement with the North .
While keeping some sanctions , the United States has contributed emergency food aid to the North and has expressed its readiness to exchange liaison offices whenever the North wants .
Kim 's ideas carry special force because he is not only his country 's president but an emerging leader for Asia as a whole , a longtime campaigner for democracy who for decades has written widely about international issues .
Korean officials and Western diplomats said that they did not expect Kim 's visit to the United States to result in any landmark new agreements , but rather to affirm an already strong relationship and to give Kim a chance to try to rebuild international confidence in the tattered Korean economy .
`` It 's an opportunity for him and for us to publicly show support for his efforts to bring Korea out of this morass , to solidify the security relationship and to commend Kim Dae Jung for embracing democracy and making the tough choices to repair the economy , '' said Stephen Bosworth , the U.S. ambassador to Seoul .
In Washington , a Clinton administration official , insisting on anonymity , said Monday evening that Kim 's remarks were not a surprise , because he had hinted at a softening in his stance in recent remarks to South Korean journalists .
Clinton 's reaction , delivered by his spokesman , Mike McCurry , was low-key and cautious .
`` We look forward to President Kim 's first visit since his election , '' McCurry said Monday , adding that it would provide `` an opportunity to continue our close consultations and exchange of views on how best to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula . ''
