WHO to Strengthen Cooperation with China
BEIJING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The World Health Organization ( WHO ) plans to provide China with technology and personnels needed to tackle problems related to the medicare system reform , a virtual epidemic of tuberculosis and AIDS , according to WHO director-general Gro Brundtland .
WHO is willing to provide support and strengthen cooperation with China in related areas , according to Brundtland .
The WHO official made the comments during an afternoon meeting with Health Minister Zhang Wenkang .
China is reforming its decades-old free medicare system in urban and rural areas because it no longer satisfies the increasing demand for medical services and results in an excessive waste of health resources , said Zhang .
The goal of reform is to provide basic medical services and attract both governmental and individual funding , as well as the valuable advice and successful experience offered by WHO , according to Zhang .
Zhang responded to the WHO official 's question concerning an epidemic of tuberculosis ( TB ) and HIV / AIDS in China by noting that the Chinese government pays great attention on preventing and controlling the diseases .
The government is especially concerned about the fact that 40 percent of areas lacking effective treatments for TB report over 250,000 related deaths every year .
AIDS , which has preyed on a reported 300,000 people in China , has also been the subject of close government attention , with plans calling for publication of national plans for AIDS control in the near future , said Zhang .
Brundtland , who is visiting China for the first time as the head of WHO , said the organization will launch a Stop TB Initiative designed to spark global concern about the disease .
She expressed the hope the Chinese government will support the activity .
The Chinese health minister also expressed his wish to help both neighboring and African countries establish training centers and develop drugs to control malaria .
WHO officials will also visit central China 's Hubei Province and the eastern city of Shanghai to investigate local work to control TB , as well as rural health care services and medicare for the elderly .
