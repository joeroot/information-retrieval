HEART-OBESITY-MED _ NEW YORK _ Obesity has graduated from a contributing risk factor for heart disease to a major one , experts from the American Heart Association are scheduled to announce here Monday .
But congratulations are not in order , as the promotion now places obesity in the same class with other preventable heart-disease risk factors such as smoking , high cholesterol , high blood pressure and sedentary lifestyle , according to Dr. Robert H. Eckel , vice-chairman of the American Heart Association 's ( AHA ) volunteer nutrition committee and a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver .
Formerly , obesity was considered a contributing factor to heart disease , but recent evidence has shown that it is , in fact , a major risk factor , Eckel said at an AHA-sponsored media briefing .
But modest weight loss of 5 percent to 10 percent of body weight can reduce blood pressure levels and high cholesterol , he said .
Eckel called for more research into the causes of obesity and suggested a need `` to develop better treatment and lifestyle strategies to address the issue of obesity without passing moral judgment . ''

PROSTATE-CANCER-MED _ SAN DIEGO _ A blood test that helps detect prostate cancer has been very effective in detecting the disease in men of all ages .
But new research indicates that similar tests results do not necessarily mean similar outcomes in older and younger men .
Men ages 61 to 73 were consistently more likely to have less curable cancer when compared to younger men , even if their prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) levels were the same .
PSA is a protein made by the prostate and high levels indicate that the prostate is enlarged and possibly cancerous .
The PSA blood test and digital rectal exam are the most common methods used to detect prostate cancer .
The findings add to the debate over whether to continue testing men with raised PSA levels , according to lead researcher Dr. H. Ballentine Carter , an associate professor of urology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore .
The findings indicate that age may be an important guide in determining whether to further test men , Carter reported on Sunday here at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association .
`` PSA is a test commonly used in the detection of prostate cancer .
However , the threshold value that should prompt further evaluation is unclear , '' he said .
The Baltimore urologist noted that lowering the threshold may cause doctors to spot more harmless tumors , but raising the threshold might leave life-threatening cancers undetected .

HEALTH-ONLINE-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE MONDAY AT 5 P.M .
EASTERN _ Parents should be wary of health advice available on the Internet , a new study suggests .
Much of the medical information is incorrect or out of date , researchers reported in the June issue of the electronic edition of the journal Pediatrics .
Since just about anyone with a computer _ regardless of medical expertise _ can publish on the World Wide Web , `` it can present bad medicine on an equal plane with good , '' according to Dr. H. Juhling McClung of the Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health in Columbus .

DROWN-PREVENT-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE MONDAY AT 5 P.M .
EASTERN _ Fences can help keep young children away from swimming pools when adults are not around , but they do not prevent all drownings , a national survey shows .
The telephone poll of more than 5,200 adults showed that 76 percent of home and apartment pools had adequate fencing in 1994 .
But even if all pools had been properly fenced , the number of children younger than 5 years old who drowned would have only dropped by 19 percent , researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Atlanta reported in the June issue of the electronic edition of the journal Pediatrics .
