Iraq Accuses US , Britain of Suspending
BAGHDAD , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Baghdad on Sunday charged the U.S. and Britain of deliberate failing to implement the humanitarian purchases by Iraq .
The Iraqi news agency quoted a spokesman of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry as saying that the U.S. and British delegates have suspended 21 contracts included in the third phase of the oil-for-food deal .
The spokesman pointed out that the U.S. and British delegates are still blocking the enforcement of more purchase contracts , so much so that the number of suspended fourth phase contracts has reached 40 contracts .
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait , but has allowed it to sell a certain amount of oil to buy back food and medicines in six-month phases since the end of 1996 .
The spokesman indicated that among the suspended contracts are those for the purchase of foodstuffs , medicine and medical appliances , spare parts for the electricity sector , and equipment to treat potable and drainage waters .
He added that there are over 90 other contracts valued at 160 million U.S. dollars , but the financial coverage for these contracts are still hanging due to the delay by U.N. organs in transferring funds .
He asserted that this situation will obstruct the arrival of humanitarian equipment to Iraq , negatively affecting the planned distribution of monthly supplies and the provision of needed medicine to Iraqi citizens .
The spokesman also said the Iraqi government is calling upon the international community to pressure Washington and London to refrain from such practices which flagrantly violate all international and humanitarian conventions as well as the Iraqi-related Security Council resolutions .
