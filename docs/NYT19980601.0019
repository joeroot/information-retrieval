SINATRA : NOT A MYTH BUT A MAN , AND ONE AMONG MANY
( lb ) By MARGO JEFFERSON c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
Monotheism doesn n't suit the world of popular music ; that world has too many great performers .
The pleasure I have always taken in Frank Sinatra 's best singing is being tainted by the `` thou shalt have no other singer '' eulogies and by the cultural studies , conferences and papers still to come .
Rock ' n ' roll never stopped me from loving the truly wonderful Sinatra recordings of the 1950s .
And loving those recordings never stopped me from lamenting and resenting the songs , the singing and the persona that appeared in the mid - '60s and prevailed until his death .
The voice and the man grew coarse .
The easy swagger became belligerent , and the melancholy turned brashly sentimental .
Artists don n't need to be remembered for anything but their best work .
But they don n't need to have that work enshrined in a mythology that places them above all others and will soon pass into ( and pass itself off as ) history and criticism .
Jule Styne was a good songwriter , but how can anyone let his famous comment about Sinatra stand ?
Sinatra brought style to popular singing , Styne proclaimed : `` Before Sinatra , songs were just sung straight and without much panache .
Crosby had a little sense of style , but Sinatra was the one who went the whole way . ''
This is stupefying .
The tradition of popular and jazz singing that produced Sinatra was invented in the 1920s by Louis Armstrong , Bing Crosby and Ethel Waters , with major input from assorted blues , nightclub and musical-theater performers .
That tradition was extended and developed in the 1930s when Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald led the innovations , with significant contributions from Connee Boswell , Mildred Bailey , Lee Wiley and Jimmy Rushing .
( Rushing was largely a blues singer ; and it 's true that Sinatra didn n't sing blues .
But we 're going for a full aerial view here , and the blues , with its mingling of lyricism and bravado , is a crucial part of the mix . )
This was a golden age of singing , and it was filled _ crammed , bursting _ with panache , invention and all kinds of style .
It has been said that before Sinatra , singers tended to sound as though they barely knew the band they were working with .
And of course that was true of mediocre to bad singers .
It certainly wasn n't true of the singers just named .
Nor was it true of fine singers a cut or two below .
Ivie Anderson certainly knew Duke Ellington 's band , Helen Humes knew Count Basie 's and Helen Forrest knew Benny Goodman 's .
Sinatra was certainly the man when it came to reviving a big-band tradition that had all but capsized during World War II .
And when it came to what the critic Gary Giddins has aptly called the rhythmic midground between pop gentility and jazz swing , Sinatra had the taste , skill and clout to bring audiences there , away from a mainstream glutted with slush and treacle .
He wasn n't the first to discover that fruitful ground , but he retooled and refreshed it .
He didn n't invent dramatic naturalism either , but he deepened and extended its range and became our best singer in that tradition .
Peggy Lee is a close second .
Her phrasing and rhythm are just as good , her intonation is better , and she can trump him in subtlety , but she doesn n't have his vocal or temperamental force .
And let us not forget that there is another song tradition that Sinatra admired and learned from but does not belong in : the non-naturalistic , call it abstractly expressionist , tradition fathered by Armstrong and developed in quite different ways by Holiday , Fitzgerald and in Sinatra 's era by Nat `` King '' Cole .
Innovative jazz and mainstream popular music grew further and further apart in the 1940s and '50s .
Jazz singers still had their pop hits , but you certainly couldn n't say that singers like Anita O ' Day , Billy Eckstine , Sarah Vaughan or Mel Torme were at the center of the culture 's consciousness ; they were on its vigorous borders or in its vanguard .
Of the mainstream performers who made their names in the war and postwar years , Sinatra , Ms. Lee and Cole ( despite the trash he sometimes had to record ) were the hit makers who kept the jazz-pop links center stage .
( Doris Day was a very good singer , but she concentrated on movies , not recordings . )
Sinatra 's other great gift , of course , was his sexual charisma .
Whatever he sang , it was there .
The jaunty manliness was sexy ; so was the melancholy introspection ; so was the edgy rebelliousness one saw most clearly in his best film performances .
He was a star , and he had what real stars have : the ability to take their gifts , their limitations and their influences and mold them into a unified whole called My Personality .
The force of that personality is what makes Sinatra unforgettable .
But why claim , as some do , that Sinatra was the first popular singer to think of himself as an artist ?
Surely we don n't still believe , given the evidence of the work they put in ( the practicing , the jam sessions , the attention paid to opera singers , actors , horn players and their own own peers ) , that the masters of the preceding generation didn n't know they were artists .
Holiday , Armstrong and Mabel Mercer _ the English song-actress nonpareil whom Sinatra called a major influence along with Holiday and Tommy Dorsey _ all wore an armor of modesty in public , but that shouldn n't fool us anymore .
They knew their worth .
( STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
It has been very unpleasant reading these eulogies to see how segregated , racially and sexually , views of popular music remain .
And wearying to have to note that nearly all of the pre-Sinatra innovators who are left out of this musical hagiography are blacks and women .
In my generation this is called the Elvis Presley syndrome .
The setting : a fertile but largely unformed musical world .
The action : He arrives .
It makes one remember that preferential treatment based on race and gender has always been the norm in American life ; it is only the beneficiaries who have changed in the last few decades .
For all of his talent and drive , Sinatra benefited greatly from the preferential treatment given his race and gender , as if by natural right in those days .
( So , for all of his greatness as a dancer , did Fred Astaire . ) Not only did Sinatra have unparalleled power in the music industry , but he got to act out a lavish drama of masculinity that thrilled the entire culture .
What black man could have gotten away with such cocky brashness and become a star of that magnitude ?
( Witness the unusually passive public demeanor of Cole . ) What woman of either race could have ?
They simply could not have seized the imagination and approval of a mass audience with such open displays of power and nose-thumbing .
Sinatra was a great performer because he joined kinetic musical force to what looked and sounded like pure naturalism .
It was also his great good fortune to come of age in a time when the world still considered whiteness and maleness the best and most natural of states .
