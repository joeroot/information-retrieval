Two Advertisers Decide on Accounts
Two advertisers have made decisions on their accounts .
Moviefone Inc. named Mad Dogs and Englishmen in New York to handle its account in a review that began in March , when Ryan Drossman & AMP ; Partners in New York , Moviefone 's first agency , said it was leaving the account after almost eight years .
The review , managed by Sound Thinking , a New York consulting company , had been narrowed to Mad Dogs and two other New York-based finalists : the Grey Entertainment unit of Grey Advertising and Margeotes / Fertitta & AMP ; Partners .
Moviefone 's annual budget is estimated at more than $ 25 million in a combination of paid spending and barter , ads run in exchange for radio time or newspaper space .
Andrew Jarecki , chief executive of Moviefone in New York , said Mad Dogs would develop strategy and consumer and trade campaigns for the telephone service as well as the sibling online service , Movielink.com ( www.movielink.com ) .
And Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon Inc. named Levenson & AMP ; Hill in Dallas as the first agency to handle its advertising .
Though billings were not disclosed , Adweek estimated them at $ 15 million to $ 20 million .
John D. White , executive vice president and chief financial officer at Lone Star in Wichita , Kan. , said that Levenson & AMP ; Hill got the account after a review lasting two and a half months , but he declined to disclose the other participants .
Among the possible contenders listed by Adweek were DeVito / Verdi in New York , the New York office of Earle Palmer Brown and Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis .
