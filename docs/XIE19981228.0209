Sichuan Strikes Hard at Illicit Logging
CHENGDU , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Southwest China 's Sichuan Province has been tough on illicit logging activities since the promulgation of the province 's anti-logging order at the beginning of September .
The Provincial Forestry department said that since September 1 , it has handled 33 cases of violations of the order , with six of the accused detained and one arrested .
" Most of those cases took place before the order was issued , but were reported to the government by local people after the promulgation of the order , " said Yu Shufeng , a provincial forest department official .
Yu attributed the reports to an improved environmental awareness among ordinary citizens and the popularity of China 's forest protection project in the hearts of the people .
Although more than 17,000 forest-related cases occurred in the province in 1998 , the number of cases which took place after the issuance of the new anti-logging order dropped significantly .
