U.S. Senators Urge Speedy Impeachment Proceedings
WASHINGTON , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Several Republicans of the U.S. Senate say censure should be considered only after a speedy impeachment trial , and perhaps only after a vote on whether to remove President Bill Clinton from office .
" We ought to vote on these articles of impeachment , and then that is the appropriate time to consider a censure , " Senator Mitch McConnell , a Republican , said on " Fox News Sunday . "
" Assuming neither of those articles pass , which is what 's widely expected will be the outcome ...
you sit down and you negotiate the censure alternative , " he said .
Significant questions remain over whether a deal for censuring the president can be worked out before a trial begins .
There is , however , widespread agreement among Republicans and Democrats that any trial should be quick , given that senators of both parties widely agree that there 's little chance that the chamber will vote to convict and remove Clinton .
Without the 67 votes needed , Senate leaders then would " come up with the strongest censure resolution there is , " Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch , a Republican , said on CBS ' " Face the Nation . "
Democrats , Meanwhile , are pushing for a strongly worded censure to punish Clinton for his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter .
But Republicans are insisting on trying Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges passed along party lines by the House .
Senators of both parties agreed on one thing during their appearances on the Sunday talk shows : They , like most Americans , want the matter disposed of swiftly .
Several senators on Sunday suggested that the trial conclude by March , the traditional starting time for the full Senate 's legislative work .
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has said the chamber has a constitutional responsibility to at least open such proceedings .
