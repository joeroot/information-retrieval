Guangzhou Port Channels Deepened
GUANGZHOU , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- An ambitious dredging program is under way at the port of Guangzhou , the largest foreign trade outlet of fast-developing south China .
The two-year plan , which got underway last weekend , is designed to expand a 58.6-kilometer section of the 115-kilometer navigation channels leading ships from the port at the mouth of the Pearl River out to the open sea .
After completion , the section 's width will be expanded to 160 meters and a depth to 11.5 meters , enabling the passing of 35,000-ton ships round the clock , and 50,000-ton ships when the tide is high .
As a result , the handling capacity of the port will be raised to 85 to 90 million tons from the 78 million tons projected for this year , port officials said .
The central government , and the Guangdong provincial and Guangzhou city governments will jointly invest a total of 750 million yuan ( 90.36 million U.S. dollars ) in the project , which is expected to dredge 40 million cubic meters of silt out of the channels .
The project was decided on as it became apparent that the present channels have become inadequate to cope with the growing commerce of the port .
Preparations for the dredging began as early as 1996 .
