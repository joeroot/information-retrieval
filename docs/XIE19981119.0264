Bank of Thailand Sees Stable Baht for Rest of Year
BANGKOK , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Following U.S. rate cuts , the dollar / baht exchange rate is likely to trade in a small band between 36 and 37 baht which will not affect exports , Bank of Thailand 's Assistant Governor Kietisak Meechareon said Wednesday .
The baht does not tend to move rapidly against the dollar , the Bangkok Post Thursday quoted Kietisak as saying .
" I personally estimate it should be somewhere around 36 - 37 baht a dollar until the year end , " he said .
" Judging that the interest rate cut did not have much impact on the dollar , the market still has a bullish sentiment on the U.S. currency . "
The recent appreciation of the baht has been driven by the weakening of the dollar to the yen .
The central bank has intervened from time to time , to minimize fluctuations in the baht 's exchange rate , Kietisak said .
He said the United States decided to cut rates in an attempt to " get ahead of the curve " and minimize the chance of an international economic slowdown .
The fact that the U.S. economy has yet to show signs of a slowdown and investors believe the Japanese financial reform package will not yield short-term gains has helped sustain the dollar , Kietisak said .
