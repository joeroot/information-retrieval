STREET VENDORS SAY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS THREATENED
( js ) By MIKE ALLEN c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ Broadening their efforts to limit what they see as dangerous congestion on New York City 's sidewalks , city officials said Monday that their vending ban would include not only food carts but also street sales of books , baseball cards , art , T-shirts and all other goods .
The ambitious enforcement plan targets yet another signature of the Manhattan streetscape and potentially courts a First Amendment battle , according to opponents of the restrictions .
The widening of the ban also gives food vendors a host of potential new allies as they seek to build opposition to the rules by staging a citywide shutdown of the carts on Wednesday .
The new restrictions , to be enforced by the police beginning in about mid-July , cover 144 blocks of Manhattan , including much of the financial district and several stretches of midtown .
In the past , the city has designated some areas where food vending was prohibited and others where vending of general merchandise like clothing was banned .
Peddlers of books and other printed matter were accorded the widest latitude because of their First Amendment rights .
But Earl Andrews Jr. , chairman of the city 's Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel , which approved the 144-block ban , said the restrictions approved by the panel applied to vendors of both food and general merchandise , and thus covered artists and those who sell printed matter .
`` If a street is congested , it 's going to be congested , whether it 's a food vendor or a general vendor , '' said Andrews , who is commissioner of the Department of Business Services .
`` All vending should exist in an area where there is no congestion and no threat to the safety of the citizens and the flow of traffic . ''
Street artists , who have been persistent critics of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , said they would join the food vendors in a demonstration that is to begin at 9 a.m. Wednesday in City Hall Park , to be followed with a lunchtime march to Wall Street and back .
Robert Lederman , president of Artists ' Response to Illegal State Tactics , said the wider ban would mean that `` fundamental elements of free speech and alternative expression '' would be `` the next casualty in the mayor 's quality of life campaign . ''
`` This is not just about hot dogs , '' Lederman said .
`` Mayor Giuliani 's war on vendors is virtually eliminating free expression from large areas of New York City 's public streets . ''
Gabriel Taussig , the chief of the administrative law division of the city 's Law Department , said peddlers of books and other printed matter , including collectors ' cards , were exempt from city regulations requiring vendors to be licensed .
But he said the city was allowed to place limits on their displays _ for instance , how much space they take up on a sidewalk and their proximity to a subway entrance .
Under the same rationale , he said , the city could limit the streets on which the vendors could set up .

In the case of street artists , Taussig said that under a 1996 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , the artists have the same rights as book vendors .
`` The legal principle is that we have to give the greatest deference to vendors engaged in First Amendment activity , '' Taussig said .
The standard has been that book vendors were disallowed in places where both food and general-merchandise vendors were prohibited .
The administration officials were elaborating on comments that Giuliani had made at a news conference earlier Monday , when he had seemed to doubt whether the city could impose the same restrictions on book merchants that it would impose on food carts .
Asked whether the regulations would also apply to book vendors , the mayor said : `` The rules apply to food vendors .
The rules with regard to book vendors are different because of their additional First Amendment protection . ''
City Councilman Anthony Weiner , a Brooklyn Democrat who has called for the abolition of the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel , said the broad enforcement was `` intellectually consistent '' on the part of the administration but that it put Giuliani in a potential `` legal thicket . ''
Wiener charged that the review panel 's decisions were arbitrary and were targeted in many cases at neighborhoods where `` sophisticated lobbying '' resulted in vendor bans .
`` The result is a process built more on politics than on public safety , '' Weiner said .
`` Although courts may allow that when it comes to buying a hot dog , they can be expected to have a higher standard when it comes to the First Amendment . ''
Andrews , the chairman of the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel , said the official list of vending restrictions would be published by the city in two to three weeks .
Enforcement is to begin 30 days after that .
He said many areas would remain open to vending , and asserted that the availability of goods `` is not going to drastically change at all . ''
`` Vendors are a part of the fabric of New York , '' Andrews said .
`` We are not trying to stop vending .
We are only regulating it . ''
On June 17 , the vendor review panel will begin reviewing a second round of petitions for more bans on vending .
On Friday , officials made available 40 petitions covering 95 blocks of Manhattan , filed by a broad array of New York institutions , from the Museum of Modern Art to Lenox Hill Hospital .
Andrews said at least 25 more petitions had been received .
The Big Apple Food Vendors Association , which is organizing Wednesday 's march , said 2,000 more corners were at risk of being restricted .
The mayor 's staff discounted that figure as a wild exaggeration .
