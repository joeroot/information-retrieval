YANKEES EDGE WHITE SOX IN 10 TH , 5 - 4

NEW YORK _ The Yankees , the team with the best record in baseball and , therefore , the fewest problems , don n't often have to sweat the details .
But lose two games in a row and even the Yankees encounter some turbulence .
So it was Monday night when even baseball 's best were beset with niggling little questions .
Could Ramiro Mendoza stop creeping concerns about a couple of the Yankees starters , including himself ?
Could Tino Martinez shake the 0-for-12 slump he had found since coming back from the injurious hit laid on him by an Armando Benitez fastball ?
Finally , could the team recover after watching not only Mike Stanton but Mariano Rivera blow saves after the Yankees had come within six outs of beating the visiting White Sox Monday night ?
The answer proved to be a resounding yes to all the questions , because Tim Raines and Chad Curtis _ two Yankees seemingly always above question _ combined a two-out walk and a double into the left-field corner to bring the Yankees a 5 - 4 victory in 10 innings .
Raines scored all the way from first as Curtis ended a night in which he had also homered by delivering the winning hit against Chicago reliever Matt Karchner .
One day after the Yankees had lost a second straight game for only the third time this season , there was little introspection among the members of the winningest team in the major leagues .
That 's the way manager Joe Torre prefers it .
Torre 's preference was clear when asked whether he was concerned about Andy Pettitte .
The left-hander 's record fell to 6 - 5 and he saw his earned run average balloon to 4.88 after allowing eight earned runs in a 13 - 7 loss to the Boston Red Sox on Sunday .
Torre insists that he will be concerned only if Pettitte is concerned , dismissing easy answers such as injury or overt consternation over being away from his wife and two children , one a newborn .
`` I think people look for reasons as to why things happen , '' Torre said Monday .
`` Very few of us are satisfied that it could be a slump , and just let it go at that .
You 've got to just dissect it all the time . ''
Torre obviously is reluctant to put Pettitte 's psyche on the slab .
`` Like I said with Bernie Williams a month ago , if he 's concerned , I 'm concerned , '' the manager said .
`` And I 'm not concerned about him because he 's too good of a pitcher .
And his stuff is good .
Right now I think it 's more overpreparation .
He 's trying to do too much .
It 's got to be more of a mental thing than anything else . ''
That does not mean the Yankees ' machine is not searching for answers , dissecting things in the video room , according to the owner George Steinbrenner .
After revealing that the Yankees ' staff has met and reviewed tapes of Pettitte 's starts , Steinbrenner , saying that `` Pettitte is my main concern , '' went on to say : `` We think we have discovered a a couple of things .
Baseball films are great . ''
Though Steinbrenner would not specify what the revelations were , the team 's principal owner said , `` The Yankees ' staff is going to sit down here soon and discuss whatever these are , '' adding that Pettitte would likely be amenable to whatever suggestions come out of the video sessions .
The findings would be news to Torre , who said he was unaware of the viewing sessions or the results .
When asked whether his staff was involved , Torre said no. When asked whether it was likely that the Yankees ' officials at the team 's complex in Tampa , Fla. , where Steinbrenner has his business headquarters , were the ones involved , Torre said : `` Must be .
I don n't know anything about it . ''
Pettitte met with Torre and the pitching coach , Mel Stottlemyre , informally on the field during batting practice before Monday night 's game .
`` We just basically talked , '' the pitcher said .
`` They just wanted to pick my brain .
I 'm doing fine .
There are no miracle cures .
I just have to keep on going out and throwing . ''
Pettitte said he watched tapes of his performance against the Red Sox a few times .
`` I had real good stuff , then I gave up a walk and it almost looked like I got real tentative , '' he said .
George Steinbrenner analyzed more than just Andy Pettitte Monday .
He also took a look at the Yankees ' two-game losing streak , which resulted in a split of the four-game series against the visiting Red Sox last weekend .
`` We 've had an outstanding start , '' Steinbrenner said of the Yankees , who carried the majors ' best record ( 37 - 13 ) into Monday night 's game .
`` We 'll be very difficult to catch .
It 's possible , but it 's going to be very difficult . ''
Even so , Steinbrenner , who termed `` winning the most important thing in my life other than breathing , '' said the weekend losses were `` a little wake-up call . ''
`` It was good for us , '' he said .
`` They realize they 've got to do more than just throw their gloves out there . ''
The Yankees scored a double coup Monday when Bernie Williams and Hideki Irabu were named player and pitcher of month in the American League for May .
Williams led the league in batting ( . 402 ) , slugging ( . 729 ) and on-base percentage last month .
Irabu went 4 - 1 with a league-leading 1.44 earned run average .
In six starts he pitched 43 2 / 3 innings , second in the league , and gave up only 25 hits .
The Yankees ' Derek Jeter ( 44 hits , tops in the league in May ) and David Wells ( perfect game , 4 - 0 for the month ) also received consideration in their categories .
Gabby Martinez , the shortstop at the Yankees ' Class AAA affiliate in Columbus , was put on the inactive list for `` personal reasons , '' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said .
