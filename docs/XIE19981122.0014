ECOWAS to Name Special Envoy to G. Bissau
LAGOS , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- A special envoy will be appointed by the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) to supervise the implementation of the Abuja peace accord in Guinea Bissau , the ECOWAS Secretariat said Saturday .
It said in a statement issued in Nigerian capital Abuja that this was decided Thursday when ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate met with Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema , the newly-elected ECOWAS chairman .
The talks were centered on the deployment of the ECOWAS intervention force ECOMOG in Guinea Bissau , in accordance with the peace deal signed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader General Ansumane Mane .
The peace deal , signed in Abuja shortly after the 21st ECOWAS summit , confirmed an earlier cease-fire agreement and provided for the establishment of a unity government and presidential elections in March 1999 .
ECOMOG Commander Major-General Tomothy Shelpidi has earlier paid a visit to Guinea Bissau , to review the situation there and assess the needs for the logistics and troop requirements for the proposed peace-keeping operation .
