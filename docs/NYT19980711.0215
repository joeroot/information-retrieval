MINNESOTANS DON ' T TRUST MCCOMBS
( For use by N.Y .
Times News Service clients ) By STEVE SCHOENFELD c.1998 The Arizona Republic
A Twin Cities fan walked into a Bloomington , Minn. , sporting goods store last week and asked for some San Antonio Vikings gear .
San Antonio Vikings ?
`` It was late at night , '' said & UR ; Dan Owens , sales clerk at Goldy 's Locker Room at the Mall of America .
`` I didn n't quite grasp it at first .
Once it hit me , I laughed and thought , ` OK , whatever . ' I knew the guy was joking . ''
But the bigger question is whether prospective Vikings owner & UR ; Red & UR ; McCombs is serious when he says he has no plans to move the team to his hometown of San Antonio and play in the Alamodome .
`` I went to the corner store the other night ( in Minneapolis ) and a girl behind the cash register told me , ' So , you 're buying the Vikings , but you 're not moving them to San Antonio , ' '' McCombs said , `` and then she gave a little wink .
`` So that ( kind of talk ) is not going to go away . ''
Vikings fans are understandably skeptical .
Owner & UR ; Norm Green moved the NHL 's Minnesota North Stars to Dallas in 1993 .
The NBA 's Minnesota Timberwolves were sold to boxing promoter & UR ; Bob Arum to move to New Orleans in 1994 , but the NBA rejected the move .
Last year , Minnesota Twins owner & UR ; Carl Pohlad threatened to move the major league baseball team to North Carolina .
McCombs has been trying to get San Antonio an NFL franchise for years , and , already , there is talk of a Vikings preseason game there in 1999 against the New Orleans Saints , owned by another San Antonio car dealer , & UR ; Tom Benson .
An editorial in the `` San Antonio Express-News '' said McCombs ' ownership of the Vikings will help San Antonio get an NFL team .
The editorial didn n't say which team .
`` Express-News '' columnist & UR ; David King revealed facts about Minnesota `` that don n't beg the team to stay . ''
Minnesota 's main body of water , Lake Superior , is the temperature of an average glass of ice water .
Texas has the Gulf of Mexico year-round .
Minnesota has an official state muffin , blueberry , and an official state mushroom , the morel .
King also wrote the top 10 reasons why `` Texas is better than Minnesota '' or `` why Red 's purple team should be playing here . ''
Here are a few : _ 10 .
Visitors walk along our river during the winter , not across it .

Five words : Last freeze date , April 1.
8.
In Texas , our mosquitos are insects ; in Minnesota , they are referred to as the state bird .
7.
Minnesota 's stadium ( Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome ) was named after a guy who was vice president _ under a Texan .
6.
We 've got more professional hockey teams ( we 're gon na have a team in Abilene _ Abilene ?
_ next season ) .
McCombs , the 70-year-old former owner of the NBA 's San Antonio Spurs , will be a big change from the committee that ran the Vikings .
`` It 's pretty hard to cuss out a committee , '' McCombs said .
`` I think it 's very important for the fans to know there is one guy who is ultimately in charge .
They want to be able to say , ` That damn Red , he screwed it up . '
`` .

Where I grew up in Texas , there were a lot of sayings we had , and one of them was , ` Don n't squat with your spurs on . ' Although it carries a lot of connotations , it means , ` Don n't screw up . ' '' & QL ; & QL ; Money talks
Don n't feel sorry for quarterback & UR ; Neil O ' Donnell , signed by the Cincinnati Bengals after being cut last month by the New York Jets .
He made $ 11.75 million with the Jets the past two years and will get $ 5.15 million from them this year .
So O ' Donnell will have earned $ 17 million the past three years , $ 2.3 million more than Dallas Cowboys quarterback & UR ; Troy Aikman has made during the same time .
& QL ; & QL ; Running feud
The Cowboys will be the first NFL team to open training camp when they report Wednesday to Wichita Falls , Texas .
It will be the first year the team has trained in Wichita Falls after being in Austin the past eight years .
`` Texas Monthly '' writes that the team is in for a shock when it sees its new training camp surroundings near the Oklahoma border .
Writer & UR ; Skip Hollandsworth , a Wichita Falls native , said the heat there is `` as heavy as wool '' and `` after sweating under the sun for an afternoon , you start smelling like road kill . ''
Wrote Hollandsworth : `` If you spend too much time outside , the temperature of your blood starts to rise , your vision blurs and your legs start quivering like dying fish on hooks . ''
He also wrote that the dancers in Wichita Falls ' topless bars are heavier than the Dallas players .
The `` Wichita Falls Times Record '' struck back on its editorial page .
`` Of course , it 's hot here , '' wrote editor & UR ; Carroll Wilson , `` and that 's the way we like it , us and the 103,000 other souls who believe there 's more to a city than interminable traffic tie-ups , indefatigable drug dealers and insufferably smug magazine editors .
And if you can n't take the heat .

& QL ; & QL ; Short shots
Cowboys Pro Bowl cornerback & UR ; Deion Sanders still is slowed by a left ankle injury he suffered playing racquetball two months ago .
Rookie quarterback & UR ; Ryan Leaf of the San Diego Chargers could be fined as much as $ 10,000 for leaving the NFL 's mandatory rookie symposium a day early last week in Denver .
He left to to speak at a former college teammate 's camp .
