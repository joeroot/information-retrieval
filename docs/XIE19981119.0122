Iraq Urges Security Council to React to
BAGHDAD , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraq on Thursday urged the United Nations Security Council to react to U.S. President Bill Clinton 's call for toppling the Iraqi government .
The Al-Thawra daily , mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party , demanded the Security Council practice its ethical and legal responsibilities towards Clinton 's public incitement for overthrowing Iraq 's legitimate government .
The paper said in an editorial that Clinton 's statement was " a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter , the international laws , as well as an interference in Iraq 's internal affairs . "
Clinton said on Sunday that Washington would support the efforts of Iraqi oppositions to overthrow the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein while announcing that Iraq had narrowly averted a military strike by backing down from its defiance of U.N. arms inspectors .
The editorial said the Security Council " must not keep silent and ignore this violation and let it go without thinking of its dangerous consequences on the international community . "
" This negligence will encourage the United States and other countries to violate the international laws and give the U.S. license to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries , " it warned .
The editorial pointed out that Clinton 's statement is a hard evidence of U.S. position on the sanctions aimed at weakening Iraq 's potentials .
The U.S. insists that the lifing of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait be linked not only with Iraq 's disarmament , but also with other time-consuming issues such as the release of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and human rights .
Iraq agreed on Saturday to unconditional resumption of U.N. weapons inspections , defusing the standoff with the U.N. over its October 31 decision to halt all cooperations with U.N. arms inspectors .
U.N. arms inspectors resumed their work in Iraq on Wednesday .
