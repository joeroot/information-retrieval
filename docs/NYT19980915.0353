ATLANTA -- The stock market posted its first three-day rally in more than a month as major indexes showed across-the-board gains on Tuesday .
Blue chips led the way .
Analysts attributed the rally to a combination of optimism that the Federal Reserve might cut short-term interest rates , bargain hunting in the wake of recent market losses and relief that Kenneth Starr 's report revealed no new surprises about President Clinton .
The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average , which dropped below its Dec. 31 , 1997 , closing price on Aug. 31 , traded above that level for the second straight session on Tuesday .
But the year-to-date rise of 1.5 percent was still well below the Dow 's 18.1 percent year-to-date gain on July 17 , when the index closed at an all-time high of 9 , 337.97 .
The market 's comeback from its Aug. 31 sell-off was sparked by a Sept. 4 speech by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , which was widely interpreted as a signal the Fed might be ready to cut short-term rates .
Investors have another long-shot chance to get a clue to the direction of interest rates today when Greenspan testifies before the House Banking Committee .
Analysts note Greenspan usually is noncommital about rate changes , and is not expected to give any information away before the Fed 's next policy meeting Sept. 29 .
In separate remarks , President Robert Parry of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank said Tuesday that the financial situation in South America is of growing concern , although the Fed 's chief focus internationally is Japan and its effort to implement fiscal and financial reforms .
In Tuesday 's trading , bank , airline and drug stocks rose again , along with shares of paper and forest products companies .
Even some cyclical stocks such as Aluminum Company of America and Caterpillar posted gains .
The Nasdaq composite index made a solid gain on buying in the technology sector , but smaller-capitalized stocks underperformed the rest of the market with only a fractional increase .
Investors showed little reaction to a report showing retail sales rose a mild 0.2 percent in August after dropping by 0.6 percent during July , when the General Motors strike was cutting into auto sales .
Meanwhile , the market continued to suffer from `` pre-announcements '' of disappointing third-quarter earnings news .
The latest came from Suiza Food Corp. , one of the nation 's largest dairy companies , which warned that sharply higher costs will cut into its profits for the rest of the year .
Analysts have said all along that the underlying cause of the current bear market is the sharp decline in profit growth , caused in part by repercussions from Asia 's financial crisis .
Not only are more earnings disappointments expected , Friday is the next `` triple witching '' session , when stock options , index options and index futures expire , usually adding to the market 's volatility .
