China Ready for Treasury Bond Redemption
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's related departments have made ample preparations for redeeming treasury bonds due this year , according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance .
The spokesman said that the ministry has allocated sufficient funds for this year 's treasury bond redemption , which will begin on March 1.
This year 's amount of principal and interest repayment will be the biggest ever in China 's treasury bond history .
Altogether six kinds of bonds will be mature this year , while another five kinds of bonds , though not mature , will need to pay the annual interests .
The spokesman said the redemption of treasury bonds will be well organized through multi channels , with various special services offered to provide convenience for bond holders .
The redemption of treasury bonds due last year has been basically finished , the spokesman said .
China began to issue treasury bonds in the early 1980s .
Since then a large amount of funds have been raised to support the country 's economic development .
Successful redemption over the past years has won a high credit for the country 's treasury bonds .
