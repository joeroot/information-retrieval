FRESNO , Calif. _ Talk about political culture shock .
A day after votes were counted in the Northern Ireland peace referendum , I flew from Belfast to San Francisco to catch the final week of the California primary campaign .
After a month immersed in the low-tech modesty of Irish politics ( and writing about it for The New York Times ) , I was greeted at the airport by an electronic stand-in for the mayor and chief municipal showboat , Willie Brown Jr. In a message that boomed from above , and over and over , in the international arrivals terminal , Brown introduced himself and welcomed each and every visitor ( and prospective voter ) to what he grandly called `` My city . ''
Had I not been in Ireland 14 hours earlier , I would not have thought twice about this bold piece of self-promotion by a politician who is not even up for re-election .
But I arrived in California with a fresh perspective : Only days earlier , strategists for the Yes campaign in Northern Ireland bickered for 20 minutes ( with reporters in the room , no less ) over whether it would appear too cynical to print T-shirts with a big , bold , `` YES '' emblazoned across the front .
( They went ahead with the idea and it did not seem to put off voters ; the referendum passed easily . )
It may seem unfair to compare two election campaigns that not only are half a world apart but could not be more different .
In Ireland , voters were trying to resolve one of the bloodiest , most enduring conflicts of this century .
The voting in California on Tuesday is , to put it gently , not nearly as historic .
Voters here are being asked to elect nominees for governor , the Senate and the House , and choose an array of initiatives and local candidates .
Important ?
Sure .
War and peace ?
No.
Even so , for a reporter who has witnessed dozens of American elections over the last two decades , watching the campaign unfold in Ireland was a refreshing civics lesson , if also an ultimately depressing one .
While the Irish appeared hopelessly , even laughably , naieve about how to campaign , their approach seemed closer to genuine democracy .
By contrast , the American system looks worse than ever .
The inability of politicians to break through to American voters has been an undercurrent of campaigns for years , particularly in California , where the beaches are a more powerful draw than politics .
But the depth of indifference here is even more striking when contrasted to Ireland .
While people there were not particularly optimistic that the referendum would change anything , they had enough hope in their politicians and the process that they were not about to pass on voting altogether .
By contrast , Californians simply don n't think it 's important to vote .
After a reasonably deep conversation here last week with a friend who is well educated and well-versed in current events ( he once lived in Washington ) , he asked , `` When 's the election , anyway ? ''
It was a question I never encountered _ not once _ in hundreds of conversations in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
Some politicians groused that the turnout in the Irish Republic was only about 60 percent of the voting-age population .
In California , experts predict turnout could sink below 30 percent .
While it is to be expected that voting for the more consequential Ulster peace accord would draw more attention , the Irish turnout was no anomaly .
Irish voting has remained relatively constant over the years , while turnout in California keeps dwindling .
In Belfast I mocked the primitive way in which the campaign was conducted .
Rather than buying television commercials , both sides fought with rudimentary placards hung on lampposts .
The Yes campaign 's poster was a particularly easy object of ridicule .
It was intended to look like a road sign , but instead resembled an eye examination chart .
Here , by contrast , candidates for governor and Senate have pumped tens of millions of dollars into pelting one another with 30-second commercials that , with their screaming red headlines and threatening attacks , are intended to sway the tiny minority that will actually vote .
After nearly a week of exposure to those pitches , I still do not feel I have a grasp of just what these politicians would do if elected .
In Ireland there was no political television advertising , but the referendum dominated news and public affairs programs .
In California it is possible to watch hours of local news here without knowing there is an election on Tuesday .
American voters and political reporters , wise to the techniques of modern politics , are often numb to the consequences of campaign by focus group .
So it was cheering to visit a place where even a whiff of manipulation rankled voters .
The biggest controversy involving strategy in the Irish campaign came when the press got hold of a memorandum written by the communications director of the Northern Ireland Office of the British government that outlined how to win passage of the referendum .
By American standards , the memorandum was pretty tame , with suggestions of a `` daily handling meeting '' to plot strategy for `` exerting some influence on the content and quality of media coverage . ''
There was such outrage over what people viewed as unprecedented manipulation that the Northern Ireland Office backed off some of its plans .
`` I thought it was unremarkable , '' Kathleen Stevens , the United States Consul General in Northern Ireland , said of the document .
`` But it did a lot of damage .
It made everybody shy . ''
Contrast that to campaigns here , where every uttered word , every slogan is tested and vetted and tested again .
Al Checchi , a multimillionaire businessmen seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , started his advertising by not mentioning his party and making broad bipartisan appeals .
Then he abruptly shifted , presenting himself as a proud Democrat .
No one thinks Checchi 's turnabout reflected a genuine change of heart .
Voters in Ireland were refreshing to interview because , while they were suspicious about the peace treaty itself , there was little grousing about politicians or the political process .
Virtually every person I confronted on the street for any interview was cheerful and happy to talk .
One elderly couple invited me to their house for tea on Election Day .
The friendliness no doubt reflects the culture , even in a place where people have been at war for years .
But it also may reflect the fact that people in Ireland do not live in a world of 30-second attack commercials .
Irish voters may hate each other , but this time , at least , their politics wasn n't hateful .
My journey to Ireland left me longing for a simpler American politics , one where heartfelt speeches mean more than television spots , where it is possible to interview a candidate without having to calibrate the gap between spin and truth .
Like the Irish , I hope things will change .
Like them , I doubt they will .
In the meantime , I 'll dwell on the benefits of this country 's high-tech wizardry .
In Ireland , we had to wait an excruciating day for officials to tally yes-or-no ballots .
There is no such dallying in this land of short attention spans .
As I write this sentence , the experts have already projected most of the victors on Tuesday .
Come Wednesday , I 'll be long gone , on to the next campaign .
