India 's Rating Cut by Japanese Agency
NEW DELHI , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Japan Rating & AMP ; Investment Information Inc. has downgraded India 's sovereign rating by a notch to BBB , citing the inflexible fiscal deficit and weak current account structure , Business Standard said here Thursday .
The Japanese credit rating agency said in a press statement Wednesday that it " removed the foreign currency long-term rating of India from the rating monitor scheme and downgraded it from BBB + to BBB .
It also lowered ratings for Samurai bonds issued by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ) and Industrial Development Bank of India ( IDBI ) .
ONGC and IDBI bonds have also been removed from the rating monitor scheme and downgraded from BBB + to BBB .
ONGC had issued Samurai bonds worth 30 billion yen while IDBI had raised funds through two series worth 50 billion yen .
The Japanese rating agency said the downgrading reflects India 's narrowing fiscal flexibility , which could put pressure on the government 's policies on various economic issues .
It also reflects India 's weakening current account structure , which has been affected by the deteriorating external economic environment .
It said a reduction of subsidies and downsizing of the public sector is essential to improve the fiscal position , but there are no signs of the political leadership aiming for this .
