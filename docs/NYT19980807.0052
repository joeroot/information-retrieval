A SLOW START DOESN ' T KEEP FOLEY DOWN

PHILADELPHIA _ The New York Jets began the 30th anniversary of their Super Bowl year Thursday night with the first string dominating the Philadelphia Eagles .
Then the backups got sloppy in the second half as the Eagles made comeback noises .
But Ray Lucas , playing quarterback , led a 66-yard drive in the second half that restored a double-digit lead for the Jets as they went on to a 29 - 15 victory .
For Jets watchers , the attention was on quarterback Glenn Foley and his role as starter .
It began badly but picked up dramatically .
He was a mere 1 - 7 in his first eight attempts .
He overthrew Kyle Brady , he underthrew Dedric Ward and he was wide on a pass to Wayne Chrebet .
But he warmed up in the second quarter to lead the Jets on an 81-yard drive that ended with a Richie Anderson 1-yard run and a 10 - 3 lead .
Foley then rested with a little more than six minutes remaining until the half .
Vinny Testaverde replaced him and drilled a 39-yard completion to Alex Van Dyke in his first pass as a Jet .
It helped produce John Hall 's second field goal of the game as the Jets took a 13 - 3 halftime lead .
By the time Testaverde 's night was over , he had smartly completed 7-of-11 passes for 94 yards , including a touchdown to the rookie tight end Blake Spence .
For Foley 's one and a half periods of play , he had helped the Jets produce a field goal and a touchdown , and had connected on 6-of-13 passes for 67 yards .
They were a key factor as Coach Bill Parcells increased his record in preseason play to 40 - 14 , amassed with the Jets , New York Giants and New England Patriots .
Last year the Jets were 4 - 0 in the summer games , when Foley came off the bench twice in relief of Neil O ' Donnell to lead the Jets to victory .
Now O ' Donnell is a Cincinnati Bengal and a visitor to New York , facing the Giants on Saturday night .
Foley ?
He talks and acts like the Jets ' new leader .

Foley 's protection was fairly stable throughout his time on the field , although he was sacked once .
`` I wanted to be patient , '' Foley said of his slow start .
`` And when you run like we did , it makes it easier .
I thought we did pretty well .
We didn n't turn the ball over .
I had time .
I was just sitting back there all alone . ''
His touchdown drive saw him hit four of five passes , including a clutch 15-yarder to Ward on third-and-14 .
Finally , Anderson , who was starting for Curtis Martin and was battling Robert Farmer for a tailback spot , went over .
Martin was kept out with a hamstring injury , although he did dress .
Considering that the Jets ' most noted offensive weapon was absent , the Jets ' first team still had command of the Eagles .
The surge by blocking up the middle , led by their new center Kevin Mawae , was significant in giving Anderson 66 yards in 14 carries .
The Jets ' early lead was preserved at the halftime whistle when Ray Mickens blocked Chris Boniol 's field-goal attempt .
Meanwhile , Ward continued his fine summer as he duels with Van Dyke to become the club 's No. 3 receiver behind Keyshawn Johnson and Chrebet .
In last year 's exhibition opener against the Eagles , Ward , a rookie , produced 79 yards on three kickoff returns , 22 more on a punt return , and scored the crushing touchdown on a 33-yard pass from Foley .
But he had rookie problems , such as not knowing which lanes to run in , and he was used sparingly during the season .
Thursday night , though , his 37-yard kickoff return to start the second half positioned a touchdown drive that culminated with Testaverde 's 12-yard pass to Spence .
In his first two drives leading the Jets , Testaverde helped produce 10 points .
On his touchdown drive , Fred Baxter was leveled by a helmet-to-helmet hit by Matt Stevens near the goal line .
Baxter held on to the ball , and Stevens was handed an unnecessary roughness penalty .
The Eagles cut the Jets ' lead to 20 - 9 in the third quarter with a solid drive as Koy Detmer hit Kaseem Sinceno for a 19-yard score .
But Boniol 's extra-point attempt was no good .
Then Stevens picked up a Farmer fumble and returned it for a touchdown , and the Jets ' lead dwindled to 20 - 15 .
As for Parcells , his reaction was mixed .
`` It was a typical first game , '' he said , feigning unhappiness .
`` Some rookies were looking around as if they belonged , but they didn n't . ''
Parcells did , however , single out the special teams for several big plays .
EXTRA POINTS :
The Jets often showed a 3 - 4 defense and also blitzed off a 4 - 3 , confusing the Eagles and forcing quarterback Bobby Hoying into repeated uncomfortable situations .
The Jets ' middle linebacker Dwayne Gordon was active in the role he inherited from the injured Marvin Jones .
He led all tacklers in the half with a total of six tackles , including five unassisted .
...
Nick Gallery , competing with Brian Hansen , handled all the punts .
Gallery 's first went 49 yards and his second 55 .
...
Scott Frost , the quarterback for Nebraska , last year 's co-national champion , returned his first kickoff in a game and gained 19 yards .
...
There will be only an afternoon practice on Saturday and Sunday at the Jets ' training camp in Hempstead , N.Y . , starting at 2 p.m.
