MORALES BLOWS SMOKE ON CHILD HEALTH FUNDS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By CLAY ROBISON c.1998 Houston Chronicle
AUSTIN , Texas _ Attorney General Dan Morales , champion of sound bites and hyperbole , has polished his art on several occasions during the prolonged dispute over legal fees in the tobacco case .
But he outdid even himself last week when he asked a federal judge to slap $ 25 million in `` bad faith '' penalties on Gov. George W. Bush and seven legislators who have been fighting to lower the $ 2.3 billion awarded outside lawyers for representing the state .
Morales , on one side , and the governor and lawmakers on the other , have different opinions of how _ or whether _ the dispute over lawyers ' fees will affect Texas ' deal to collect $ 15.3 billion from cigarette makers .
I don n't know who is right , and I don n't think any of the principals in the debate can be sure either until the dispute is ended , either by the courts or a negotiated agreement .
But Morales has persisted in misrepresenting one important point , and that is that if the controversy were resolved today , tobacco dollars would start flowing immediately to health-care programs for children .
`` Right now , there are thousands of children across this state who could have received much-needed medical care had this frivolous action not been pursued by the challengers , '' he said in a written statement .
Morales has made similar statements several times in recent months , but they are not true , thanks to an agreement Morales himself negotiated with key legislators a few weeks after the tobacco settlement was reached .
The Legislature , not the attorney general or anyone else , will decide how the tobacco funds are spent .
And even if the first tobacco payments were to be transferred from the escrow account , where they have been held during the legal fees dispute , into the state treasury tomorrow , they would remain unspent until lawmakers appropriate them _ sometime after they convene in January .
Morales is now trying to negotiate an additional $ 2 billion from tobacco companies to allow Texas to match , proportionately , a tobacco agreement more recently hammered out by Minnesota .
But the tobacco settlement Morales struck early this year calls for cigarette makers to pay Texas $ 15.3 billion over the next 25 years .
At the outset , Morales agreed that the Legislature would decide how to spend the payments received after the first year , but initially the attorney general tried to specify how the $ 1.2 billion due the state the first year would be spent .
Morales picked a good cause _ health care , which has been traditionally underfunded in Texas .
He announced the cigarette makers ' first-year payments would be spent on a health insurance program for children , an anti-smoking campaign at the Texas Department of Health , programs at several medical schools and a new private foundation specializing in children 's health care .
But after state Sen. Bill Ratliff , R-Mount Pleasant , and state Rep. Rob Junell , D-San Angelo , the Legislature 's chief budget writers , went to court complaining that the attorney general was trying to usurp the Legislature 's budget-setting authority , Morales gave in and cut a deal with the lawmakers .
Morales signed a written agreement to let the Legislature , during its 1999 session , determine how the first-year tobacco payments are spent .
Ratliff and Junell promised , in return , to do their best to convince lawmakers to fund most of Morales ' priorities .
They nixed the private foundation but agreed to sponsor an effort to spend all the money on health care .
The two key lawmakers _ who weren n't in the group targeted by Morales for sanctions last week _ agreed to give special attention to a new Children 's Health Insurance Program , a top Morales priority .
This new federal program was created after the last session of the Legislature ended last spring and wasn n't funded by lawmakers in the current state budget .
Several million dollars have been found elsewhere in the budget to begin funding the program , although nowhere near the level envisioned by Morales .
Morales ' agreement with Ratliff and Junell provides that tobacco funds eventually will be used to pay back any money transferred into the health insurance program from the existing state budget .
The agreement doesn n't allow tobacco dollars to be spent on the program before the full Legislature approves the expenditure , Ratliff said .
`` I see no way that ( tobacco ) money could be used prior to being appropriated by the Legislature , '' the senator added .
There also are policy considerations involved in establishing the new children 's insurance program that should be resolved by the full Legislature anyway , Ratliff believes , reflecting , perhaps , a philosophical difference with Morales that goes beyond tobacco dollars .
Lawmakers won n't convene for another seven months .
Let us hope the dispute over the lawyers ' fees and a controversy over sharing tobacco payments with counties _ which also is holding up the settlement _ are resolved well before then .
