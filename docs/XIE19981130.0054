Israel , PNA to Talk on Third Stage Redeployment
JERUSALEM , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will start talks soon to define the scope of the Israel 's third stage troop redeployment in the West Bank , Israeli Foreign Ministry said here on Monday .
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has assigned a ministry official , along with a low-ranking officer from the Israel Defense Force , to talk this matter with the Palestinians in the near future , said the ministry .
The ministry did not say how many percent of the West Bank will be handed over to the Palestinians during the third stage pullback , but Sharon said in the past that it will only be 1 percent .
It is learned that senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Palestinian Preventive Security Chief in Gaza Mohammed Dahlan will head the Palestinian delegation to the talks .
Defining Israel 's third stage troop redeployment in the West Bank is part of implementing the Wye peace accord signed last month in Washington .
The accord stipulates that a Third Further Redeployment Committee starts its work soon after the accord entering in force on November 2.
Israel Radio said Monday that the United States will not join the two sides to discuss this matter but let them finalize it by themselves .
the Palestinian side insisted that under the Oslo Accords , the third stage redeployment should be 30 percent , not 1 percent as Israel stated .
