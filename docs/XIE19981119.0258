Indonesian Legislators Vow to Cut Military 's Seats
JAKARTA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesian legislators vowed to fight to reduce the number of unelected seats allocated to the country 's armed forces in the House of Representatives , national newspapers reported Thursday .
Under the terms of a government-sponsored draft law on general elections , the military will be allocated 55 of the 550 seats in the house on an unelected basis .
The house at present has 500 members , of whom 425 were elected in the 1997 general election and 75 represent the military .
Ruling Golkar 's Abu Hasan Sazili said his faction would offer the armed forces 25 seats while Zarkasih Nur from the minority United Development Party ( PPP ) faction said 15 would be sufficient .
The Muslim-based PPP was the only faction that opposed the allocation of unelected seats to the military in last week 's special session of the People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) .
It argued that only elected representatives of the people should be allowed to sit in the house .
However , it failed in its bid to have the military expelled from the country 's legislature , losing a vote on the matter in which the four other factions in the MPR supported a continued military involvement in politics .
Both Sazili and Zarkasih are members of the 83-strong House Special Committee set up to deliberate on political bills , which cover general elections , the structure and function of the House of Representatives , the provincial legislatures and the MPR , and political parties .
The legislators will have 27 working days to complete their deliberations and the bills are expected to be passed on January 28 , according to Sazili , who chairs the special committee .
A government-sponsored bill on the structure and function of the country 's legislatures entitles the armed forces to 55 unelected seats in a proposed 550-seat House of Representatives .
The military would also receive the same number of seats in a scaled-down MPR with 700 seats .
The MPR currently has 1,000 seats .
On the bill on general elections , both Zarkasih and Sazili said their factions would propose that foreign observers be allowed to monitor the general election to be held in May or June next year .
