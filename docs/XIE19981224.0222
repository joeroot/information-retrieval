English League Agrees Pay-per-View Deal
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The English Football League is to conduct a pay-per-view television experiment in the New Year .
The League has reached agreement with Sky Sports for six or seven games to be screened on a pay-per-view basis between Jan uary 1 and the end of the season .
" These are additional matches the Sky Sports viewers will have the option of buying should they wish to do so .
There 's no obligation , " said League spokesman Chris Hull .
" But this is an opportunity for us to gather information and research into the pay-per-view concept .
This is not a money-making exercise . "
Details of the matches chosen for the experiment will be announced in about two weeks , but the League plans to target fixtures which are likely to attract a sell-out crowd , leaving many fans unable to get in to see them live .
Two games believed to have already been pencilled in are Oxford vs Sunderland on February 27 and Grimsby vs Wolves on March 27 .
" The main thing is that pay-per-view will be benficial to the Football League come the next round of TV deal negotiations , whenever they will be .
" We will be in possession of more details regarding pay-per-view which will form a significant part of broadcasting in the 21st century , " Hull added .
Sky Sports already shows around 60 Football League games per season as part of their normal subscription service .
