Iran Pessimistic About Future Oil Prices
TEHRAN , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Iran expressed pessimism about future oil prices before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) ministers gather in Vienna next week to explore ways to deal with oil price slump .
" With a decrease in oil production cost in industrial states , no increase can be forecast for oil prices on world markets in the future , except under unexpected situations like war or revolution , " a senior official has said .
Hojatollah Ghanimifard , a department director of the National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) made the remark at a quarterly meeting of the National Iranian Energy Committee , the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday .
Ghanimifard said the production cost of each barrel of crude oil has considerably dropped over the past two decades as a result of technological and scientific progress .
In certain Western industrial countries , the cost has decreased to about 4.5 U.S. dollars per barrel in recent years from 12 dollars per barrel in the 1970s , he said .
The cost of oil production still continues to decline and therefore traditional oil producers can no longer expect to receive economic privilege , he noted .
He said that other factors like intervention of monetary institutions and certain international oil companies also have passive impacts on oil prices .
No considerable surge can be predicted for the oil prices in the near future as long as the economic crisis in Southeast Asia continues , Ghanimifard said .
Oil prices plunged again following the easing of tension between Iraq and the United Nations over arms inspections .
Oil experts believe that the OPEC ministerial meeting next week will not help in finding ways to recover the sluggish oil prices , as many of the OPEC members , including Iran , are against further cuts of output .
