Rates Rise Speculation Triggers Tumbling of Wall Street
NEW YORK , April 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Pummeled by broad-based selling , U.S. stocks finished sharply lower Monday as investors dumped shares , driven by fears that interest rates may rise .
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 146.98 points , or 1.62 percent , to close at 8 , 917.64 , recovering from a loss of about 224 points suffered earlier in the afternoon .
Losers outpaced gainers by 2,890 to 313 on a trading volume of 693 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange .
Other markets suffered heavy losses too , with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shedding 48.65 , or 2.60 percent , to 1 , 820.31 , its third-largest one-day point loss .
The broader S&AMP ; P 500 index lost 21.36 , or 1.93 percent , to 1 , 086.54 .
The stock market 's sell-off was triggered by heavy selling in bonds , caused by a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates .
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1.65 points in price , raising its yield to 6.06 percent -- its highest in almost two months .
