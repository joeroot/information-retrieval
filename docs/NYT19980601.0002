MEDALLIONS LOSE THEIR LUSTER AS CITY TIGHTENS RULES
( mk ) By ANDY NEWMAN c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ When Jack Lin heard his winning bid for a newly minted taxi medallion announced at City Hall last September , he felt a flush of love for his adopted country .
And why not ?
As the Taxi and Limousine Commission 's chairwoman , Diane McGrath-McKechnie , had stated , `` Aside from being a rock-solid investment for any potential small-business owner or entrepreneur , taxicab medallions are literally a piece of the American dream . ''
But Lin 's heavily financed $ 231,791 investment has been looking a little risky since Thursday , when the commission steeply increased insurance requirements and dropped the thresholds at which cabbies can lose their licenses .
With a requirement to set aside another $ 100,000 for accident victims and even lower suspension thresholds likely to be voted on this month , it could get riskier still .
`` The city said how good it is to buy the medallion , how it keeps its value , the price never goes down , '' said Lin , an immigrant from Hong Kong and a New York cabdriver for five years , speaking Sunday along a curb in the West Village .
`` But they don n't tell you the rules were going to change . ''
Of the tens of thousands of taxi and livery drivers and owners having to deal with the commission 's new safety regulations , the 5,000 owner-drivers of yellow cabs , who have neither bosses nor workers to cushion the impact of the changes , have been hit the hardest .
And no one is more bitter than the men and women who bought 400 new medallions at auctions in 1996 and 1997 _ except , perhaps , for more recent buyers who paid even more money , up to $ 250,000 each for pre-existing medallions , only to learn that prices have plunged as much as $ 50,000 since the new rules were announced .
The commission says that cabbies who own their medallions are the safest drivers because they have the most invested , both financially and emotionally , in their business .
But when they do get into accidents , they tend to leave their victims even more poorly compensated than the rest of the industry .
Big fleets , while they take great pains to hide their assets , will sometimes pay fair settlements under sufficient legal pressure .
But a cabby who has mortgaged everything he has to buy a medallion _ most of Lin 's $ 30,000 down payment , for example , was scraped up from friends and relatives , while the rest of the money was borrowed from a lender _ has nothing to offer .
`` It 's a dilemma , '' said Sandra Silverman , a taxi commissioner who voted for the new rules but whose reservations about the $ 100,000 bond forced Ms. McGrath-McKechnie to postpone the vote on it .
`` If you look at it objectively , if you have someone driving the public around in a car , there 's no reason why that car shouldn n't be insured at the highest possible level .
But the detailed and subjective reality is what does this do to all those people who are already in business and started operating under another standard , playing by the old rules ? ''
It costs them money , for one .
The new insurance minimums _ $ 100,000 in liability coverage rather than $ 25 , 000 , and $ 200,000 to cover medical bills rather than $ 100,000 _ are expected to increase owner-drivers ' premiums , now typically $ 3,100 a year , to $ 6,000 or more .
The new penalty schedule , which raises fines several hundred percent for infractions from smoking to speeding , can also cause a driver to lose his license after only two tickets .
But it is the requirement that every medallion owner set aside $ 100,000 in a bond _ which accident victims can collect if they get judgments in excess of insurance coverage _ that worries drivers the most .
`` I had trouble generating $ 40,000 to put down on my medallion , '' Johan Nijman , who bought his medallion in March for $ 240 , 000 , told the commission at its meeting on Thursday .
`` How in the world do you expect me to put up another $ 100,000 ?
I have six kids , two dogs and two cats . ''
Taxi industry leaders , who filed suit on Friday to overturn the new rules , have asked the commission to consider alternatives to the bond , like requiring owners to contribute to a pool of money to compensate people with the most devastating injuries .
But Ms. McGrath-McKechnie was unwavering .
`` I think the bond is going to pass as it is because it 's an excellent proposal , '' she said .
When asked whether independent owners whose medallions were already mortgaged to the hilt might find it impossible to come up with another $ 100 , 000 , Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said that many of them were financing their medallions by choice , not by necessity .
`` Some people may have assets in other places and they have chosen not to pay off the medallion or to put their assets elsewhere , '' she said .
Neil Greenbaum , a lender and broker who said he financed more than 100 of the new medallion purchases , scoffed at her assertion .
`` Maybe 10 percent of these guys have other assets , '' he said .
`` Maybe less .
Most of them came up through the ranks .
They drove , they bought their cars , then they bought their medallions .
Where would they be getting all this money from ? ''
Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said that in any case , a driver who stretched himself paper-thin to buy a medallion was not acting responsibly .
But Greenbaum noted that the commission , in promoting the medallion auction , held seminars for bankers to encourage them to lend money to medallion buyers .
`` In order to make your auction bid legal , '' Greenbaum said , `` you had to either have a bond or have 70 percent of your bid guaranteed by a lender .
It 's hard to believe they weren n't promoting the financing . ''
Greenbaum and other brokers are feeling the pinch of the new rules .
`` Up until a few weeks ago , I had a list of buyers and no sellers , '' said Ronald Chipman , a broker at Westway Medallion Sales .
`` Now I have a list of sellers but no buyers . ''
