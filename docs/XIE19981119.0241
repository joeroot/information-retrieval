British Submarine Tests Cruise Missile off U.S. Coast
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Britain 's attack submarine HMS Splendid successfully fired a Tomahawk cruise missile 800 kilometers at a target off the California coast on Wednesday in the first such live warhead test by Britain .
The British Embassy in Washington said two previous California tests using nonexplosive warheads were successfully conducted from the Splendid this month .
The Splendid , which launched the missile on Wednesday from one of its torpedo tubes while it was submerged , is the first British submarine equipped with the U.S . - made Tomahawk .
The satellite-guided six-meter missile popped out of the water and sped to the island , the British Embassy said in a statement .
The Tomahawk Land Attack Missile , or " TLAM " , can be fired from Navy cruisers , destroyers and submarines .
The missile 's range has been improved since the 1991 Gulf War from 1,120 to 1,600 kilometers and is now much more accurate with a satellite guidance system .
Britain also said that the success of this test is " a significant moment in the U.S.-U.K. global security partnership . "
" This new capability will enable the U.K .
to be an even more effective partner with the United States and NATO in support of international diplomacy , " the embassy quoted a British diplomat as saying .
