WASHINGTON -- Most Americans think the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives is motivated by a desire to embarrass the president rather than a search for the facts in its decision to release the videotape of President Bill Clinton 's grand jury testimony , according to a new poll .
In the CBS News poll , released Sunday , 59 percent said the committee voted to disseminate the tape Monday to embarrass and damage Clinton .
Another 35 percent said the tapes were being made public so others can judge whether Clinton committed perjury in statements about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky .
