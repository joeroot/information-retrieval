School Dropouts Increase in Zimbabwe
HARARE , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Zimbabwe 's economic hardships and some traditional practice are forcing thousands of children to drop out of schools , the Sunday Mail reported .
A spokesman of the Ministry of Education , Sports and Culture said in an interview with the newspaper that the high costs of education which have been worsened by the economic structural adjustment program are forcing both male and female children to drop out of schools at an alarming rate with girls being the worst affected .
According to a recent analysis by the U.S. Children and Education Fund , the attrition rate in transition from primary to secondary school for girls rose from 21 percent in 1985 to 33.5 percent in 1998 whereas that of boys rose from 16.12 percent to 26.1 percent in the same period .
United Nations Children 's Fund said the major causes of girl-child lower participation and achievement rates include socio-cultural influence on parents ' preferences for the education of males over girls , home work demands on girls , early marriages and unhospitable school environments for the girl-child .
Most parents interviewed by the newspaper said economic hardships have led to lack of financial resources to send their children to secondary school .
Sexual harassment and abuse of female pupils and students in Zimbabwean school institutions are the problems , among others , causing the dropouts , the Ministry of Education , Sports and Culture said .
