German Central Bank Leaves Key Financial Rates Unchanged
BONN , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The Bundesbank , Germany 's central bank , decided Thursday to keep its three key rates unchanged , maintaining the same level as the past two and a half years .
The discount rate , currently 2.5 percent , and Lombard rate , at 4.5 percent , were last changed in April 1996 , while the rate of security repurchase offer has been kept unchanged at 3.3 percent since October 1997 .
Frankfurt 's financial sector is not expecting any rate changes before the launching of the European single currency , or euro , on January 1 , despite calls from new Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine for a rate relaxation .
