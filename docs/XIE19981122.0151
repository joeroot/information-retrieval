China to Issue Corporate Bonds for Infrastructure Construction
BEIJING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Ministry of Railways ( MOR ) and a group of enterprises will soon be approved to issue corporate bonds to finance the country 's infrastructure construction spree , today 's China Daily reported .
Companies on the candidate list include central and regional enterprises in such sectors as highway construction , urban sewage disposal and treatment and telecommunications , the paper quoted a government source as saying .
It said the quota of bond issue for MOR is 1.6 billion yuan ( 192 million US dollars ) , though the national quota is still not available .
" The quota will not be publicized to avoid an impact on the stock market , " the source was quoted as saying .
China launched a gigantic infrastructure building program earlier this year to stimulate its economic growth .
Officials have said that the main funding sources for the program include September 's 100 billion yuan treasury bond issue , bank loans and enterprises ' own reserves .
China 's corporate bond issuers must obtain official approval before going ahead .
Financial authorities usually examine applicants once a year and applicants from different industries are examined together .
This year , the authorities singled out infrastructure projects for examination first to enable qualified firms in this sector to get the funds as soon as possible , said the English newspaper .
It said that the Three Gorges Dam , the world 's largest water conservancy and hydropower project , is also on the candidate list .
The project , which first tried a corporate bond issue last year with a one billion yuan offer , has a quota of two billion yuan this time , said the newspaper .
