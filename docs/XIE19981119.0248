ESCAP Urges More Attention to Waterways
BANGKOK , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The increased use of inland waterways for transport could reduce costs considerably and have important implications for socioeconomic progress in the Asia-Pacific region , a U.N. agency said .
Adrianus Mooy , executive secretary of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) said in a press release available here Thursday that in recent times , inland water transport has been somewhat neglected compared to other modes of transport such as roads and railways which have received higher levels of investment .
" In addition to the large capacity and lower investment requirements , inland water transport is the least costly , most environmentally friendly and energy-efficient form of transport , " Mooy was quoted as saying Wednesday at the first session of the Committee on Transport , Communications , Tourism and Infrastructure Development , organized by ESCAP between November 18 to 20 .
The committee will review implementation of the New Delhi Action Plan on Infrastructure Development in Asia and the Pacific and discuss issues related to development of inland water and maritime transport as well as sustainable tourism in the region .
In his opening address to the committee Wednesday , Suthep Thaugsuban , Thailand 's minister of transport and communications , said the strengthening of intraregional and interregional transport linkages has a crucial role to play in facilitating trade and tourism .
He said work undertaken by the ESCAP Secretariat within the framework of the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development ( ALTID ) project will have important implications for the region which strives to become more integrated with the globalization process .
High-level government officials from more than 20 countries of the ESCAP region and representatives from other U.N. bodies and specialized agencies as well as from intergovernmental organizations and NGOs are participating in the meeting .
