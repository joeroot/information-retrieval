& HT ; Wall Street : Market technicians win on strength of analysis & HT ; By Tom Walker & HT ; c.

ATLANTA _ Score one for the technicians .
These are the stock market wizards who practice technical analysis , an approach based on the idea that supply and demand explain the price movements of a stock or the entire market .
Technicians look at factors that can be quantified , such as volume , the number of new highs and new lows , price-to-earnings ratios , 200-day moving averages and a host of others .
Dan Sullivan , who writes one of the better Wall Street market letters , had this astonishing sentence in a recent edition of The Chartist newsletter : `` It 's not important to know what business ( a ) company is in . ''
In fact , he suggested , it might be better not to know , since an investor might get emotionally involved with the company and do something stupid .
The other school of thought is fundamental analysis .
It looks at the relationship between investment markets and such factors as management changes at a company , new products , economic growth rates , inflation and political events .
The idea is political , social and other events influence the way people behave , and one form of behavior is investing in stocks _ or bonds , or real estate or art .
Fundamentalists have been saying for some time that dismal profit growth this year would cause people to pull back from the market : Those in the market would sell some of their holdings to raise cash ; those not in it would park their money in cash or bonds until the right moment arrives for stocks .
And sure enough , the Commerce Department reported last week corporate profits declined 2.2 percent in the first quarter after falling 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 .
It was the first instance of back-to-back profit declines since the 1990 - 92 recession .
It reinforces the forecast that profit growth will be disappointing this year _ certainly less than it has been for most of the 1990s .
But you 'd never know profits are down by looking at the stock market .
The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 are up just about 12.5 percent so far this year , and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite is up just over 13 percent .
If disappointing profit growth is such a bad thing , wouldn n't the market be expected to rise more slowly , or even decline ?
Not if billions and billions of dollars continue to flood into stocks from investors buying mutual funds or stashing retirement funds away in 401 ( k ) plans .
Fund flow is a technical , not a fundamental , factor and does a good job of explaining the market 's rise this year .
The $ 26.6 billion investors put into stock funds in April brought total mutual fund assets of all types to more than $ 5 trillion _ that 's trillion with a `` t '' _ for the first time .
Yes , fundamentalists will say , people put money in mutual funds , but they did because the economy is growing , inflation is down , yada , yada , yada .
That doesn n't matter , say the technicians .
What counts is it was the flow of money into the market that pushed stocks higher , not the shrewd , brain-teasing analysis of corporate decisions , GDP growth , Asian flu or anything else .
It 's an endless argument .
Are technical and fundamental analysis as far apart as this scenario suggests ?
Of course not .
Technicians will tell you they look at fundamental factors , and fundamentalists look at lots of technical factors .
The market is too complicated to be explained by any one theory alone .
