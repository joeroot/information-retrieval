Frontier Town Becomes Trade Center on Sino-Russian Border ( 1 )
Harbin , November 19 ( Xinhua ) - With the improvement of Sino - Russian relations , the city of Shuifenhe in northeast China 's Heilongjiang Province has evolved from a frontier outpost in a remote region into a bustling border trade center .
This small city of 42,000 permanent residents is now home to more than 50,000 migrant retailers .
Despite the cold weather , the markets are full of goods and people and outside of stores , bargaining over prices and exchanges rates of yuan and rubles can be heard .
At the railway station , Russian and Chinese businessmen with packs and bags crowd together , waiting for trains to cross the Sino-Russian border .
In the evening , the city is brightly lit and on the major streets dancing bars with names like " Night Paris " entertain customers till early morning .
In 1997 , a total of 6-billion-yuan worth of vegetables , meat , shoes and socks , and other daily necessities were sold from local Shuifenhe markets to Russia , said Guo Xiaohua , secretary of the City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party .
" Our city appeals not only to Russian businessmen from the region around Fuladiswosituke , but also to those from as far away as Moscow , " Guo said , adding " it has become the largest market at the Sino-Russian border . "
Shuifenhe was established in the early part of the century when a trans-border railroad was built .
