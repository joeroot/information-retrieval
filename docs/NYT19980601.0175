BELFOUR CURSED BY ` BAD LUCK '
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By JENNIFER FLOYD c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
DETROIT _ Martin Lapointe glided into a vacated Dallas Stars zone , behind a vacated Stars net where he passed Stars goalie Ed Belfour , who had ventured from his crease to play the puck .
This much we know .
This much they agree on .
From there , Lapointe either slashed Belfour 's leg ( Belfour 's version ) or Belfour took a dive ( Lapointe 's version ) .
`` Well I played the puck , and Lapointe two-handed me and got me between the pads , '' Belfour said .
`` Obviously , it hurt . ''
The Stars goalie went down either writhing in pain ( Belfour 's version ) or trying to draw a penalty ( Lapointe 's version ) .
`` He was trying to draw a penalty , obviously , '' Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman said .
The next point on which everybody agrees is that Belfour scrambled back to the crease .
Lapointe scrambled in front of the crease .
Lapointe got there faster , sliding a puck past Belfour 's pads .
It was Detroit 's fifth and final goal , and it was the one that sealed a 5 - 3 Red Wings victory in Game 3.
Referee Terry Gregson `` didn n't say anything , '' Belfour said .
`` He didn n't want to come near me .
He knew . ''
Said Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor : `` Maybe it was \Ra dive\S , but \RLapointe\S touched a goalie .
He has to call that . ''
Whatever `` it '' was , `` it '' only capped a night that had been what Belfour himself described as a horrible .
Belfour , who had stood on his head for 13 playoff games before last night , finally teetered in Game 3.
He allowed Detroit four unanswered goals to begin Game 3.
He allowed the biggest after the Stars had battled back to pull within 4 - 3 in Game 3.
`` Again , it wasn n't my night , '' Belfour said .
`` I had some bad luck goals , unfortunately , far too many in one game . ''
The first goal began with an odd-man rush , and ended when Red Wings winger Brent Gilchrist whistled a shot high and over his shoulder .
The second goal by defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom looked to be heading wide , only to hit Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher 's skate and deflect in .
`` I had three of them that went off sticks or skates , '' Belfour said .
`` Hopefully , we got rid of all of them in one game . ''
The third goal slid between his pads , another slap shot by Lidstrom that hit something or someone before flying by Belfour .
The fourth goal sailed over Belfour 's shoulder , this time by Red Wings defenseman Jamie Macoun .
The fifth goal slid past him on the left .
`` That wasn n't one of Eddie 's best nights , '' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock admitted .
`` He 's carried us since the Olympic break , and I 'm not going to sit here and criticize anything Eddie Belfour does . ''
Said Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner : `` We can n't expect Eddie to stand on his head every night .
He played solid for us , and we didn n't for him . ''
Belfour entered Game 3 with a 1.41 goals-against average , the best among playoff goalies .
He had repeatedly kept the Stars in games that they had little reason to be in .
He had been Stars ' best player .
He , by his own admission , wasn n't even close last night .
Detroit had entered Game 3 preaching a steady diet of shots , traffic and head games for Belfour .
They tested him early as the Stars , pressing on the offensive end gave up one odd-man rush , then another and another .
`` We gave up a few odd-man rushes , and obviously at that point , we needed to make a few saves , '' Hitchcock said .
The saves just weren n't there , the goals from Lidstrom and Gilchrist coming in the first period .
The second-period goals by Lidstrom and Macoun came 1 : 20 apart .
The final goal against Belfour was the biggest and hurt the most .
On that , both Lapointe and Belfour can agree .
