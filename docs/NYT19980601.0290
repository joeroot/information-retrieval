HURRICANE WATCH IS ON FOR THE SUMMER
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By LARRY D. HATFIELD c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
SAN FRANCISCO _ The retreat of El Nino should mean a calmer overall hurricane season for Hawaii and the tropical Pacific , but storm watchers warn the early part of the season could see a repeat of last summer 's violent tropical storms .
Monday marked the beginning of the 1998 hurricane season in the central Pacific .
Hurricane season runs through Nov. 15 in the eastern Pacific and through October in the central Pacific .
Many scientists say the 1997 - 98 El Nino , an oceanwide warming of the Pacific 's surface temperatures , is waning .
Nevertheless , this El Nino , one of the biggest ever recorded , may still cause storm trouble .
The federal Climate Prediction Center forecasts above-normal water temperatures in the equatorial eastern Pacific through midsummer before approaching normal conditions by early fall .
`` Based on this forecast , there may be a tendency to have an increase in the number of tropical cyclones during the early part of the hurricane season , '' said Jim Weyman , director of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center .
But he admits there is no certainty .
`` The formation , growth , movement and dissipation of tropical cyclones are governed by many complex factors , only one of which is warm ocean water , '' Weyman said .
During last summer 's hurricane season , when El Nino was developing , there were nine major tropical storm systems in the central Pacific , twice the 36-year average and the fourth highest number of tropical storms during that period .
While full-blown hurricanes are rare in Hawaii _ there have been only four this century _ they are devastating when they do hit .
On Sept. 11 , 1992 , Hurricane Iniki caused $ 1.8 billion in losses on Kauai .
`` Regardless of the number of hurricanes and tropical storms that may occur , every citizen of Hawaii should prepare for a hurricane or tropical storm because it only takes one to cause extreme devastation , '' Weyman told a briefing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa last week .
Hurricanes are more common in the eastern Pacific , with the ocean west of Mexico acting as a breeding ground for the big storms .
In a typical year , 16 or 17 tropical storms and nine hurricanes form off the west coast of Mexico , some of them moving ashore with disastrous results .
The record-breaking storm season for the eastern Pacific was a non-El Nino year , 1992 , when 27 tropical cyclones rampaged around the ocean .
Unlike the hit-and-run Iniki , some hurricanes can hang around for a long time .
A 1994 storm named John formed off Mexico on Aug. 11 , traveled more than 4,000 miles over 31 days and reached peak winds of 170 mph .
Because John crossed the international dateline twice during its raucous journey , it changed status from hurricane to typhoon and back to hurricane .
In the Atlantic and eastern Pacific east of the dateline , storms attaining sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are hurricanes ; the same tropical cyclone west of the international dateline is called a typhoon .
A tropical depression , which is far more common than its bigger and nastier cousins , is an organized cluster of thunderstorms with sustained winds below 38 mph ; a tropical storm is more organized , with winds between 39 and 73 mph .
