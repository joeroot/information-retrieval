Hariri Refuses to Stay as Lebanon 's PM
BEIRUT , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Outgoing Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has refused an offer by the newly-elected President Emile Lahoud to remain as the country 's prime minister , said a presidential palace statement on Monday .
" The president has accepted Hariri 's refusal to head the new government and is expected to restart consultations to choose a new premier from Tuesday , " said the statement .
It added that Lahoud , a former army commander who was sworn in last week , invited Hariri on Friday to remain in his post but he refused .
Sources close to Hariri said he turned down the offer because the results of the consultations were considered to breach the constitution .
Under Lebanon 's law , the president designates a prime minister after formally briefing parliament speakers on the outcome of binding consultations with members of parliament ( MP ) .
However , last week 's consultations between Lahoud and members of the 128-seat legislature produced a three-way split with 83 in favor of Hariri 's reappointment , a handful against his return to power and 31 MPs authorizing the president to choose on their behalf .
And the MPs ' authorization for the president to choose the premier violated the constitution , said the sources .
Others say that Hariri 's lack of enthusiasm to return had more to do with trying to gain more control over the new cabinet than with constitutional considerations .
Under former president Elias Hrawi 's mandate , the billionaire prime minister , who first assumed the post in 1992 , had virtually had a free hand in running the country .
