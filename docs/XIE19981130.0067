Camels May Hold Secrets to River Blindness Cure
MUSCAT , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Omani researchers believe that the immune system of camels may hold the key to the treatment of river blindness , a major scourge afflicting millions of people in the third world .
Immunological studies underway at the Suhan Qaboos University suggest that a camel is endowed with a unique immune system , which protects it from many pests including one that is similar to the parasite that causes river blindness , Oman 's English Observer Newspaper reported Monday .
The associate professor of the university , Eugene Johnson , who leads the study , said that he and his teammates hope that their findings will eventually lead to the development of a vaccine against the parasite that causes river blindness .
Johnson said the research on camels ' immune system began two years ago when " we have found that camels become infected with a parasite very similar to the parasite that causes river blindness in human beings , but the camel has evolved very unique protective measures to destroy its parasite . "
" We are therefore studying how camels kill their parasites to gain insight into how we may stimulate the immune systems of humans to rid themselves of their parasites , " he said .
River blindness afflicts 35 to 40 million people around the world and is the second largest cause of infectious blindness .
It is endemic in parts of Africa , Latin America and Yemen .
