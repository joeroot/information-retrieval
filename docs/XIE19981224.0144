Chinese Farmers Doing Better after Moving from Dam Site ( 2 )
The municipal government plans to spend 200 million yuan over 3 years building 1,700 km of roads for these migrant people , and has paved 300 km of roads around which 2,000 of them live .
The new methods have been welcomed by these migrant people because they now have access to commerce and industry , according to Wang Xingyu , an official in charge of Chongqing 's relocation program .
But , what counts more is that the move benefits the environment of the region , which suffered from serious soil erosion , and it is now easier to get farmers to use more scientific methods instead of the the conventional farming methods that did a great deal of harm to the environment .
The municipal government plans to further tap Chongqing 's tourist resources .
Tourist resorts will be opened , where some 10,000 of these migrant people can get jobs .
