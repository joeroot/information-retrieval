JOHANNESBURG , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The demand for gold in global market in 1997 increased by nine percent as compared with the previous year to a record of 2,935 tons , a latest publication by the Geneva-based World Gold Council ( WGC ) said here Thursday .
Demand in the 21 key markets for gold consumption monitored by the WGC , 10 of which accounted for over 100 tons of gold demand in 1997 , reached record levels during 1997 , totaling 2,935 tons .
Of all the markets monitored , 13 showed continued growth , two flat and six seeing some contraction in demand .
The most significant developments in gold demand during 1997 and the fourth quarter of the year in particular were India , the United States and China .
In India , the world 's largest gold-consuming country , gold demand in 1997 reached an all time high of 737 tons , an increase of 229 tons or 45 percent compared with 1996 .
China 's gold demand in 1997 reached 213.8 tons , up three percent compared with the previous year .
In the developing country markets , which covers India , China , Southeast Asia , South Korea , Gulf States , Turkey , Brazil and Mexico , annual demand for gold reached record levels in 1997 , totaling 2,129.2 tons , up 13 percent as compared with the previous record set in 1996 .
Demand in the Gulf States reached record levels in 1997 , up 21 percent to 142.2 tons and marked the third year of uninterrupted growth .
Annual 1997 gold demand in Latin America ( Brazil and Mexico ) reached the highest levels in over 10 years , up seven percent compared with 1996 to 107 tons .
Statistics showed that in the developing markets , demand for gold over the past 10 years has almost doubled , increasing from 1,088 tons in 1988 to 2,129 tons in 1997 .
The fastest growth has been seen in India and the Middle East , where aggregate demand has increased four fold over the period .
However , the WGC said , the Southeast Asia region 's demand for gold last year was down 26 percent from the record levels of 1996 .
This largely reflects the adverse impact of the Asian financial and currency crisis which manifested itself in July in Thailand and subsequently widened to include Indonesia , Malaysia , Korea and , to a lesser extent , Singapore by the final quarter , WGC said .
In developed country markets , which covers Europe , the U.S. and Japan , aggregate demand in 1997 totaled 806.3 tons , one percent up compared with 1996 .
In terms of gold demand in Japan , the developed country remained in the weak position .
In 1997 , its demand for gold fell 23 percent to 130.4 tons as its economy continued to struggle .
