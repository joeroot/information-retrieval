Hainan Farmers Enjoy Prosperity
HAIKOU , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The so-called " green passage " in Hainan , China 's southernmost island province , not only supplies fresh fruits and vegetables to other parts of China throughout the year , but also provides a good income for local farmers .
Hainan farmers enjoy good harvests throughout the year and ensure abundant market supplies of fruit and vegetable to parts of the country subject to harsh winter weather .
The integration of production and marketing have created favorable conditions greatly enhancing the prosperity of farmers .
For example , Yacheng Town in the province 's second largest city of Sanya has emerged as the largest production base in the province .
Struggling local farmers who eked out a meager living a short 10 years ago now grow vegetables but operate transport companies .
The annual per capita income of farmers has jumped to 3,000 yuan ( 375 U.S. dollars ) , up dramatically from less than 400 yuan only a decade ago .
The improved status of farmers has been attributed to their increased awareness of modern agriculture , including both processing and marketing techniques .
Hainan has established a marketing network linked to 14 cities and an information center under the Ministry of Agriculture .
Farmers currently market products to 47 cities in 28 provinces .
The province is gradually expanding its transportation and marketing network , and is increasing funding for road construction in counties and villages .
The provincial government allocated 800 million yuan between 1996 - 1997 to construct roads stretching 1,600 kilometers .
