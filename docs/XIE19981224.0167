NBA Star Kemp Delivers Good Cheer
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- NBA players have been able to catch up on many things during the lockout , and Cleveland Cavaliers forward Shawn Kemp has used his free time to distribute Christmas toys and shoes to children .
When he played " Santa Kemp " today for 500 children at two Cleveland-area community centers , Kemp discovered a perspective that was overlooked during his active years .
" During the season , I would have had this event finalized before training camp , " Kemp said .
" This year , I was working on it up until the last minute , which gave me time to think about it , put more time into it and gain more understanding of what it means to the kids . "
Kemp began the giveaway five years ago while playing with the Seattle SuperSonics , continuing it after coming to the Cleveland Cavaliers last season .
The lockout actually made him more determined to follow through on the project this year .
" I 'll do it until I can n't fit in the Santa suit , " Kemp said .
