His parents : `` Your turkey is dry , you didn n't take the family name and you 're five years older than him . ''
Your parents : `` He 's not your religion , he 's supporting an ex-wife and child and you make more money than he does . ''
And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting grandchildren one more time ...
To be sure , the line between amicability and all-out war can be thin where in-laws are concerned .
With practice , though , experts say , you can learn to get along ...
and the sooner the better .
Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list , says Marlene Watson , a couples-and-family therapist in Philadelphia .
`` Parents never stop being protective or wanting the best for their child , '' she says .
Typically , she explains , one partner may feel that an in-law is interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it .
Then , to make matters worse , the spouse feels he or she is being attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of parents .
`` Battle No. 1 is , ` Where 's your primary loyalty ? '' ' says Watson , who is also director of the couples-and-family therapy graduate program at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia .
`` Your primary allegiance needs to be with your partner , but you can n't exclude parents . ''
The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a united couple , Watson says .
Both partners need to set up boundaries and communicate them to the in-laws .
This could mean asking your mother not to call before 9 : 30 a.m. on weekends or telling your father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter .
It 's also important not to put down your spouse 's parent .
`` This makes the partner defensive and rally to the side of the parent , '' Watson says .
Instead , explain to your mate what the problem is and involve him or her in suggesting ways to resolve the conflict .
& UR ; COUPLES AT RISK : WHO ISN ' T?
& LR ; & QL ;
Few people sail into in-law relationships without some apprehension and discomfort at first .
`` The marriage is a transition for everyone , '' Watson says .
`` You 're bringing together two sets of rules , and each family feels its rules should be followed . ''
Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really important , says Michael Ascher , a psychologist and professor of psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine .
For instance , he says , while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws ' predinner-cocktail ritual , she can learn to accept that it isn n't tantamount to alcoholism .
Studies indicate that younger people have more problems relating to their in-laws than those over 35 .
`` Parents and in-laws play a more significant role with younger people , for whom conflicts about independence and autonomy still exist , '' Ascher notes .
In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the engagement .
Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about the impending separation .
There may be discomfort about acknowledging their child 's sexuality .
They may fear adverse changes in the family structure .
Or differences in the new son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or rejection of their own values .
Penny Bilofsky , a Cherry Hill , N.J . - based psychotherapist and co-author of `` Inlaws / Outlaws : How to Make Peace with His Family and Yours '' ( Villard Books , 1991 ) , encourages newlyweds to reassure their parents .
`` Heavy doses of ` I love you , I will always love you and I will always be your child ' go a long way toward easing a parent 's troubled heart , '' she writes .
Particularly if the bride is older than her husband , his mother may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role .
Or a new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son .
And don n't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems , Watson says .
`` Siblings can have as major an impact on the couple as parents , '' she says .
`` They may call to ask for money , become very protective or take a strong dislike to the in-law . ''
Before you meet your in-laws , have your fiance brief you about their likes , dislikes and sensitivities .
The added knowledge will reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask questions that engage their interest .
& UR ; POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS & LR ; & QL ;
+ Wedding planning .
If a couple pays for all the arrangements , they may have things exactly as they wish , Watson says .
If parents are financing the affair , though , the couple should be prepared to compromise .
+ Juggling families .
One newlywed says the biggest adjustment has been getting used to the visitation demands of her husband 's large , very close family .
`` I walked into this huge family who did everything together .
My family felt like I was always with my husband 's family for birthdays , Sunday dinners and holidays , '' she says .
As a result , she says , she had to deal with `` the insanity of having to be at both sets of parents ' homes for every holiday . ''
This year , the couple announced they were alternating : They would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family , and Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks .
`` The Fourth of July is up for grabs ! ''
she says with a laugh .
Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the same day , the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend his or her own family 's party .
+ Negotiating .
The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby names , especially early in the marriage .
Not only do you know your parents ' quirks , but any resulting anger and annoyance is more likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse , Ascher says .
Once you know your in-laws better , try to handle disagreements yourself without putting your spouse in the middle .
Find a tactful way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in .
Or state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and your husband .
+ Money .
Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about how the gift is used and how you 're living your life .
`` Don n't accept large gifts unless you 're willing to accept the negatives that may go with them , '' Ascher advises .
`` If you accept a house down payment , expect visits and interference .
Decide if it 's worth it . ''
+ Criticism .
If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about your spouse , your first priority is to your husband or wife .
A parent should be told that he or she doesn n't have to love your spouse , but must respect your choice .
Don n't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents , and don n't let your in-laws play you against your spouse .
+ Cold shoulder .
Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and activities , continue to include him or her in important events and discussions .
Maintain a separate relationship with your parents , too , such as having lunch sometimes , Watson recommends .
`` You may just have to give a parent time , '' she says .
`` Stay in there and have faith . ''
What if you plain don n't like one of your in-laws ?
`` Your best bet is to be patient , cordial and mannerly , '' according to Bilofsky .
`` You have a loved one in common .
Do it for him . ''
If all else fails , she adds , `` Remind yourself that your in-laws must have done something right _ look at the child they raised . ''
