( For use by clients of the New York Times News Service ) Cash-Poor Nonprofits Turning to High Tech By Ilana DeBare c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle The Mission District YMCA in San Francisco is clearly part of the cyber-savvy 1990s , with eight networked Pentium computers , several pagers and cell phones , access to a 24-hour tech-support line , and three Palm Pilots for its top managers .
The Oakland branch of the NAACP , meanwhile , seems to be stuck somewhere in the late 1980s , with one secondhand computer which doesn n't have e-mail and sometimes simply refuses to open files .
`` If there 's a fairy godmother or godfather out there who can help us with technology , please tell us , '' pleaded Velma Chavis , a volunteer and secretary for the Oakland group .
For years , most California nonprofits have had more in common with the Oakland NAACP than the Mission Y _ cash-strapped , relying on antiquated , donated computers and unsure whether or how to spend precious resources on technology .
But that is slowly changing .
`` People in nonprofits are becoming willing to ask the harder questions and do longer-range thinking about technology , '' said Daniel Ben-Horin , executive director of CompuMentor , a San Francisco group that helps nonprofits take advantage of computers .
`` We are on the cusp of a turnaround where in the next two or three years , we 'll see nonprofits up there using technology like everyone else , '' said Florence Green , executive director of the 1,800-member California Association of Nonprofits .
California 's 45,000 nonprofits , with combined revenues of $ 60 billion , include a wide range of groups _ everything from giant health care organizations like Kaiser Permanente to tiny neighborhood associations .
The state 's smaller nonprofits share many technology dilemmas with small for-profit businesses .
When cash flow barely covers the rent , how can anyone afford to invest in computers ?
But experts say small nonprofits also face their own unique set of technology challenges :
_ Foundations traditionally have been reluctant to fund general operating costs , including computers .
_ Standard software often doesn n't address the needs of nonprofits , such as keeping separate accounts for money that comes in from dozens of different funding sources .
_ Nonprofits tend to attract employees who have little technical background and sometimes may even be technophobes .
_ Nonprofits constantly must weigh technology spending against programs that literally can be a life-or-death matter for clients .
The Asian Women 's Shelter in San Francisco , for instance , has a fairly inefficient computer system .
Its four computers aren n't networked , so staff members carry data from one to another on floppy disks .
And when battered women call the shelter 's crisis line , employees take notes by hand in paper file folders .
Someone retypes that information each quarter into a database to produce reports for donors .
But officials _ who turn away about half the women seeking shelter because the facility only has 16 beds _ understandably don n't see computer upgrades as their top budget priority .
`` If you weigh creating a computer database against providing food , shelter and language services to our clients , our priority will be for basic needs , '' said Beckie Masaki , director of the Asian Women 's Shelter .
For many small nonprofits , the first question about technology is : Buy or beg ?
Many nonprofits initially entered the computer era by scrounging for donated secondhand computers and for volunteers to set them up .
The obvious advantage to such an approach is cost savings .
But that approach also has big drawbacks : The volunteer who sets up a database today may be gone in a month , when the program may crash or need updating .
As secondhand computers get older , there 's less software and support available for them .
And systems pieced together from diverse , incompatible parts don n't work very well .
`` Sometimes , a group will have a dentist on their board who says , ` I know a great programmer , '' ' said Jan Masaoka , executive director of the Support Center for Nonprofit Management in San Francisco .
`` The group hires him , since they don n't want to cross a board member .
But then it turns out the guy who 's a great programmer for dentists ' offices doesn n't know anything about nonprofits . ''
In response to such glitches , more nonprofits today are deciding to invest money in technology systematically .
Some groups are even starting to budget money for computer support and training _ an area that nonprofits traditionally have overlooked .
Ben-Horin of CompuMentor estimates that nonprofits spend just 5 percent of their technology budget on support and training , far less than the average of 30 percent at for-profit firms .
Employees are expected to just `` pick up '' the software skills they need .
And network support is commonly left to an untrained office manager , secretary or whoever shows the slightest interest .
`` You end up with far too many organizations that have the equipment they need but no capability of using it beyond the first or low-second gears , '' Ben-Horin said .
`` That means a tremendous productivity loss and tremendous frustration , with people sitting there every day staring at a computer that isn n't doing what they want . ''
Ben-Horin urges nonprofits to shift some of their limited computer budgets away from hardware and into tech support .
`` I 'm talking about an informed choice to stay , perhaps , a bit behind the cutting edge while reserving funds for planning , training and support , '' he said .
Some groups , like the San Francisco YMCA , are already making such informed choices .
The Y appointed a task force that spent a year developing a technology plan .
It ended up converting all its branches to PCs on a network , with a centralized tech-support department .
Other groups , like the Oakland NAACP , are just starting down the path of technology planning .
`` Right now , we 're debating whether we need to go out and invest in a new computer or wait ' till a fairy godmother comes by and says , ` Here 's a Pentium '' ' said Chavis .
`` We 're trying to get away from handouts because there comes a time when that doesn n't work anymore . ''
