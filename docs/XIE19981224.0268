Russia Satisfied with U.N. Resolutions on Cyprus
NICOSIA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Russian ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Mouradov Wednesday described two U.N. resolutions on Cyprus as satisfactory .
Mouradov expressed the hope that these resolutions , adopted Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council , will give a positive push to the settlement of the Cyprus issue .
The Russian ambassador was speaking after a meeting with Cyprus Under-Secretary to the President Pantelis Kouros with whom he exchanged views on the resolutions .
The first resolution extends the mandate of the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus for a further six-month period , until June next year .
It expresses grave concern with the " excessive levels of military forces and armaments " in Cyprus .
The second resolution urges Secretary-General Kofi Annan to pursue mediation efforts between the two communities and to secure a " staged process " of reduction of troops and armaments on Cyprus .
Mouradov said that Moscow " remains steadfast in its positions on all substantial issues for a settlement in Cyprus " .
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup .
Turkey now has a military force of more than 35,000 to protect the break-away Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey .
Asked where the Russian-made S-300 missiles ordered by Cyprus will be deployed , the ambassador said this issue was not discussed at his meeting with Kouros .
Nicosia government has said it would reconsider the deployment of the missiles if substantial talks for a Cyprus settlement begin or if negotiation for the reduction of arms and troops leading to demilitarization get underway .
