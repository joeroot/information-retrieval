So you 're scanning Monday 's results of the Top 10 movies at the box office this past weekend .

You 've probably heard of that .
Down past the Robert Redford movie , five , six ...
Six ?
`` I Got the Hook-Up '' ?
`` What is this new Hollywood assault on the English language ? ''
you ask .
A month ago it was `` He Got Game . ''
Now it 's `` I Got the Hook-Up '' ?
And who is this Master P _ the movie 's producer , writer and star ?
Well , if you were among those wondering about the movie and how it debuted at No. 6 nationally and No. XX in Atlanta _ obviously you 're in need of a `` hook-up '' ( meaning : a favor or special deal ) .
And here it is .
Your Master P primer :
-- Who is Master P : The entrepreneur who wrote , produced and stars in the comedy about illegal cellular phone service .
He 's also a rapper who will release his supposed final CD today , `` Da Last Don , '' so he can concentrate on other business ventures such as film and a clothing line .
-- The P stands for : Percy Miller .
-- Personal info : The 28-year-old was born in New Orleans .
He is single .
-- Professional background : He got into the music business as a retailer , opening a No Limit Records store with a $ 10,000 malpractice settlement his family received .
His 6-year-old No Limit Record label includes his brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder , TRU , Mia X , Mystikal , Fiend , Young Bleed , Sons of Funk and new signee Snoop Doggy Dogg .
It has sold more than $ 120 million in records .
Only Warner Bros. has more artists in pop music 's Top 40 .
-- You know that 's Master P on a record when : You hear his signature grunt ( `` unngghhh '' ) .
-- In comparison to the other P man : Master P is bigger than Puff Daddy right now .
When Master P wanted a label , he started one with his own money .
When he wanted to get into film and couldn n't find a distributor , he released the million-selling `` I 'm Bout It '' straight to video and retail outlets .
`` Whenever somebody told me I couldn n't do something because of where I 'm from , what color I am or whatever , I 've proven them wrong , '' he said .
