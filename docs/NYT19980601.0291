TAKE-BOS UNIVERSAL CITY , Calif. : ... `` finishing first . ''
That 's happening not only in California .
Last month , US Representative Jon Christensen , the favorite in Nebraska 's gubernatorial race , finished a distant third after a barrage of negative ads .
The reaction in Nebraska was ferocious , prompting several of the state 's leading Republicans , including US Senator Chuck Hagel and US Representative Doug Bereuter , to assail Christensen for his tactics .
`` A negative ad destroys the target and the sender , '' said GOP pollster Frank Luntz , who believes that voters will not accept `` multimillionaires who use their fortunes to destroy an opponent . ''

Party means almost nothing .
& LR ;
Party has never been as important in California as elsewhere .
In the early part of the centry , the California Progressives undercut parties by severely limiting their organizational capabilities , taking partisanship out of local government and even requiring parties to change their leaderships and their headquarters every other years .
As a result , parties , which never had the patronage base of parties that developed in Boston and Chicago , could not nurture their roots here .
By the 1950s , California had cross-filing , allowing a candidate to register on both sides of a primary .
This year the blanket primary , which forces Republicans and Democrats to run together on the same ballot in the same contest , is further undermining party identification .
`` The notion of party is weakened this spring , '' said James Fay , a founder of the Northern California Committee for Party Renewal .
`` We are essentially running two general elections , back-to-back .
It is good for the entrepreneurs who put out mass mailings but bad for people who care about the parties , which if nothing else has provided some sort of a ` cue ' for voters to recognize where candidates stand . ''
In the blanket primary , a Republican can vote for a Democratic gubernatorial nominee or vice-versa , sometimes for tactical reasons such as selecting a weak opponent for their rivals .
`` People who are not part of a party can help choose a nominee , '' said Sherman Lewis , a political scntist at California State University at Hayward .
`` Conservatives and progressives here should be worried that they have lost control over a choice that they used to have for themselves . ''

Hispanics mean almost everything .
& LR ;
Hispanics are a rapidly growing part of the US population , economy , culture , and political system .
The Census Bureau estimates that His-panics , the fastest-growing voting group , could become the largest minority group within seven years , surpassing African-Americans .
In the four years between Bill Clinton 's two presidential campaigns , Hispanics added 1.5 million people to the voting rolls .
In California , the Latino vote is twice as important now as it was at the beginning of the decade , and the Republicans ' share is down .
Ronald Reagan won 44 percent of the state 's Latino vote in 1984 .
Dole won less than 10 percent in 1996 .
`` Latinos have identified the Republican Party as being unwilling to recognize their presence and the changes they are bringing to the state , '' said Fernando Guerra , director of the nonpartisan Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University .
`` They believe Republicans are willing to mobilize white voters against them for short-term political gain . ''
Guerra and other analysts believe that Hispanics could account for one-fifth of the voters in Tuesday 's primary .
`` Not only are older Latinos turning out , but so are the newly naturalized Latinos , '' said Monica Lozano , associate publisher of the Spanish-language La Opinion newspaper .
`` They have sworn allegiance to this country , take citizenship seriously , they are highly motivated .
You can n't just define ` likely voters ' as the people who voted the last four times . ''
That 's why the major candidates advertised on Spanish-language television .
Indeed , one of the important moments of the campaign was a bilingual debate ( `` California Hacia El Futuro , '' or `` California into the Future '' ) carried live on Spanish-language stations in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Sacramento , Fresno , and Bakersfield .

Politics is increasingly a female game .
& LR ; Six years ago California elected two female US senators .
Twice , women have won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination .
Now the novelty of female candidates is gone .
`` There have been so many prominent women that one no longer has the sense that being a female brings out the female vote _ or antagonizes the male vote , '' said Sandra Powell , a political scientist at San Francisco State University .
But there still is a decided female factor .
Women have a growing presence in public offices nationwide , and many analysts believe Clinton won in 1992 and 1994 because of his support from women .
In California , political professionals estimate that the Democratic primary vote will be about 58 percent female .
Governor Pete Wilson won reelection four years ago against Kathleen Brown because he won many votes from moderate Republican and Democratic women .
`` You can n't win an election with a pro-male gender gap in this state , '' said Donna Lucas , who runs a political public relations firm in Sacramento .
`` The big question here is how to win over those moderate Republican and Democratic women . ''
& UR ; 7.
All politics is local .
& LR ;
Two big national issues _ bilingual education and campaign-finance reform _ are state issues in California , and the battles are more advanced on the state level than on the national level .
Californians address both issues in referendums on Tuesday 's ballot , in a demonstration of the appeal of bringing important choices straight to the voters .
`` The answer here may be to let each state , and even localities , determine what is best , '' said freshman GOP state Assemblyman Bill Campbell , who represents southeastern Orange County .
`` They are a better forum for these decisions because they are a lot closer to the people . ''
