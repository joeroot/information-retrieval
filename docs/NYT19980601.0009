SUBURBS REJECTING YESTERDAY 'S ANSWER TO TODAY 'S SPRAWL

SLOATSBURG , N.Y .
_ The law people cite most often in this village these days is the one that says precisely what kind of housing is allowed : single-family houses on lots of 40,000 square feet , single-family houses on 30,000 square feet , single-family houses on 15,000 square feet and single-family houses on 10,000 square feet .
Period .
The word `` apartment '' appears only to describe something that may exist on the second floor of a single-family house , and then only by permit .
Nowhere do the words `` big condominium town house project '' appear , and villagers have been crowding town meetings this spring to keep it that way .
They are trying to derail a plan by Mayor Samuel Abate to bring the first multifamily housing to a village filled with people who came here to get away from the very idea .
Sloatsburgers are willing to have change and growth _ to a point , said Becky Kern , a leader of the Little Town Forum for the Historic Preservation of Sloatsburg , a group formed to resist Abate .
`` We don n't want change that will bring us to a future of jammed roads , overcrowded schools , vinyl-clad boxes piled three and a half stories high and a shopping center that looks like every other strip mall , '' she said .
This view puts Mrs. Kern and her allies squarely in the mainstream of a national reaction against high-density row house developments like the one K. Hovnanian Enterprises , the biggest town house developer in the country , hopes to build in Sloatsburg .
It is an opposition that seems a far cry from an early acceptance of suburban town houses , when they first began appearing in large numbers in the 1970s , as sensible , affordable and _ because they reduced sprawl _ environmentally friendly starter homes for young couples , or as step-down homes for empty-nesters .
But as the number of town houses has increased , complaints have grown that town houses clog roads , send more children into local schools than had been promised , depress the value of single-family houses and too frequently become rental units .
Consider : The Supervisors of Prince William County , Md. , concerned about rapid growth , approved a zoning plan this spring that reduces the number of future town houses that may be built by 10,000 units , or 40 percent .
It did so by creating a zone excluding town houses in the county 's western reaches .
Prince George 's County has already passed a law banning town houses in certain areas where schools are overcrowded .
The supervisors were responding to widespread complaints that town houses were driving down property values and overcrowding schools .
Two years ago , Brian Sheerin won a seat on the town board in the suburban Pittsburgh town of Ben Avon on the strength of a last-minute write-in vote from neighbors opposed to a small , 15-unit town house project on Dickson Avenue .
And in an early example that could have come from nearly anywhere , the City Council of San Leandro , Calif. , rejected a 36-unit row-house project in the northern part of town in 1992 despite a consensus from environmentalists that by filling vacant space in a built-up area , the project was environmentally sensible .
`` I don n't care how it is designed , where it is located , what it costs and who is developing it , '' Bradley Inman , a real estate writer , said in a commentary for The San Francisco Examiner .
`` High-density housing almost always puts a scare into people who live in nearby single-family neighborhoods . ''
As in many many places , Sloatsburg residents opposed to town-house developments said that single-family projects would be fine .
Mrs. Kern pointed to a planned development of large houses in Tuxedo , the next village north along Highway 17 .
`` Why can n't we have that , and attract the same level of housing ? ''
Mrs. Kern said in an interview .
`` They would not have to be $ 350,000 houses _ $ 250,000 would be fine . ''
The reasons for the suburbs ' nearly universal resistance to town houses is not hard to find , said James Hughes , dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University .
Prosperity and aging boomers have brought a change in the housing ideal , away from the `` free and easy '' life promised by town-house advertising 20 years ago , to a more settled outlook .
`` The dominant force in residential land-use matters is the baby-boom generation , and to a large extent they have now settled into communities where they are in for the long haul , '' Hughes said .
`` That 's where they have decided to raise their children , that 's where they made that big investment , and they are not only intent on protecting their investment , they are also getting nostalgic , looking back at grandma 's house and grandma 's community of single-family houses in a small-town setting _ even if they themselves grew up in much tackier surroundings . ''
Merle Huseth , president of K. Hovnanian Northeast Inc. , said : `` With most towns , they just don n't want anything that may generate schoolchildren .
They won n't say that , but they 'll whisper it to you _ they don n't want any kind of density that may give you school-age children and they don n't want any kind of housing that will generate any more traffic . ''
More than 1,300 Sloatsburg residents , including 800 registered voters , signed a petition this spring opposing the mayor 's plan for a `` floating zone , '' which would allow the Mayor and the Village Trustees to change zoning over a broad reach of the village on their own , bypassing the Zoning Board of Appeals .
Five large areas could be thus rezoned for high-density housing , bringing in 700 to 800 new homes and 2,000 residents .
At one site , K. Hovnanian Enterprises has already filed plans for a 340-unit town house project _ on a tract that had been intended for 66 single-family houses _ and it is holding out a sweetener to the town : a sewage treatment plant that would handle both the new housing and most of the Route 17 business district .
And after 18 years in office , Abate has learned how to make things go his way .
Over fierce opposition , he merged the police forces of his village and the town of Ramapo and sold the village 's water supply system to a private water company .
When asked what would happen to Sloatsburg if he failed to get his way on the floating zone , Abate was polite but firm .
`` I don n't have any idea that it won n't happen , '' he replied .
`` We need a greater mix of housing so our young people will be able to stay in town , '' Abate said , noting that the village 's population had not budged since 1990 .
`` We need to expand our tax base , because costs keep rising and the demand for services keeps rising .
And we need that sewer treatment plant . ''
Sloatsburg 's single-family homes are cradled along the Route 17 corridor just north of the New Jersey line in Rockland County , and in little valleys and hillsides in the Ramapo Mountains , which form the village 's western wall .
A fair number of young families have moved there from New Jersey and Westchester to find inexpensive homes , average price still only $ 148 , 000 , in an atmosphere that has more of Vermont than a downstate New York commuter town , barely an hour from Manhattan on the Short Line bus .
But while its residential areas are fetchingly rustic , Sloatsburg 's main street , along Highway 17 , is a gap-toothed stretch of gas stations and shops , without a distinct downtown and lacking any of the Main Street charm other rural towns have striven to achieve .
Opponents of the town house project say mass development would only add to the downscale look of their town 's business stretch .

Mrs. Kern and her husband , Greg , bought their old , gabled Victorian fixer-upper seven years ago and now have two little girls .
Their home on Eagle Valley Road stands almost across from where the entrance to a potential floating zone development could descend .
`` I want growth _ I want development , '' Mrs. Kern said .
`` But not condos . ''
Her neighbor , Bill Berntsen , expressed the surprise many feel at being unable to stop a project that is manifestly unpopular .
`` Now you know your future is not your own , '' he said .
`` It 's in a developer 's office . ''
At a packed public meeting on May 18 , about 400 residents broke the maximum occupancy rules at the Senior Citizens Center to upbraid Abate and the three-member town board ( one had resigned , reportedly because of the pressure of the zoning issue ) .
One speaker supported the change : Frank Dailey , a developer who had been frustrated by the town before .
Every other speaker was opposed : Harrison Bush worried about sewer costs , Dan Simone said the local schools would be destroyed , Rich Gurasser said young people would be squeezed out of town and across the line into Orange County , and Pat Kleese worried about the fate of the bear that occasionally forages for garbage at the end of her road if the Hovnanian project were built up to her lot .
`` I can look out my window and see my neighbors , '' Ms. Kleese said , `` but I can n't see what they 're having for breakfast .
That 's the way I like it . ''
And there was a more subtle note of concern , a note about what kind of people might come , expressed by a speaker who asked whether or not social service agencies would be allowed to rent any of the new row houses for their clients .
Troy Osborne , 28 , a fifth-generation Sloatsburger , rents a home for himself and his wife from a friend in the Flats , in the old downtown section , while he builds his truck repair business .
But he rejected bate 's contention that young families like his need new housing .
`` The young people are finding places to live without this hange , '' Osborne said .
`` That 's why there is so much anger and aggression against this .
It 's like three or four people trying to determine the lives of 3,100 people . ''
