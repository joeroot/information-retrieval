DOW DROPS AGAIN AS INVESTORS FEAR SLOWING EARNINGS
( lh ) By EDWARD WYATT c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply again Friday , as continued fears about instability in Russia and economic weakness closer to home produced the worst week for the American stock market in nine years .
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 114.31 points , or 1.4 percent , to close at 8051.68 .
For the week , the Dow industrials were down 5.6 percent .
Not since the so-called `` mini-crash '' of October 1989 , when the Dow fell 7.8 percent , has the bellwether index fallen so far so fast .
The decline Friday was a mere shadow of the 4.1 percent drop on Thursday .
But a stream of global losses continued , with financial markets in Asia and Europe particularly hard hit .
In the course of the last week , American investors have begun shifting their attention away from Russia and other foreign economies to the weakening outlook for corporate profits at home .
Those concerns showed up Friday in the loss in the Nasdaq Composite index , which is chock-full of the computer and Internet stocks that are enormously popular with individual investors .
Traders aggressively sold shares of Dell Computer , Cisco Systems , Yahoo and Amazon.com , stocks that have been among the biggest gainers of the year .
The Nasdaq index fell 46.73 points , or 2.8 percent , to 1639.68 , and finished the week 8.8 percent lower .
Despite the recent losses , most investors in these technology stocks are sitting on enormous gains : Amazon.com , for example , is still up 251 percent this year .
Some investors , and a few analysts on Wall Street , are beginning to worry , though , that profits for these and other American companies might not grow as much as expected next year .
`` The problem is not just in Asia anymore , '' said James Paulsen , chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis .
`` Look to the north and south , '' where the Canadian and Mexican economies are struggling .
That could more directly affect the profits of American companies , he said , keeping profit growth below 5 percent annually for the next few years .
In the last few years , investors have come to expect growth of 10 percent or more .
Others are even less optimistic .
`` We see no real earnings growth in 1998 or 1999 , and we 're uncertain about the year 2000 , '' said Peter Anderson , chief investment officer at American Express Financial Advisors .
With that outlook , it is hard to justify current market prices , much less the far higher valuations of just a few weeks ' ago .
Since closing at a record high on July 17 , the Dow industrials have lost 13.8 percent of their value , exceeding the 13.3 percent decline from August through October of last year .
The major stock indexes are still showing gains for the year _ the Dow is up 1.8 percent , and the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 index is up 5.9 percent .
But individuals who invest through mutual funds are more likely to be in the red .
According to Lipper Analytical Services , the average general stock fund was down 2.8 percent from the beginning of the year through Thursday , meaning the recent plunge has started to eat into the profits accumulated over the last three roaring years .
The stock market attempted to rally Friday .
In the first half hour of trading , the Dow industrials jumped more than 78 points .
But in 15 minutes , they lost all that and more , as sell orders flooded in .
The rest of the day , virtually any rally in share prices was met with further bouts of heavy selling .
Some market analysts continue to be optimistic , chief among them Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs & AMP ; Co. In a note to clients Friday , Ms. Cohen said that the recent declines in equity prices `` have been more closely linked to changes in sentiment than changes in the fundamental backdrop in the United States . ''
She added that the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 index , which fell 5 percent last week and is 13.4 percent below its high , `` is now 7 percent to 10 percent undervalued . ''

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
She now favors technology and financial services stocks , which suffered sharp blows again Friday .
Information is beginning to dribble out about the exposure of banks and securities firms to losses in foreign markets from loans , securities trades and complex financial contracts known as derivatives .
BankAmerica Corp. and BankBoston Corp. each reported heavy losses from the trading of domestic and international assets .
BankAmerica said it has lost $ 220 million this quarter , primarily because of Russia , leaving it with trading profits of $ 315 million for the year .
BankBoston said its international and domestic trading operations have lost $ 30 million in this quarter , with only one-third of the loss related to Russia .
Having focused on Russia losses until now , investors in financial stocks began to fret more about losses in other locales , including Latin America .
Worries about the Russian economy , and its possible ripple effects through much of the developing world , continued to weigh on foreign markets Friday .
Share prices fell more than 2 percent in Britain and 1.7 percent in Germany , while Japan 's Nikkei index slid 3.5 percent and finished the day below 14 , 000 , at its lowest level in 12 years .
But Latin American markets , which have been swamped by selling in recent weeks , took a breather .
Mexico 's major stock market index gained 3.2 percent , and Brazil 's rose nearly 2 percent _ small gains , but important for markets that have lost more than one-third of their value since January .
Investors worldwide generally sought safety , and in the United States they snapped up shares of electric utilities , telecommunications companies and others that pay high , steady dividends .
Shares of Consolidated Edison , for example , rose 1 3 / 16 , to 47 13 / 16 , their highest level in a year , as the Dow Jones utilities average rose nearly 1 percent .
The utilities index , in fact , has gained 3.9 percent since the beginning of January , more than twice the gain in the Dow industrials .
Stocks of regional telephone companies also rose Friday , with Ameritech , Bellsouth and Bell Atlantic among the winners .
Bell Atlantic gained 2 to 45 3 / 16 .
The biggest losses were among the technology stocks that have a fervent following of individual investors .
Dell Computer fell 6 5 / 16 to 118.75 , while Cisco Systems dropped 4 7 / 16 to 94 11 / 16 ; meanwhile Amazon.com dropped 13 7 / 64 to 105 57 / 64 and Yahoo dropped 8 to 83 1 / 16 .
Investors who have held those stocks for the year may be wincing at the latest declines but reminding themselves of their nice gains earlier this year .
And in general , the market 's drop in recent weeks is still not considered severe by many Americans .
`` We 're not yet even back to where we started the year , '' said Paulsen of Norwest about the latest decline .
`` People are saying ` Oh , isn n't that interesting . ' If we got down another 15 percent , to where their net worths were back to where they were in 1996 , they may begin to worry . ''
