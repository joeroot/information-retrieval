Former Zambian President Criticizes Government
LUSAKA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda criticized the government policies in the country 's Northern Province on Sunday , saying that his United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) will use the local government elections as a launch pad for the second liberation of Zambia .
Addressing a rally in Chinsali of the province , Kaunda said he can not sit by and let Zambia go to ruins because of misguided leadership , The Post reported Monday .
The local newspaper quoted him as saying that the second liberation is aimed at freeing the country from poverty which has come as a result of economic stagnation .
" This government has no direction .
Education is now for the rich .
The young in Zambia have no future , " he said .
At another rally in the province he said he does not fear being arrested again for the second liberation of his country .
In Isoka of the province Kaunda said on Saturday that the struggle to wrestle power from the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy ( MMD ) will not be violent as the wind has already started blowing .
On Saturday , MMD leader , president Frederick Chiluba , called on Zambians to vote for MMD in the local government elections to be held on December 30 .
Chiluba appealed to his countrymen to give his government a little more time to improve their welfare as the rampant poverty in the country could not be solved overnight .
After his release last June Kaunda said he will retire from party politics .
Kaunda was arrested on December 25 of 1997 for alleged involvement in the coup attempt on October 28 of the same year .
