Iraq Agrees to Resume Cooperation With
BAGHDAD , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraq said on Saturday that it allows an unconditional return of U.N. weapons inspectors , a move that will possibly ward off an imminent U.S. military strike .
Iraq will allow the inspectors of both U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to return and resume their normal missions .
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan read on Iraqi TV , Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz expressed the hope that the resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors will be " a step towards " lifting sanctions against Iraq .
He said the previous Iraqi decisions to stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors were only aimed at seeking an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.N. sanctions .
Iraq announced two decisions in August and October to partially and totally stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors .
It demands the U.N. consider the lifting of the eight-year-old comprehensive sanctions on it .
Under U.N. resolutions , the sanctions can only be lifted after the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction .
Aziz said the decision to resume cooperation with the U.N. came when many security council members oppose a military solution to the current crisis and support Iraq 's view over the lifting of the sanctions .
Aziz gave special credit to Russian , Chinese and French diplomacy for the resumption of the cooperation .
Some diplomatic sources here said Saturday that , U.N. chief Kofi Annan , in a letter to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Friday , made a personal assurance of his efforts towards the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq .
Annan also called on Iraq in the letter to resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors before " it is too late . "
Aziz stressed that Iraq has agreed to resume the cooperation not in fear of the " aggressive campaign " by the United States .
The U.S. has threatened a military attack to force an Iraqi backdown and is busy with building up military power in the Gulf .
Washington is sending in B-52 and B-1 bombers along with F-117 stealth jets .
This will bring U.S. forces poised near Iraq to more than 20,000 armymen , 300 aircraft and 20 ships , including two aircraft carriers .
