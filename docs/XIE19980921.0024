PNA Official Criticizes Ladani 's Release
JERUSALEM , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- A senior Palestinian official strongly criticized on Sunday an Israeli court 's decision to release Avshalom Ladani suspected of shooting and killing a Palestinian youth on Thursday .
Ahmad Al-Tibi , advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Israeli affairs , told the Voice of Palestine that Ladani 's release shows Israel 's true intention of " granting the green light to these settlers to riot in Palestinian territories and to open fire at random against the Palestinian people . "
Ladani , a 35-year-old settler of Dolev Settlement in the West Bank , surrendered to Jerusalem police Thursday evening and admitted that he had opened fire toward Palestinian students near Ramallah the same day , in which a Palestinian student was killed .
He also told the police that other settlers in his car , which was stoned by the students , also opened fire toward the students and he was sure that one student was killed by his shooting .
The Jerusalem Magistrate Court decided Sunday to release Ladani and put him under " house arrest " in a Jerusalem hostel pending further charges till next Sunday .
Ladani was remanded by the court on Friday .
Jerusalem police said that the investigation is going on and the police has yet to determine if Ladani fired in self-defense .
The Palestinian side said that Israel was to blame for the shooting and demanded that Ladani be turned over to it to stand trial .
The killing incident triggered bloody clashes Friday between the Palestinians and Israeli security forces in Ramallah with many Palestinians calling for revenge .
