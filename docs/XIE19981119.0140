Bangladeshi FM on Foreign Policy
DHAKA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The present Bangladeshi government has consistently treated its foreign policy as a national policy , which is not confined to the outlook of a certain party , Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said here Thursday .
" We are working on a ( foreign ) policy which ...
reflects the hopes and aspirations of the entire nation , " Azad told a regular weekly briefing .
The main emphasis of the country 's foreign policy was on " how best relations can be built up with our neighbors , " he said .
He assured that the present government would honor all commitments with the outside world made by the previous regimes .
" We will honor all commitments and understanding reached before , " he said .
Bangladesh 's policy of friendship and peaceful relations with neighbors had brought positive results in recent years , according to the foreign minister .
Often " we are blamed for delay " in responding to developments in the international arena without going into the reasons , but " delay can also bring dividend , " he pointed out , referring to the country 's initiative in lessening tension in the subcontinent following the nuclear explosions by India and Pakistan in May .
" We can very fairly claim to have played a role in lessening tension in the subcontinent following the nuclear explosions , " which was appreciated " by international fora including the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement , " Azad said .
He emphasized that mediation and understanding were accepted norms to achieve success in international relations , citing as an example the dialog between Bangladesh and Pakistan on the repatriating stranded Pakistanis in the country .
