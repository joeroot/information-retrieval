Thai Shrimp Farmers to Stage Protest
BANGKOK , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Thousands of Thai black tiger prawn farmers threatened to travel to the capital and rally outside the Government House if the government continues to ignore their plight , the Bangkok Post reported Sunday .
The farmers are from the southern provinces of Nakhon Si Thammarat , Songkhla , Surat Thani and Pattani .
Shrimp farmers ' groups said that since the beginning of this year , the price of Thailand 's famous black tiger prawns has dropped by as much as 40 percent .
The situation has affected over a million shrimp farmers in 35 of Thailand 's 76 provinces .
The groups said the government has refused to respond to calls for help despite the fact that the black tiger prawns were a major export item , bringing into the country some 50 billion baht ( 1.35 billion U.S. dollars ) every year .
The farmers want a welfare fund of at least 3 billion baht ( 81.1 million dollars ) to be set up to subsidize shrimp prices , the same way the government has done to help sugarcane farmers and rubber planters .
The groups said 100 representatives of shrimp farmers in the four southern provinces will submit proposals to the prime minister .
If the government takes no action , about 10,000 shrimp farmers will rally outside the Government House , they said .
