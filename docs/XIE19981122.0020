Turkey Slams Italy for Granting Asylum to PKK Leader
ANKARA , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz Saturday strongly condemned Italy for granting political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan .
Speaking at the sixth congress of the Motherland Party here , Yilmaz said Turkey would not leave Italy 's act unanswered .
Ocalan , leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party ( PKK ) , was detained by Italian police in Rome where he arrived by a Russian airlines passenger plane on November 12 .
Italy 's Court of Appeal rejected a Turkish warrant for the arrest of the PKK leader under the Italian law barring extradition to countries where suspects faces the death penalty .
Ocalan left the hospital outside Rome on Saturday where he had been in custody since his arrest for a private residence in the capital .
Meanwhile , Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said on the same day that the Italian government had made a mistake by overruling the Turkish warrant for the arrest of Ocalan .
The PKK led by Ocalan has been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey , which has claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984 .
