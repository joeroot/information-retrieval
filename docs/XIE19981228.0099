Estrada Vows to Defend Constitution
MANILA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada Monday vowed to defend the constitution with his life as he rejected calls by the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao .
Estrada said in an interview that his administration would do all it can to get the MILF to the government side and finally end Muslim rebel movements in the south .
The MILF earlier stated that it would keep fighting for a separate Islamic state in the southern part of the country , despite efforts of the government to talk peace with the Muslim group .
In asserting his group 's position , Ghazil Jaafar , MILF deputy chairman , said , " We will not compromise our demand for independence , " adding that their demand is " non-negotiable . "
Reacting to this , Estrada said , " I have sworn to defend the constitution when I assumed office as president ...
I will defend it with my life . "
He vowed to go all-out against the MILF , should the Muslim separate group insist on pushing for a separate Islamic state , even as he expressed his administration 's determination to " maximize all remedies to win them over . "
