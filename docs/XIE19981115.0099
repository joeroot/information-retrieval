Russia Evacuates Embassy Staff From Iraq
BAGHDAD , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Russia on Sunday morning evacuated some 80 of its non-essential embassy staff and family members from Iraq for fear that the U.S. could launch military strikes against Iraq , diplomatic sources said .
The sources told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that the embassy staff and their family members left Baghdad at 10 a.m. local time , and that they would go back to Moscow via Iran , instead of Amman , Jordan .
This came as the United States National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said on Saturday that Iraq 's offer to allow the United Nations inspections to resume was " unacceptable , " and the U.S. remained poised for military action against Iraq .
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , saying Iraq would allow an unconditional resumption of U.N. weapons inspections , a move many observers believe that will possibly ward off an imminent U.S. military strike .
Annan termed the Iraqi decision as " positive " , saying that he believed it met U.N. requirements in resolving the latest crisis .
However , Berger said the Iraqi offer was " neither unequivocal nor uncondtional , " referring to the two-page annex attached to the letter to Annan .
In response , Iraqi envoy to the U.N. Nazar Hamdoun said in New York Saturday the annex was not linked with the letter , and it was just what Iraq hoped to see after it resumed cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors .
He reiterated that the Iraqi decision was unconditional .
Iraqi leadership on October 31 decided to halt all forms of cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq ( UNSCOM ) until the U.N. Security Council moves toward lifting the trade sanctions imposed on it after its 1990 invation of Kuwait .
The Security Council in an announcement on November 5 condemned the Iraqi move and urged it to rescind the decision immediately and unconditionally .
The U.S. has been stepping up its military presence in the Gulf in preparation for an attack to force Iraq to reverse course .
