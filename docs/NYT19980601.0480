WASHINGTON _ Concerned about the growing power of leftist rebels in Colombia , the Clinton administration is expanding its support for government forces fighting in the hemisphere 's longest-running guerrilla war .
U.S. officials say the aid is aimed at stanching the flow of illegal drugs from Colombia , and will target the insurgents only where they protect the production of heroin and cocaine .
The officials say they have no intention of getting mired in Colombia 's internal conflict .
But government documents and interviews with dozens of officials here indicate that the separation Washington has tried to make between those two campaigns _ one against drug trafficking , the other against the guerrillas _ is increasingly breaking down .
Officials say more U.S. training and equipment are going to shore up basic deficiencies in the tactics , mobility and firepower of the Colombian military , rather than for operations directed at the drug trade .
Faced with a string of rebel victories , including a devastating ambush of Colombian troops in March , U.S. generals have embarked on an ambitious effort to help reorganize the Colombian army .
According to senior U.S. officials , the Clinton administration has also been considering options that officials said include additional military training , provision of more sophisticated helicopters and materiel , and creation of a high-tech intelligence center that would be run by U.S. officials on Colombian soil .
The limits of U.S. involvement in Colombia are still largely set by the constraints on military , intelligence and foreign-aid spending in the aftermath of the Cold War .
Compared with the billions of dollars poured into Central America during the 1980s , the hundred million or so that the United States now spends annually on Colombia remains relatively modest .
Yet administration officials have begun to describe Colombia as another grave strategic risk .
If the rebels and the drug traffickers bond more closely , the officials warn , both could become greater threats to the region .
Colombia 's troubles could spill across its borders toward the Venezuelan oil fields , the United States ' chief source of imported petroleum , or into Panama , home to the vital Panama Canal .
Colombia 's stability , they contend , is a responsibility from which the United States can not run .
`` This is not a one-night stand , '' said the commander of U.S. military forces in Latin America and the Caribbean , Gen. Charles Wilhelm .
`` This is a marriage for life . ''
Such admonitions come at an especially delicate political moment in Colombia , where a new president will be chosen in a run-off election on June 21 .
While Washington 's concerns about the country have risen over the last year , Colombian leaders were cutting their military spending and suggesting a new willingness to negotiate with the insurgents .
Business groups are pressing for peace talks with the rebels , and last month thousands of Colombians rallied against the violence .
Both the candidates who emerged from the first round of presidential elections on Sunday have said they would make new efforts to reach a settlement .
The evolving U.S. policy is also the subject of a growing debate , one almost as sharp in the administration as outside it .
At one end are officials who can not consider the Colombia plans without seeing Central American ghosts .
They point to cases in which more than a dozen Colombian army units given anti-drug training by the United States were later linked to serious human-rights violations in the fight against the rebels .
At the other end are officials who believe that even the most ambitious policy proposals are inadequate , and that whatever the final administration plan , political sensitivities will ensure that it falls well short of Colombia 's needs .
`` We 're afraid to use the ` I ' word , '' said an official who is influential in the Colombia policy 's design .
`` We should be able to say with a straight face , and without feeling like we have to go to confession , that there is an insurgency problem in Colombia that threatens the stability of the country . ''
More quietly , other voices in the government are challenging important arguments at the source of Washington 's alarm .
For instance , administration officials have argued that a boom in the cultivation of coca in southern Colombia has brought the guerrillas a dangerous windfall .
They say the rebels , by in effect renting their forces to protect those who grow coca and refine cocaine , have been able to pay for new recruits , better weapons and more aggressive strikes against the government .
But intelligence officials have said that there is scant evidence of a major change in the insurgents ' relationship with the traffickers , and that the impact of Colombia 's coca boom on the availability of drugs in the United States is probably not great .
