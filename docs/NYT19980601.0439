With a Song on Your Web
Listen carefully : Is that the song of a cerulean warbler outside your window ?
If you aren n't sure _ and most people aren n't , even while looking at a bird book _ a new Web site will play the song for you .
The site has been designed to help scholars collect information from birders to build a database on North American wood warblers .
Some of the 51 species are endangered or threatened , and all will migrate thousands of miles to nest and breed from April through July .
The Web project marks the first online census of the warbler migration , a project set up by the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society .
The site for sightings is http://birdsource.cornell.edu.
At the Web site , you can learn which states have the most sightings ( New York , Pennsylvania , Texas and Florida ) , or the greatest variety by species ( Texas , Pennsylvania , Ohio and Louisiana ) .
The site 's goal is to track these thumb-sized birds of yellow , blue , red , green , black and white , who sing with a range of rich warbles or trills or rings , and to improve the data on the routes of the warblers , whose annual commute from South and Central America homeward to Canada and the United States typically covers thousands of miles .
Birders are asked to respond to questions and post observations .
The site has received more than 2,200 reports .
Making the Best of It
Waste from factory-style livestock farms is a growing source of pollution around the country .
Now the Research Service of the federal Department of Agriculture is exploring a factory-style solution to the problem : a 77,000-square-foot composting center that can handle 100 tons of cow and poultry manure and used livestock bedding a day .
The center opened last fall on the service 's farm in Beltsville , Md. One area of emphasis has been finding rapid techniques for bulk composting of organic byproducts , in which the heat produced _ temperatures in a heap can top 130 degrees _ kills all disease organisms .
Waste trucked into the center is dumped in one of 20 rows , each 160 feet long , 5 feet wide and 40 inches high .
The rows , called windrows , are churned once a week by a machine to speed decomposition by letting in more air .
Most of the rows are fully `` cooked '' in 12 weeks .
But the center has more ambitious goals , said Lawrence J. Sikora , a microbiologist for the research service .
He and his colleagues hope to develop designer composts , mixes of farm , industrial and urban materials that can be used to prevent particular diseases in crops .
Once Upon a Magnetar
Traces of a dark relic of a once-bright star 40,000 light-years from Earth have confirmed the existence of a class of neutron stars called magnetars , according to a team of scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala.
The team said the magnetars have the most intense magnetic fields observed in the universe , fields one thousand trillion times the Earth 's magnetic field .
The fields can heat the star 's surface to 18 million degrees .
The discovery of magnetars points to vast new frontiers in space , said Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou , a gamma-ray astronomer at the center who directed the team .
`` It gets at many mysteries , '' she said .
Many such neutron stars still exist , she added , but are burned out and have been almost impossible to observe in the spectrums in which they are usually observed .
`` We couldn n't understand where they had all gone , '' Dr. Kouveliotou said .
`` Now we know they still exist .
There may be hundreds of thousands around us , maybe millions .
Now we can start looking at other ways they show themselves . ''
Using satellite data , her team measured the fields by assessing how the speed of rotation of the star is slowing , which is linked to the power of the magnetic field .
A neutron star is one that has collapsed because of gravitational forces .
Neutron stars are created in supernovae explosions and spin at rates up to hundreds of revolutions per second .
A magnetar has a magnetic field that is 100 times stronger than the typical neutron star .
A report on the discovery was in the May 21 issue of the journal Nature .
