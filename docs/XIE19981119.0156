Indonesia on Right Track to Economic Recovery , Says
JAKARTA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesia is indeed on the right track toward economic recovery but its efforts are not only aimed at regaining the growth it had enjoyed in the past , Coordinating Minister for Economy , Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said .
" Our aim is to create a development framework that will create a new society , combining the emergence of private and public sectors , both operating within a strengthened , legal , and administrative framework that will ensure transparency , " he said .
Opening the Indonesian Forum here on Thursday , Ginandjar said the government realizes that economic growth would be useless unless it creates an educated and healthy society which could actively participate in the country 's economic and political life and unless there is an even distribution of the fruits of development .
The two-day forum was attended by the World Bank 's country director for Indonesia Dennis de Tray and hundreds of Indonesian and foreign businessmen as well as politicians .
Ginandjar said the riots and lootings that broke out in the city last week did not affect the economy as could be seen from the strengthening of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar .
The rupiah continued to strengthen from 7,775 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday last week to 7,700 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday this week .
He said the government continues to focus on economic recovery through a reform package that includes bank restructuring .
" Recapitalizing our banks is among our highest priorities , " he said , adding that the country 's private sector debt should be settled soon .
He urged creditors to negotiate a reasonable settlement but debtors must also offer an honest appraisal of the value of their assets and expected revenues .
Ginandjar also said that the country is pinning its hope on the commitment of the Chinese government not to devalue the Chinese yuan , on the commitment of the Japanese government to continue assisting crisis-hit nations , and on the commitment of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum ( APEC ) leaders to help Asia overcome its recession .
Meanwhile , Dennis de Tray said the economic crisis that Indonesia has been facing has been compounded by the drought and forest fires that hit some parts of the archipelago last year .
Asked how Indonesia would step toward economic recovery , he said the country needs more open dialogues between the various sectors of society so that everyone could agree on how to rebuild the economy .
The country also needs to lay a strong political foundation that would support economic recovery , he added .
