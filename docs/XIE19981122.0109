KATHMANDU , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Nepal and India have agreed to renew the bilateral transit treaty before its expiry on December 5 , press reports here said Sunday .
The Indo-Nepal talks in this regard concluded last Friday in New Delhi and India agreed to simplify the transit procedures for Nepal , The Kathmandu Post said , quoting a joint press statement .
The two sides had held four-day preliminary talks in Kathmandu in September .
The daily said India agreed in principle to the automatic renewal of the treaty every seven years , another request made by the Nepali side .
India reiterated its commitment to finish the work on the extension of the broad-gauge rail link between Raxual ( India ) and Sirsia ( Nepal ) before the completion of the construction of the Inland Container Depot ( ICD ) at Sirsia .
The work on the extension of the rail link is being financed and carried out by the Indian government , the English-language paper said .
The Indian side agreed in principle to the Nepali request for the establishment of regular freight train service between the ICD at Sirsia and the Calcutta port in India , on which Nepal depends heavily on for foreign trade .
India agreed to provide increased storage area at the Calcutta port to further facilitate the movement of Nepali cargo , the newspaper said .
It said a bilateral agreement on regulation of trans-border movement of motor vehicles is under consideration and both sides acknowledged that its early conclusion would greatly facilitate cross-border operations of passenger and cargo vehicles .
Nepal and India share a 1,750-km-long border which is open to each other .
The newspaper said the two sides also exchanged views on cooperation between the two governments in preventing unauthorized trade and expressed their determination to take all necessary measures to combat such practices .
The draft of the treaty has to be endorsed by the cabinets of the two countries .
As a land-locked country , Nepal largely depends on the transit routes through India for foreign trade .
