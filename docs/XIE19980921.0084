South Korea to Cut Defense Budget for 1999
SEOUL , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- South Korean Defense Ministry Monday presented a defense budget draft of 13.75 trillion won ( 990 million U.S. dollars ) for fiscal 1999 to the National Assembly , or parliament , for consideration .
Under the draft budget , the ministry called for a total of 13.75 trillion won for next year , a 50 billion won ( 36 million U.S. dollars ) less than this year 's 13.8 trillion won ( 993.6 million U.S. dollars .
The proposed budget is divided into 4.14 trillion won ( 298 million U.S. dollars ) of defense improvement costs and 9.6 trillion won ( 690 million U.S. dollars ) of operation and maintenance expenditures .
If the budget plan is approved by the parliament , it will mark the first decrease of the nation 's defense budget since the foundation of the military 50 years ago .
The country 's defense budget has steadily grown by 9.3 - 12.6 percent in the past years .
The budget plan came when the nation is suffering deteriorating economy , which was spurred by a financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions late last year .
