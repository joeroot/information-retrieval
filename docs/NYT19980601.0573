_ Despite a healthy economy , Nassau County could be running a $ 30 million deficit by the end of the year if sales tax revenues continue to lag behind budget projections , the county comptroller said on Monday .
`` There is a distinct possibility of significant budgetary shortfalls this year , '' and `` decisive action is warranted with regard to some key areas , '' the comptroller , Frederick Parola , said in his mid-year review of the county 's $ 2.3 billion budget for 1998 .
Expected sales tax revenues appear to be running $ 15 million to $ 20 million behind projections , he said , based on a multi-year trend and 1998 first-quarter receipts .
Parola also said the county had budgeted more than $ 25 million from land sales , including the sale of one parcel that that the county does not yet own .
One major sale , that of the Nassau County Medical Center and nursing home , appears to be proceeding on schedule , he said .
However , Parola warned that failure to complete this transaction would result in a $ 36 million shortfall .
On the positive side , Parola said the county could benefit from $ 10 million in unexpected investment income and a potential $ 17 million savings in debt service .
Revenues from Offtrack Betting could run $ 4 million over expectations , and recently enacted recreation fee increases could bring in an additional $ 1.6 million in revenue , he said .
