& UR ; ( UNDATED ) _ ... Time to collapse .
& QL ;
We set up camp just 10 feet or so from the river 's edge .
There we cooked our meals , wash ed up , slept .
At night , the five of us would gather to eat dinner , talk and joke , and wait for the stars to come out .
Wildlife was seemingly scarce , but on one evening a group of bats swooped above our heads , presumably seeking their own dinner of insects .
This went on for about a half-hour : the bat stage show for tourists from the big city .
On our first full day camping by the river , we thought a day hike was in order .
Although it might seem more logical to rest one 's weary legs ( whic h get the brunt of the abuse ) , going on a moderate excursion is a better idea .
It loosens tight muscles and helps make you whole again .
I learned about what Canyon hikers call `` exposure . ''
This means the trail you 're on has areas in which a c areless step would mean sure injury .
Like dropping off a cliff .
Our day hike toward Lava Canyon Rapids , roughly two hours northeast , was said to have some of these exposure areas .
As it turned out , without our backpacks and by using care , the exposures were no problem .
It was a beautiful day for a beach picnic , there by the Colorado .
We took our lunches and a purifier to pump water for the return trip .
Eager to help , and to learn about camping lore , I offered to help pump the w ater .
A little too eager : While I was working the pump 's lever , a key plastic part snapped .
Luckily , the experience of my fellow campers showed in the axiom `` Always have two . ''
We had another pump back at camp .
Our days down by the river were simple and sweet .
Awakened by the dawn , a simple breakfast of instant oatmeal or a bagel and wonderful , wonderful coffee .
One team member would not compromise on that , thank goodness , and brought a whole pound of premium blend .
The first cu p in the crisp morning air is the stuff caffeine dreams are made of .
Small , light hammocks were a nifty accessory for three of the crew .
They strung them up between mesquite trees for a siesta .
I sat near the constantly roaring river and read ,
or let my mind wander .
I slept one night out of the tent , with the sleeping bag on the ground .
After the sun went down , we picked out the Big Dipper , off near the eastern horizon .
During the night , I happened to wake up and see the Dipper again , this time directly overhead , the sparkling centerpiece of a sky filled with stars .
& QL ; & QL ;
All too soon , it was time to plan our trip out .
We would split the uphill effort in half , camping near the trail at Asinine Hill .
It was hard to
leave our little home by the roaring rapids , but I didn n't know yet how hard .
The walk back to the rim was something I 'd dreaded almost from the first time I took the expedition seriously .
Now , it finally was beginning .
Suffice it to say it tu rned out to be the hardest physical challenge of my life .
The main thing was to just put one foot in front of the other , I kept telling myself .
At least the distractions were plentiful .
While huffing and puffing , I could look to my left and se e incomparable beauty .
Having a small tape recorder playing Aaron Copeland 's `` Appalachian Spring '' in my earphones didn n't hurt .
Trudging up Asinine Hill was the toughest , but the two of us in the back of the pack finally made it , as the other s called from a bluff where they had set up the tent .
The awesome view was matched by the wind , which was playing havoc with our nylon tent .
We scrambled to lash our shelter down , but the gale had other ideas , tearing the tie-down straps in th e process .
Acknowledging this force of nature , we sought and found a lower campsite with more natural protection .
After a last , cold camping night , we awoke to a glorious day , perfect for hiking .
I was getting the hang of it now .
With less foo d and water , the pack was lighter , and I finally had the straps adjusted about right .
Despite being one of the slower hikers , I was not always in the back of our group .
I took the lead after our midmorning break , and began the last ascent alon e.
It was a special time ; indescribable , really , in the feeling of solitude , and of the belief that life could be simple : just one foot in front of the other .
It started getting colder again , and we saw patches of snow as we stopped for lunch to refuel for the last push of our trek , back to the rim .
& QL ; & QL ;
Slowly , more snow appeared on the trail , though because we were going uphill and had better footing , we tried and succeeded on marching through without crampons .
I had
fallen to the end of the pack again .
During lunch , there was the inevitable attempt to gauge how much time we had left to hike .
By 2 p.m. , we guessed , it all would be over but the celebrating .
Walking was even slower now , due to the snow un derfoot and my fatigue , but I kept at it .
Then , up above , I heard rebel yells .
I dared not hope that the hike would be shorter than we thought .
But then I saw signs _ certain trees , or turns in the trail _ that I remembered from the trip down .
The realization came to me that , indeed , I was almost up and out of the Canyon .
As I staggered near the trailhead sign , there were the others , camera ready to capture the finish .
`` Give us a yell ! ''
they called .
What they got was a whimpe r.
& QL ; & QL ;
In days immediately following the hike , the temptation was to think of it as a life-altering experience .
With time , I 've found that 's not quite the case , but it 's close .
What stuck was a renewed feeling of confidence in my abil ity to set a goal and achieve it ; that , with hard work , I still could do something difficult .
I can , indeed , push myself when the goal is worthy .
Rather than feeling insignificant amid the grandeur of one of the wonders of the world , I felt re newed , and sorted out .
There was a light at the end of my middle-age tunnel .
