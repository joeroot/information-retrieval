SILVER LAUNCH FORCED TO WITHDRAW FROM BELMONT ( JT )
By JOSEPH DURSO c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
Nick Zito , who lost Halory Hunter five days before the Preakness with an ankle injury , lost his shot at the Belmont Stakes Monday when an ankle injury forced him to withdraw Silver Launch six days before the final race in the Triple Crown .
The injury to Silver Launch left a prospective field of 11 for the 130th running of the Belmont , not counting Grand Slam , the winner of the Peter Pan Stakes one week ago .
Grand Slam 's status is still being evaluated by his trainer , D. Wayne Lukas , who has to decide by Thursday morning whether to enter the colt .
Grand Slam , winner of the Belmont Futurity and the Champagne Stakes last fall , was severely cut on the leg during the Breeders ' Cup Juvenile and did not run in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness .
But he ran powerfully in the Peter Pan .
Silver Launch 's injury was detected Sunday afternoon at Belmont Park when he began favoring his right leg , which seemed to be swollen .
Zito called Dr. Jim Hunt , who took X-rays of both legs , found a chip in the left ankle and reasoned that the right leg was swollen from stress because the colt had been babying his left leg .
`` I really think we could have had fun in the race , '' Zito said .
`` Maybe not win it , but be up there . ''
Silver Launch , who figured to be a long shot in the Belmont , has won two of his 13 starts and ran in the money seven times .
In his most recent appearance , he ran second to Thomas Jo in the Sir Barton Stakes at Pimlico on Preakness Day .
There was no racing Monday at Belmont Park , but a festive mood was gathering in anticipation of Real Quiet 's attempt to become the 12th horse to win the Triple Crown .
Real Quiet , who won the Kentucky Derby by half a length and the Preakness by two and a quarter lengths _ both times beating Victory Gallop _ will earn a $ 5 million bonus if he sweeps the three races .
This marks the second year in a row that his trainer , Bob Baffert of California , is taking aim at the feat .
He got there last year with Silver Charm , who missed winning the Belmont by three-quarters of a length to Touch Gold .
Baffert was keeping Real Quiet in virtual seclusion at Churchill Downs before flying his horse to New York tomorrow .
Real Quiet galloped a mile and three-eighths Monday morning , and will work five furlongs Tuesday before being shipped to Belmont Wednesday .
`` Things are very boring here , '' Baffert said from Churchill Downs .
`` But things are good .
He looks good .
He 's put all his weight back that he lost after the Preakness . ''
Kent Desormeaux , who rode Real Quiet in the Derby and the Preakness , was planning to fly from his home in Los Angeles to Louisville to join Baffert and the colt 's owner , Mike Pegram , before traveling together to New York .
The jockey said he had been pumping Gary Stevens , who rode Silver Charm in last year 's Triple Crown , for advice on the final act in the drama .
`` I pinned Gary in a corner and tried to get everything from him on how to conduct myself this week , '' Desormeaux said .
`` He 's been there .
I know that it 's the opportunity of a lifetime .
`` I have no doubt this horse can go a mile and a half .
We don n't run that distance too often .
It takes a lot out of a horse .
But if there is any horse today who can get a mile and a half , it 's Real Quiet .
He 's no sprinter . ''
Mike Pegram , who bought Real Quiet as a yearling for $ 17 , 000 , agreed that the distance would not defeat the horse .
`` The distance will not be a problem , '' Pegram said .
`` If we lose the race , it will not be because he had to run an extra quarter-mile beyond the Kentucky Derby . ''
On the Belmont track early Monday morning , Parade Ground put in his final breeze , going five furlongs in 1 : 02 .
At Churchill Downs , the Lukas colt Yarrow Brae worked five furlongs in 1 : 00 4 / 5.
Most of the other horses preparing to take their shot at Real Quiet were expected to hold final workouts Tuesday or Wednesday after heavy rainstorms Sunday night made the track muddy and forced them to delay their countdown to the main event .
