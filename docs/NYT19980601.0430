CAN THE SHOW GO ON ?
STAR 'S DEMISE DOESN ' T ALWAYS DOOM A TV SHOW
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By KEN PARISH PERKINS c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
`` NewsRadio '' has always been considered the tough little show that could , living the perilous life of a series mighty close to being axed , yet surviving at the last possible moment with a miraculous reprieve .
But can it survive this ?
Phil Hartman 's death last week , reportedly at the hands of his wife , who later fatally shot herself , has the creators of the NBC situation comedy shaken and perplexed about exactly how to move on .
The series , which will start its fourth season in the fall , focused on the quirky workaday lives of the staff of a struggling radio station .
Hartman had been part of a relatively unknown though deeply talented ensemble cast , playing Bill McNeal , the manipulative news anchor with a healthy respect for himself and a mere tolerance for others .
It 's hard enough to write major characters out of the script without enduring some viewer backlash , as `` Homicide : Life on the Street '' and `` NYPD Blue '' will find out next season without their respective stars , Andre Braugher and Jimmy Smits .
But when a regular character dies , putting producers in the position of writing out a character without the character being around , you have to address it in a way that 's both apropos and sensible for an audience that is , for the most part , grieving for a fictional character to whom they can n't give a proper farewell .
When John Hancock , 51 , died of a heart attack at his Los Angeles home in 1992 , he was co-starring in the CBS comedy `` Love and War '' as the gruff but lovable bartender of a bar frequented by the show 's romantic leads , played by Susan Dey and Jay Thomas .
Series creator Diane English shut down production for a week .
In the show , Hancock 's character also died of a heart attack , and the principal characters reminisced about the bartender , with the aid of funny and touching clips .
Hancock was a big , burly guy playing a distinctive character whose presence was missed .
His absence may not have been the sole reason the series was eventually canceled , but it couldn n't possibly have hurt .
Stars far more essential to the original premise of a series can cause a considerable number of creative problems , often fatal ones .
`` Chico and the Man '' was gone within a year after star Freddie Prinze committed suicide in 1977 .
And when Redd Foxx died 23 days after the premiere of his family sitcom , `` The Royal Family , '' in 1991 , its producers knew it would be hard pressed to rebound .
It was .
`` The Royal Family '' was quickly taken off the air and retooled .
It returned with actress Jackee ( now on `` Sister , Sister '' ) as Foxx 's sister-in-law , but audiences rejected it , and CBS quickly canceled the series .
The sitcom `` Too Close for Comfort '' had found a comfortable life in syndication after ABC canceled the series .
Then its star , Ted Knight , died of cancer in 1986 at age 62 .
The producers wanted to write him out and move on , but stations weren n't convinced the show could succeed without him , even though he was missing in episodes during his illness .
They balked , and the series ended .
In the fall of 1984 , Jon-Erik Hexum , 26 , playfully held a prop gun loaded with blanks to his head and pulled the trigger .
He was critically injured and died six days later .
In a month , the CBS drama `` Cover Up , '' in which Hexum played Mac Harper , an undercover operative traveling the world to help Americans in trouble overseas , was back on the air with another actor playing the lead .
It was explained that Hexum 's character had been killed in action , and a short filmed tribute was part of that episode .
The series wasn n't renewed after failing to find an audience .
Some transitions go smoothly .
During the third season of `` Cheers '' in 1985 , Nicholas Colasanto , who played the dimwitted but cuddly bartender , Coach , died after a long illness .
The series was already established , and Colasanto hadn n't appeared for several weeks before his death .
As a result , Colasanto 's character was phased out over several episodes .
His death , at the end of the season , also gave the show 's creators time to recast the role , which went to then-unknown Woody Harrelson , who also played a character with a missing bulb or two .
( Only trivia buffs can even remember Colasanto 's name these days . )
There was also 58-year-old Michael Conrad , Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on `` Hill Street Blues , '' who died of cancer in 1983 .
On the NBC cop drama , Conrad was known for the opening scenes of roll call when he 'd tell officers to `` Be careful out there , '' as they headed out for street duty .
His final episode was perhaps the most memorable , because writers dreamed up the scenario of his character `` dying happy '' while in bed with a woman .

In true `` Hill Street Blues '' fashion , the final shot was of Sgt. Esterhaus ' ashes being scattered on the city 's streets , only to be swept up by a street cleaner .
Others are trickier .
Larry Riley , then 39 , died of AIDS while playing the policeman-turned-attorney Frank Williams on `` Knots Landing . ''
His character was promptly sent to visit his daughter at a Midwestern college and simply written out of future scripts .
No one seemed to notice .
And then there were the back-to-back deaths on `` Night Court . ''
First Selma Diamond , playing a court bailiff in the comedy that starred Harry Anderson as a comical judge , died of lung cancer at age 64 .
The opening show of the season dealt with fellow bailiff Bull Shannon 's ( Richard Moll ) reaction to her character 's death .
She was replaced with Florence Halop , who just a year later would die of cancer at age 63 .
In the opening show of the 1986 - 87 season , Anderson 's Judge Stone invoked the memory of both characters during a personal crisis .
It became a morbid , though funny , running gag in Hollywood that Halop 's replacement , Marsha Warfield , was doomed .
But Warfield was alive and well through the series ' end in 1992 .
In the early days of television , the solution would have been to simply cast a new actor in the same role .
Audiences accepted it then _ there wasn n't much of an uproar when Dick Sargent replaced Dick York as the husband on `` Bewitched '' _ but contemporary audiences tend to find such changes unacceptable .
( Does this say something about the blurred lines of fantasy and reality ? )
For a series on the proverbial bubble of renewal and cancellation , the loss of a key character can be crippling .
Which is what `` NewsRadio '' may be facing .
Although critics have praised the series for its sharp writing and engaging characters , viewers have not embraced the show .
Even in its second season , sandwiched between hits `` Mad About You '' and `` Frasier '' on Tuesdays , it barely made the top 70 out of 158 series .
Still , this fall `` NewsRadio '' had earned a new Wednesday slot between `` 3rd Rock From the Sun '' at 8 and the law drama `` Law & AMP ; Order '' at 9.
What may help '' NewsRadio '' is its strong ensemble cast .
Despite his `` Saturday Night Live '' credentials , Hartman was a support player .
The series centers on the low-key , boyish Dave Foley as Dave Nelson , a mild-mannered station manager presiding over a cast of misfits .
The series has one of the better casts on television with Foley , a former comedy troupe member of Kids in the Hall , and the hapless naif of a reporter , Andy Dick , a master of improvisation .
Khandi Alexander left the series this season , but the cast still includes Vicki Lewis as a mischievous secretary , Joe Rogan as a conspiracy-theorizing technician , Maura Tierney as the insecure news writer and Stephen Root as the rich but clueless station owner .
Ironically , Hartman 's death may give `` NewsRadio '' a new fan base , as curious viewers sample the summer reruns .
For that reason alone , its first episode in the fall will probably draw a sizable audience .
As for the producers , they are probably only now starting to take stock , looking at the future of their series and what needs to be done to retool it .
It is , perhaps , the most unpleasant part .
It 's where you have to start thinking about what Hartman 's death means in terms of not just emotion , but the reality of business .
