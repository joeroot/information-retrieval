Statistical Services in Africa Need Support : ECA
ADDIS ABABA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) said here Thursday that the statistical services in Africa need support and pledged its continued assistance .
In a press release marking this years ' African Statistics Day which falls on November 18 , the ECA said it will continue to assist in coordinating statistical development within the framework of the Coordinating Committee on African Statistical Development .
The ECA is aimed to increase the public awareness of the important role of statistics in the socio-economic development of the African continent .
It said that statistical information has a crucial role to play in the achievement of sustainable social and economic development .
Regular , reliable and complete statistical information is indispensable for research , sound decision-making , and in the planning of economic and social development , it added .
However , the ECA noted that since the mid-1980s , most countries in Africa have experienced a major decline in budgetary resources allocated to support statistical activities .
With a view to reversing the negative trend , the Conference of African Ministers adopted in May 1990 the Addis Ababa Plan of Action for Statistical Development in Africa responsible for planning and economic development in a bid to achieve national self-sufficiency in statistical production by the end of the century .
Important progress has been achieved in the area of statistical production and data quality , said the ECA .
But , it noted that national statistical offices in Africa still face three challenges :
Firstly , how to meet the needs of both the public and private sectors for timely , accurate and reliable statistical information ;
Secondly , the need for greater client focus and responsiveness to be able to respond rapidly to changing information needs ;
And thirdly , how to exploit and harness the new information and communication technologies to provide reliable information in cost-effective manner .
The ECA said that it will continue to assist in capacity building at the national level in the areas of policy advocacy , consensus building , harmonization of statistical classifications , standards and methods .
The theme of the African Statistics Day this year is " harnessing information for development . "
