China 's Cinemas Get Support From Blockbusters ( 1 )
BEIJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- While American blockbusters are attracting most Chinese moviegoers , cinemas nationwide are trying to improve their sound equipment to cater to an increasingly fastidious audience .
Several years of production and publishing reforms have made money-earners out of Chinese cinemas , but industry insiders are warning of problems if extensive changes don n't take place .
" We should make money from the industry instead of squandering investment on film-making , " says Chen Shuping , deputy general manager of the Dizhi ( geology ) Auditorium , one of Beijing 's most luxurious and profitable cinemas .
For the past four decades , China 's film-makers , publishers , and cinemas have kept in line with the planned economy , and film-makers , who followed official requests , took little notice of financial returns for their dull products .
Box office receipts fell 470 million yuan ( about 57 million U.S. dollars ) in 1992 , and there were 3.84 billion fewer viewers than in the previous year .
Six of the 16 film studios in China were running in the red at the time .
