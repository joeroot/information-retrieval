Thailand to Benefit from Snooker Draw in Asian Games
BANGKOK , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The draw for snooker may justify Thai goal of reaping two to three gold medals in the sport in the upcoming 13th Asian Games , local reports quoted Thai snooker officials as saying on Sunday .
Home hero James Wattana , top seed of the competition , will receive a bye for the second round to take on the winner from a match between the Philippines and Hongkong , China .
Third-seeded Marco Fu of Hong Kong , China , will become Wattana 's main rival in the tournament .
However , Fu who also receives the first-round bye , has to survive the tough challenges first from many strong players , including second-seeded Shokat Ali of Pakistan , and Phaitoon Pholboon of Thailand , in the preliminary matches .
Thailand also enjoyes great advantages over its opponents in the double and team competition .
The Thais will surely enter the finals and win the title by beating the Pakistani squad , and Wattana , paired with Tai Pic , will outwit their opponents from Hong Kong , China , to pocket the doubles ' gold , estimated an official from the Snooker Association of Thailand .
