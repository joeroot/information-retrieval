CLINTON LEGAL TACTIC COULD KEEP LID ON KEY INFORMATION & HT ; By JULIA MALONE & HT ; c.1998 Cox News Service
WASHINGTON _ President Clinton 's decision Monday to focus on the attorney-client privilege to prevent a key aide 's testimony could substantially delay the unraveling of the Monica Lewinsky matter .
Although Clinton abandoned his defense of executive privilege in briefs sent to the Supreme Court , he dug in on efforts to shield his closest confidant , Bruce Lindsey , from having to answer crucial questions from independent counsel Kenneth Starr .
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson , in an opinion that cites secret information , has already ruled that Lindsey must answer Starr 's questions .
Starr , citing procedures used in the Watergate investigation of President Nixon , has asked the Supreme Court to skip the appeals court level and give an expedited June hearing on the issue .
In its response to Starr , Clinton argued that the question of attorney-client privilege has still not been resolved and requires a full airing at the appeals court level .
`` The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out , '' said White House counsel Charles Ruff said .
`` That 's what courts generally do .
This is not steel seizure , this is not Iranian hostages , this is not U.S. vs. Nixon . ''
If the high court agrees , that would delay a final ruling until next fall or winter at the soonest whether Lindsey must answer Starr 's questions that the White House has refused to let him answer .
Lindsey , a White House deputy counsel , has coordinated much of the administration 's response to allegations that Clinton had a sexual liaison with former White House intern Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it .
Thus , Lindsey is widely seen as the key witness who could tell whether or not there has been an attempt to tamper with witnesses or suborn perjury .
`` Bruce Lindsey may know a great deal , '' said C. Boyden Gray , former White House counsel in the Bush administration .
`` There are hints that there may be some fertile ground to plow , '' especially in allegations that Lindsey may have `` coached '' witnesses before they testified to the Starr grand jury , Gray said .
Although predicting what the nine justices will decide is always risky , experts said Monday that legal arguments might weigh in favor of the White House on giving a long , hard look at the attorney-client claim .
Even critic Gray said that the issue is `` more complicated '' than executive privilege , which courts have already greatly limited .
The courts have already dealt the Clinton administration one defeat on the issue .
The 8th U.S. Court of Appeals last year rejected a claim of confidentiality for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 's conversations with government lawyers after her appearance before Starr 's grand jury .
In that decision , the appeals court ordered all notes to be handed over to Starr .
`` To allow any part of the federal government to use its in-house attorney as a shield against the production of information relevant to a federal criminal investigation would represent a gross misuse of public assets , '' said the appeals court .
The Supreme Court allowed that ruling to stand .
However , Mark Tushnet , professor of law at Georgetown University , said that this decision was not expansive enough to settle the whole question of who in the administration could claim confidentiality and under what circumstances .
That might require a full judicial airing , he said .
`` It 's quite a difficult issue , which the court would do well to see how the court of appeal resolves it , '' he said .
Critics of the White House said Clinton 's decision was based on a desire to delay Starr 's probe .
`` I 'm not sure I wouldn n't do the same thing , '' Gray said of the tactic .
`` They 're better off if they can get past the election . ''
`` If the Democrats retake the House ( where impeachment proceedings must originate ) , then you 're home free , '' he said .
