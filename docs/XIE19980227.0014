UK to Crack Down on Under-Age Lottery Ticket Sales
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Britain 's regulators of the national lottery Thursday ordered a crackdown on selling lottery tickets to children under 16 as a survey showed that 5 percent of the country 's youths are gamblers .
It was reported that Camelot Corp , the consortium that operates the lottery , was demanded by the Office of the National Lottery , which regulates the lottery , to take tougher action against under-age lottery ticket sales .
The move followed a study which found that 549 young people between the ages of 12 and 15 , or about 5 percent of nearly 10,000 surveyed , had a problem with gambling .
In Britain , it is illegal to sell National Lottery tickets or scratch cards to children under 16 , but the survey found that nearly half of those surveyed and those who had bought lottery tickets are under 16 and some children use their lunch money or even steal money to finance their gambling habit .
" Camelot has to shoulder its responsibilities , as do retailers and parents , " the Office of the National Lottery said in a statement .
