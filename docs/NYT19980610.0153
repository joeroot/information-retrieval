DOUGLAS WORKERS EAGER TO SHOW BOEING THEY CAN DO 737 WORK
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By JAMES WALLACE c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
LONG BEACH , Calif. _ Standing inside the Boeing next generation 737 - 700 , John Figueira looked down the length of the gutted fuselage where any day now he and his fellow Douglas aircraft workers will begin to install the lavatories , galley and seats , and complete other interior work that must be done before the plane can be delivered in a few months to Germania Airlines .
`` This right here is our future , literally , '' he said of the 737 .
`` All the people on this program realize that . ''
The plane is one of five 737s that have been flown down from Seattle for final interior work and refurbishment at the underused factory here , which is part of Boeing 's Douglas Products Division as a result of last summer 's merger with the McDonnell Douglas Corp. Five more 737s are still to come as Boeing shifts some work here in an effort to ease production bottlenecks at the Renton plant .
Boeing executives also are seriously considering setting up a 737 production line at the Douglas factory later this year .
A decision is expected before summer 's end .
The next generation 737 - 700 is parked next to a standard 737 at one end of the factory floor of what 's known as Building 80 .
On top of the building is the landmark sign , `` Fly DC Jets . ''
The 737 work area is fenced off from the rest of the factory floor .
Only those with a 737 badge that peeks out from below the standard-issue Boeing badge are allowed inside to work on the planes from Seattle .
Several hundred yards away , at the other end of the factory , a shiny new 717 is being readied for Wednesday 's rollout ceremony .
Boeing executives will be on hand as the company shows off its first 100-seat passenger jet , formerly called the MD-95 because it was designed and sold by McDonnell Douglas before the merger .
But the future of the 717 is uncertain .
Some analysts believe Boeing is going to have a hard time selling the plane to airlines in a niche market .
Even if sales live up to Boeing 's public expectations , many of the 10,000 remaining Douglas workers in Long Beach are destined to lose their jobs .
In January , Boeing announced it would eliminate production of the MD-80 and MD-90 twinjets that are now built in the same building as the 717 .
That will mean the loss of about 3,000 jobs .
The last of the twinjets will roll out the door near the end of next year .
And less than two weeks ago , Boeing said it would also stop production in early 2000 of the unprofitable MD-11 widebody trijet , which is built in an adjacent building .
Scratch another 3,000 or so jobs .
`` The 717 is all that we will have left .
So we really need that new 737 line if Douglas is going to make it , '' said Figueira , the team leader for interior work on the 737s and a 34-year veteran of Douglas .
Figueira is 60 years old .
He plans to retire in two years and move with his wife to Arizona , where he will fish and play golf .
But his son Charles works at Douglas , in tooling .
He 's been with Douglas 10 years .
`` He has a long ways to go , '' Figueira said of his son .
`` This is his future . ''
Assuming , of course , that there is a Douglas factory .
Boeing 's tentative plan to start a 737 production line at the Long Beach factory is strongly opposed by the Machinists union in Seattle , which represents about 39,000 Boeing workers .
But Figueira and other Douglas workers point out that they now work for Boeing , too , and if they can help the company , while at the same time saving a once-great aircraft factory and their jobs , what 's wrong with that ?
Two of the first five 737s brought here have already been finished and are on the flight line .
The work was supposed to have been done in 10 days .
It took seven .
After Boeing announced in May that it would transfer some 737 work to Long Beach and was considering a production line , the Douglas workers who were given special training on the 737 met to talk about how important it was to make a good impression on Boeing 's corporate office in Seattle .
`` They are putting their best foot forward and working just as hard as they can to get that production line , '' said Kedrick Legg , president of the local unit of the United Aerospace Workers , which represents about 8,000 Douglas workers .
`` We want to send a clear message to the corporation that this is a terrific and highly experienced work force down here .
In fact , our experience level is about twice what they have in Seattle .
Given some modern tooling , we could work wonders . ''
Aviation legend Donald W. Douglas would roll over in his grave if he knew the sorry state of the airplane company he founded in 1920 , and which merged in 1967 with McDonnell Aircraft Co. of St. Louis .
The merger never produced the great commercial aviation company that was supposed to challenge Boeing .
On a cold February morning in 1989 , after 20 years of poor financial performance by the Douglas Aircraft folks , John McDonnell , chief executive of the merged company and son of the founder , assembled more than 5,000 managers and executives at the Douglas plant in Long Beach and told them they had been stripped of their titles ; a new team work program called Total Quality Management System would be put into place .
Each manager would have to reapply for his or her job and take classes .
One Douglas executive who attended the classes but was told he didn n't measure up to the new way of doing business was James Douglas , also the son of a company founder .
It was not long before Douglas workers joked that Total Quality Management System stood for `` Time to Quit and Move to Seattle . ''
Now , perhaps , Seattle will come to them .
And none too soon .
After the merger last year , top Boeing executives were reportedly shocked to find out how much would be needed to upgrade the factory to Boeing standards .
`` We built the DC-8 the same way we are building planes today , and that was 30 years ago , '' Figueira said .
Legg , the UAW union local president , toured the Boeing plants in thePuget Sound area .
He was amazed at what he saw .
`` It was like stepping forward 30 years , '' he said .
`` All that new technology and high-speed tooling .
...
We have World War II tooling .
It 's like walking into a Henry Ford motor plant .
...
That 's why I always admired Boeing .
They were willing to spend the money and take chances . ''
In April , Figueira was among the first 87 Douglas workers who were trained on the 737 by Boeing supervisors from Seattle .
Figueira said he was surprised to learn that blueprints of the 737 could easily be examined on a computer .
Blueprints for Douglas planes are not yet computerized for floor workers to study .
`` If we had had Boeing 's engineering and tooling 10 or 15 years ago , I really don n't believe we would have had a merger , '' he said .
Instead , Douglas would have been a serious competitor .
Beverly O ' Neill , the mayor of Long Beach , and other California politicians are lobbying hard for Boeing to open the 737 line at the Douglas factory .
The California Trade and Commerce Agency has prepared a multimillion-dollar package of economic incentives to encourage Boeing to permanently shift some 737 work from Seattle to Long Beach .
McDonnell Douglas was Long Beach 's largest employer .
In 1989 , the work force totaled more than 40 , 000 .
Now , it 's less than half that , including the 8,000 Douglas workers who build the C-17 transport plane for the Air Force .
`` The MD line is slowly leaving , '' the mayor said in an interview Tuesday .
`` We are doing everything we can to maintain the strength we have currently .
We are doing everything we can to let Boeing know this is an outstanding work force and vitally important to our city . ''
