S. African Consumer Inflation Slightly Drops in
JOHANNESBURG , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- South Africa 's year-on-year consumer inflation slightly dropped to 9.0 percent in October from 9.1 percent in the previous month , Statistics South Africa said Thursday .
The Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) increased by 0.4 percent month on month .
The seasonally adjusted index also increased by 0.4 percent for the same period .
The annual increase of the CPI is mainly due to annual increases in the price indices for housing ( 3.8 percentage points ) , food ( 1,1 percentage points ) , medical care and health expenses ( 0,8 percentage points ) , household operation ( 0.7 percentage points ) and transport ( 0,7 percentage points ) .
The monthly increase of the CPI is due to monthly increases in the price indices for food , housing , household operation and personal care .
The annual core inflation rate , which excludes mortgage rates , volatile food items and value added tax , remained unchanged at 7.7 percent in October compared with the previous month .
The difference between the official inflation rate of 9,0 percent and the core inflation rate is mainly due to the impact of rising interest rates on existing mortgage bonds .
The core inflation rate is the South African Reserve Bank 's preferred indicator of underlying inflationary pressures .
