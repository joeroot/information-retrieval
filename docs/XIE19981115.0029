Scientists Claim Water Can Be Split by Stirring
LONDON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Japanese scientists have shaken the world of chemistry with an experiment showing water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature simply by adding a catalyst and stirring .
The discovery , made by Professor Kazunari Domen and colleagues at Tokyo Institute of Technology , seems a kind of heresy to most chemists , the New Scientist magazine said Saturday .
However , their results were carefully reviewed by other chemists before they were published in Chemical Communications , a learned journal of the British Royal Society of Chemistry .
The researchers have found that when they put a powdered cuprous oxide catalyst into a beaker of water at room temperature , and stirred it energetically , hydrogen and oxygen were given off .
Professor Domen initially thought that the energy driving the low-temperature reaction came from light , a mechanism chemists could just about live with .
But later he found that the reaction continues in the dark for hundreds of hours , suggesting that it was the stirring , not any energy from light , which helping the process .
The quicker the container is stirred , the more hydrogen and oxygen are produced , Professor Domen reported .
The researchers believed that the mechanical energy is converted to chemical energy without first being converted to thermal energy .
" This is the first example of mechanical energy being converted into chemical energy by catalysis , " Professor Domen said .
The researchers admitted that they don n't know how it works , saying that less than five per cent of the energy from stirring appears to end up splitting water , producing a small amount of hydrogen and oxygen gas .
But Professor Domen thought that he can improve the yield by learning more about how the reaction works .
" If we can increase the efficiency by an order of magnitude , then it may be possible to think about practical applications , " he said .
