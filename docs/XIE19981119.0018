Kabila Accuses S. Africa of Being Partial to
LUANDA , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Laurent Kabila , president of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , said here Wednesday that the ambiguous declarations issued by the South African government on the DRC issue is actually indication of its partiality to the Ugandan and Rwandan invaders .
Kabila made the remarks after concluding a three-hour brief visit to Angola .
The DRC needs support from South Africa , he said .
However , South Africa has been making appeals for the withdrawal of all foreign troops without distinguishing between invaders and defenders of national sovereignty .
According to Kabila , the military situation in his country is now stable , with the enemy forces besieged by government army and its allies .
He said his government is still willing to negotiate with Rwanda and Uganda , if they wish so , on the withdrawal of their forces from the DRC , and hear the explanations about their military presence in his country .
During his short visit , Kabila met with Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and exchanged views on situation in the DRC and Angola peace process .
The Tutsi-led rebels started an uprising in east Congo in early August against Kabila 's then 15-month-old government .
Ever since the fighting broke out , Kabila has been accusing Rwanda and Uganda of backing the rebels .
Angola , Namibia and Zimbabwe , on the other hand , had sent troops and offered other logistical support to help Kabila quell the rebellion , which now centered in the east part of the vast African country .
