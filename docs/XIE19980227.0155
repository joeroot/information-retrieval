Sri Lanka to Strengthen Implementation of Language
COLOMBO , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Sri Lankan government will designate officials and secretaries from ministries , departments , provincial councils and corporations to help implement the country 's language policy , The Observer newspaper reported Friday .
The paper quoted officials of the Public Administration Ministry as saying that the move was aimed at strengthening the implementation of the nation 's language policy .
The Constitution of Sri Lanka says everybody has the rights to communicate or do business with the government and receive replies and other documents either in Sinhala , Tamil or English .
However , due to various reasons , certain obstacles have hindered a smooth implementation of the country 's language policy , the paper said .
It listed a dearth of qualified staff , who are capable of working in two languages , and a lack of institutional facilities as the main obstacles .
It added that the Public Administration Ministry has instructed relevant authorities to take appropriate steps in accordance with the government decision .
