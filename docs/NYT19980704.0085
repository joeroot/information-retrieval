IN PADS OR ON PAR , FOLEY A FAN FAVORITE
( nk ) By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
A few thousand people got a recent preview of what life on the Jets could be like under Glenn Foley .
This didn n't happen in an exhibition game or on the practice field .
Instead , the scenario played out over the rolling Upper Montclair Country Club layout last week in Clifton , N.J . , where Foley attacked the greens playing in the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic .
After double-bogeying No. 12 , Foley was livid .
`` I attacked the course like I play quarterback , '' he said , `` and on the next hole I got a birdie . ''
What he did mirrored his go-for-it style , which has endeared him to fans on the football field .
On the dogleg-left 355-yard hole at Montclair , he cut the corner _ he drove the ball so that he would have a direct shot at the green .
He took the chance and it worked , rather than play safe .
Foley , tightly coiled , was still winding down half an hour after the tournament .
He walked the floor of the clubhouse , alternately sitting and standing .
His face was burnt from the sun , nearly disguising his freckles .
He would stop for a moment , talk about his play and then get up and walk some more .
Just days earlier , Coach Bill Parcells had virtually announced that Foley was the Jets ' new No. 1 quarterback .
Parcells said Foley has `` the benefit of the doubt . ''
In other words , it is his job over the newly hired Vinny Testaverde until proven otherwise .
Foley was mobbed at the golf tournament .
After every hole , people crowded around him as he walked to the next tee .
He stopped for dozens of autographs .
He enjoyed giving them , and he bantered with the crowd .
This was not Neil O ' Donnell 's forte .
`` Hey , you 've got the wrong green 4 , '' Foley said to one youngster , who was wearing a Green Bay Packers jersey with Brett Favre 's name and number on it .
When he sliced a shot to the right that landed in a patch of grass a dozen yards off the fairway , someone shouted , `` Heck of a touchdown pass , Glenn ! ''
The crowd was joking with him all the way .
`` Glenn , you 're going to lead us out , aren n't you ? ''
pleaded a fan , perhaps conscious that this is the 30th anniversary of the Jets ' Super Bowl moment .
Foley is a 3-handicap golfer and he did well in this event .
His 79 had him only three strokes behind the winner , the Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer .
Dilfer said : `` John Elway and I are the two best golfers among the quarterbacks .
Glenn ?
He 's coming along .
He 'll be good in another year or two . ''
& UR ; Following Rice 's Lead & LR ;
When Keyshawn Johnson was a senior at the University of Southern California , he made a list of what the great receivers had done in their first years in the National Football League .
Among the leaders was the 49 ers ' Jerry Rice .
`` Well , that 's a good idea , '' said Rice , when told of Johnson 's ledger .
`` Every young player should have a standard he aspires to . ''
Rice said he first met Johnson at USC .
`` I remember him being a talky kid , very confident , '' Rice said .
`` That 's good .
Everyone should have confidence .
But I think he 's calmed down a little now . ''
Johnson 's first two seasons have been close to Rice 's , in one respect : number of receptions .
Johnson has a total of 133 ; Rice had 135 .
Rice produced 18 touchdowns to Johnson 's 15 , and a gaudy 2,497 yards to Johnson 's 1 , 479 .
& UR ; ` Hey , Yearbooks Here ! ' & LR ;
When fans buy yearbooks at Jets games , they will find their newest heroes looking like those larger-than-life football players of the 1950s and 60s .
To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Super Bowl III , the publicity staff posed the players in those hokey stances _ a runner using a straight arm , and a defensive lineman poised to pounce at the camera .
