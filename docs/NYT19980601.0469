Southern Baptists , meeting in the land of the Latter-day Saints , will be asked to adopt a new denominational statement on marriage , children and the family .
If approved at the annual meeting in Salt Lake City June 11 - 13 , the statement will be added to the Baptist Faith and Message , a 35-year-old document stating what Southern Baptists believe .
The statement , which limits sexual expression to marriage between a man and a woman and encourages wives to be submissive to their husbands , was drafted by a seven-member committee that included the wives of two Baptist seminary presidents .
One of them , Dorothy Patterson , wife of Southeastern Seminary President Paige Patterson , is likely to be the first lady of the convention since her husband is expected to be elected its president .
`` I 'm very pleased at this time , when the family is under such an assault and attack from every quarter , that Southern Baptists have decided to go back to their biblical roots , determine what God says about the family , and include that in their statement to the word .
.
. ''
she told Associated Baptist Press , an independent news organization .
Her husband acknowledged in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the statement makes clear the convention 's stance against homosexuality .
`` In fact , in the definition of marriage given in the first sentence _ one man , one woman for life _ is probably the most significant thing in the statement , '' he said .
The Pattersons , who both have doctorates , have worked out the biblical relationship in their own home , Paige Patterson said .
`` Submission is that which the Bible plainly asks of a wife , '' he said .
`` If she elects to marry , then she is electing to be in submission to her husband .
Obviously this does not mean she is to submit if her husband asks her to violate the law of God .
If he comes home from work , gives her a gun and asks her to shoot the children , obviously she 's not supposed to do that .
It 's an attitude word more than anything .
It 's an understanding that God has assigned ultimate spiritual responsibility in the home to the man and given him a wife to assist him in that . ''
Dorothy Patterson `` could have run any corporation in America , '' her husband said .
`` She 's very gifted and very capable .
I 'd have to say that being in submission to her husband does not come naturally to Dorothy at all .
One reason I love her and respect her is that she holds this conviction .
Even though it 's not a natural thing to do for her , she has always in the spirit of the scripture , submitted . ''
The other woman on the committee is Mary Moiler , wife of Southern Baptist Seminary President Albert Moiler , a former editor of Georgia 's Baptist newspaper , The Christian Index .
She is a mother who does not work outside the home .
Critics say the statement is unrealistic .
`` The statement forgot Jesus and made June Cleaver a biblical model for motherhood , '' said Robert Parium , executive director of the Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville .
Parium also told Associated Baptist Press that Jesus spoke `` against the self-centered family '' and for the `` outwardly focused family . ''
In presenting the proposal to the Southern Baptist Convention next month , the committee will also present a commentary that `` will be a useful tool for those outside our faith who seek to comprehend Baptist beliefs , '' said committee Chairman Anthony Jordan , executive director of the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma .
The committee was appointed last year by Southern Baptist Convention President Tom Elliff .
