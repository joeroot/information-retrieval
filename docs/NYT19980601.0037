DECIDING ON DEATH OR LIFE FOR A KILLER
( bb ) By JOSEPH P. FRIED c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ One juror , an unemployed resident of Red Hook , Brooklyn , said that he believed the death penalty made criminals `` think twice before committing heinous crimes , '' but that he would not automatically vote to execute every killer , because it `` depends on how and why the murder was committed . ''
Another juror , a medical technician from Bedford-Stuyvesant said that her first husband had been killed in a 1981 shooting , but that her decision on whether to impose capital punishment in a murder case `` would depend on the evidence presented . ''
A third juror , an administrative assistant from Bensonhurst with a doctorate in English literature called her feelings about the death penalty `` sobering , '' saying the `` responsibility for someone 's life is an awesome one . ''
The three Brooklyn residents are among the 12 jurors who are expected this week to begin determining whether a former jail guard , Darrel K. Harris , will be the first person sentenced to death under the law that reinstated capital punishment in New York State three years ago .
Their statements came from questionnaires they filled out and in replies to questions by the judge and prosecution and defense lawyers during jury selection for Harris ' trial .
He was charged with killing three people during a 1996 robbery at an illegal social club in Bedford-Stuyvesant , and on May 19 the jury convicted him of first-degree murder .
Now the seven women and five men on the panel must perform the second task that the 1995 capital punishment law sets out for them : sentencing the 40-year-old Harris to death by lethal injection or to life in prison without parole .
The life sentence is an option if the jurors find it warranted by so-called mitigating factors , which can include positive aspects of Harris ' background and character , and his state of mind at the time he committed the killings .
A decade ago Harris was publicly honored as a hero for saving a fellow correction officer during an inmate riot at a Brooklyn jail .
In the trial 's penalty stage , which opened on Tuesday , his lawyers are offering this as one among several mitigating factors .
Others include an argument that Harris is a seriously disturbed man whose murderous explosion was fueled by stresses stemming from his upbringing and his former work as a jail guard , combined with drug and alcohol abuse .
His drug use ended his career with the city 's Correction Department in 1991 .
The mitigation testimony continues Monday before Acting Justice Anne Feldman , as arguments and testimony are also to begin in Poughkeepsie in the second death penalty trial under the 1995 law , that of Dalkeith V. McIntosh , charged with murdering his estranged wife and her daughter by a previous marriage .
And jury selection began last week for the third death penalty trial , and the second in Brooklyn _ that of Jermaine Page , who prosecutors contend murdered a man execution style after robbing him .

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
At Harris ' trial this week , after the defense finishes presenting witnesses _ who have included the jail guard Harris saved _ the jury will hear the prosecutors ' arguments that any mitigating factors do not offset what they have termed cold-blooded killings committed to eliminate witnesses to Harris ' robbery .
He shot two victims _ Michael Harris ( no relation ) and Jerome Sims _ in the head and fatally stabbed Evelyn Davis after running out of bullets .
The jurors who will assess all this , whose identities the court has kept confidential , range in age from the 30s to the 60s and include five people in health related jobs , four in office or blue collar employment , a science teacher , a retired woman and the unemployed man who last worked as a truck driver .
Five of the jurors have college degrees .
Racial influences on the jury that lawyers sometimes fear when the defendant and the victim are of different races , are not a factor in this case .
Harris is black , as were all his victims .
Eight of the jurors are black , three are white and one is Hispanic .
On their questionnaires , four of the jurors indicated a firm belief that some killings demand the death penalty , seven did not express vigorous feelings about capital punishment , one way or the other , and one , a medical technician from East Flatbush , simply said , `` It is the law in New York State . ''
But all said that they would assess the circumstances of the killings , as well as Harris himself , and would consider both life in prison without parole and the death penalty .
For example , a 35-year-old office worker from East New York said on her questionnaire that she favored capital punishment `` if a person willingly and knowingly plans to murder another person without any remorse whatsoever and for no reason . ''
But she also said that she would want to know the `` defendant 's state of mind at the time of the murder , the reason for the murder and did the defendant think of the consequence . ''
Similarly , a 49-year-old laboratory assistant from Bedford-Stuyvesant , who wrote `` open mind '' when asked her current feelings about the death penalty , also said that in deciding a sentence she would want to know `` the state of mind of the defendant at the time of the act . ''
The last execution in New York State was carried out in 1963 , in an electric chair .
In 1984 the state 's highest court , the Court of Appeals , declared the remaining provision of the state 's previous death penalty law unconstitutional .
