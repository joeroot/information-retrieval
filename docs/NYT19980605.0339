QUESTIONS REMAIN FOR PARCELLS AFTER ROOKIE WEEK

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ After looking closely at his 12 draft picks during rookie week , Jets coach Bill Parcells Friday sounded like a man who wasn n't sure about what he had bought .
Four of those picks are being asked to play positions that are different from their college roles .
The most noted is Scott Frost , the quarterback for co-champion Nebraska , who is trying to become a safety .
When he was selected in the third round , Frost thought he would play at free safety .
But at 6 feet 3 inches and 219 pounds , he would be uncommonly big for that position .
Instead , Frost was switched this week to strong safety , a position that would pit him often against tight ends , and support the defense against the run , rather than go head-to-head against swift receivers .
Frost , who played safety at Stanford before transferring to Nebraska , looked shaky the first few days when receivers slanted in front of him and repeatedly snared passes .
By Thursday , he began behaving more aggressively .
`` I 'm having trouble with one-on-one coverage , '' he said .
Frost is also concerned about his technique .
`` That , I have to learn more than anything , '' he said .
`` I know the kid can keep up mentally , '' Parcells said .
`` It 's just adjusting to technique .
And he 's going to be doing it over and over and over again .
`` If he makes it , '' Parcells said , `` the upside could be tremendous . ''
During rookie week , a former cornerback , Kevin Williams of Oklahoma State , has been the free safety .
He talks like one , too , describing himself as having the knack for the position .
As a senior , he picked off seven passes at cornerback .
`` When I 'm out there , '' he said , `` the ball just seems to find me . ''
While Victor Green is the incumbent at strong safety , the Jets are looking to replace Jerome Henderson at free safety .
He is going to compete at right cornerback .
The Jets also drafted Jason Fabini , a left tackle from Cincinnati , and are trying to make a right tackle out of him .
That spot was vacated by David Williams , who was cut last week .
Siupeli Malamala , a longtime backup , will be the man to beat out there .
Finally , Parcells drafted Casey Dailey of Northwestern , where he was a pass-rushing end .
Now he is a linebacker , although Parcells hopes he may be able to chase the quarterback in special situations .
`` I haven n't seen them in pads , '' Parcells said Friday as camp closed , and he won n't see them again until training camp opens July 22 .
In other words , the real evaluation still remains .
EXTRA POINTS
The Jets ' decision to play the Giants on grass in their annual exhibition game is a possible prelude to converting Giants Stadium from an artificial surface ...
The Jets cut linebacker Craig Guest , who had been on the practice squad last year .
They also dropped three players they had picked up in the off - season : defensive tackle Matt Keneley , wide receiver Bernard Holmes and punter Craig Deignan .
