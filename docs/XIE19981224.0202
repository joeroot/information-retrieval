Chinese Company Produces New Mobile Phone
HANGZHOU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The Hangzhou Oriental Telecommunications Co. Ltd. in this capital of Zhejiang Province has begun producing a new type of digital Chinese-version mobile phones , code-named EC528 .
The new product , which passed the second-generation European standard tests , is the first whose property rights are owned by China .
Hangzhou Oriental is China 's largest state-owned telecommunications enterprise and the only listed company representing this industrial sector .
Official figures indicate that China 's mobile telecommunications sector has been growing rapidly in recent years , with the scope of the market climbing to tens of billions of yuan a year .
However , this market is still dominated by foreign brands .
Hangzhou Oriental has accounted for about ten percent of China 's mobile phone and base station system equipment market since it first imported mobile-phone technology in 1990 .
It set up a development center in California 's Silicon Valley in the United States last year .
Official forecasts expect 15 million more mobile-phone users in China next year .
Hangzhou Oriental has said it will strive to develop more than 10 competitive models each year .
