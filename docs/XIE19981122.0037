Ruling Partner in Nepal Threatens to Quit Govt Again
KATHMANDU , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Communist Party of Nepal ( Marxism-Leninism , CPN-ML ) , the junior coalition partner , reiterated Sunday that it will pull out of the government if the agreements reached with its major partner were not implemented by the deadline .
Addressing an interaction program held in Kathmandu , CPN-ML General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam said that an ultimatum in this regard has been given to Prime Minister and Nepali Congress ( NC ) President Girija Prasad Koirala , Radio Nepal said .
He said that if the agreements which are in favor of the nation and people , are not enforced by December 1 , there is no meaning for his party to remain in the government .
The agreements the NC reached with the CPN-ML and other left parties cover a number of issues including law and order situation in the country , the withdrawal of Indian troops from Nepali land in Kalapani and reviewing the controversial 1950 Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty .
The CPN-ML has threatened to quit the government several times this month .
On November 17 , it issued a sternly-worded ultimatum , saying that it would withdraw from the government within 15 days if the agreements are not implemented .
The other left parties have announced a nation-wide agitation program against the government .
The major opposition Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxism-Leninism , CPN-UML ) , which has been pushing for early elections , has also announced a two-month protest program starting on November 27 to pressure the government for early , free and fair elections .
Prime Minister Koirala had said that he preferred April / May next year as the date for the elections , which should be held in November that year .
He ruled out the possibility of transferring Inspector-General of Police Achyut Krishna Kharel , a principal demand of the CPN-ML .
The CPN-ML joined hands with the NC in late August , turning the minority government of the NC into a coalition with a majority of seats in parliament .
With the support of the CPN-ML , the government succeeded in passing in parliament the budget and policies and programs for the 1998 / 99 fiscal year which begun in mid-July .
