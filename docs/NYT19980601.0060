LEAVE YOUR REGRETS IN MILWAUKEE AND HEAD FOR SPACE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By BILL TAMMEUS c.
1998 KANSAS CITY STAR
I am not looking for your sympathy when I reveal that several times in my life I have found myself in Milwaukee .
& QL ;
It is an occupational hazard for journalists .
Keep at this oddness long enough and eventually you find yourself in Milwaukee .
And sooner or later you will regret something about Milwaukee .
& QL ;
Perhaps the best time I ever had in Milwaukee was in 1976 when I was trailing around the late Sen. Eugene McCarthy , who was running for president again with no hope of winning but with too many good ideas to go to bed at night without having shared them with somebody who could vote .
& QL ;
We were in the kitchen of someone 's Milwaukee house for a fund-raiser , and McCarthy was regaling the crowd with spectacularly funny baseball stories from back when he played in the Sioux League or some such in Minnesota or wherever .
As you can tell , details of McCarthy 's baseball stories have become far too sketchy for me to recount here .
& QL ;
It turns out , by the way , that spending campaign time entertaining people in Milwaukee kitchens with hilarious baseball stories is no way to get to the White House .
Remember that if you long to be the most powerful human being in the world .
& QL ;
My regret about Milwaukee , however , has nothing to do with 1976 .
Rather , it has to do with 1998 .
That 's because I failed to be in Milwaukee recently for the International Space Development conference at which former astronaut Edwin `` Buzz '' Aldrin spoke about space tourism .
& QL ;
Mark this down : Space tourism is an idea whose time will come , and Buzz Aldrin 's promotion of the idea will be seen one day as the turning point .
& QL ;
Space tourism : Houston , we have an idea .
& QL ;
`` That 's my message to the astronauts , '' Aldrin said .
`` If they want to go to the moon or Mars , they better get behind ( space ) tourism . ''
It 's the only way , he said , to create `` a great consensus of people '' behind the nation 's space program .
& QL ;
I am almost immediately attached emotionally to the idea of vacationers taking off in rocket ships .
For one thing , imagine the cool message you could leave on your answering machine : & QL ;
`` Hi .
This is Bill .
I can n't come to the phone right now because I 'm traveling at 22,000 miles an hour on a spacecraft toward the planet Tralfamador in the X220PU Galaxy .
Leave a message at the beep .
Remember to tell me what year you called . ''
& QL ;
Tell me you wouldn n't love to be able to greet callers with that message .
& QL ;
Naturally , of course , there will be limited space ( what irony , eh ? ) available at first for space tourists .
At least until Southwest Airlines , say , buys NASA and starts selling $ 79 tickets to Pluto .
& QL ;
Aldrin 's answer the the space problem is to create a lottery system that would pick who gets to go .
& QL ;
Well , that might work , but if it were up to me I think I 'd decide on the basis of an essay contest .
I don n't mean that people would write the essays saying why they want to go .
Rather , I 'd have others write essays telling why they wanted to get rid of someone by sending him or her into space .
& QL ;
In essence , we 'd be searching for the country 's most annoying people and then unloading them into the cosmos .
& QL ;
You may wonder why I was imagining my own answering machine message if the idea is to find the most annoying people .
Surely , you 're thinking , I don n't count myself among the most annoying .
No , but if I continue to devote the first third of my columns on something else to Milwaukee , you may .
