Japan 's LDP , LP Reach Agreement on Coalition
TOKYO , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and the opposition Liberal Party ( LP ) Thursday agreed to form a coalition government by the next regular Diet ( parliament ) session in January .
The agreement was reached between Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi , head of the LDP , and LP leader Ichiro Ozawa .
It marks the end of the rivalry between the two parties that started when Ozawa split from the LDP with a group of legislators in June 1993 .
The two parties will jointly draw up a state budget for the 1999 fiscal year by the end of this year , the agreement said .
The Liberals will cooperate fully with the LDP from outside the cabinet during the extraordinary Diet session , which will convene on November 27 , it said .
The two parties will cooperate in national as well as local elections , the agreement said .
The two parties will also coordinate policies on security issues , education , administrative reform and welfare .
Obuchi said after signing the agreement that he was " very happy " with the alliance , and felt confident that various policies will be implemented " with the firm cooperation of the parties " .
Obuchi had been seeking a stronger power base for the LDP , which holds a thin majority in the lower house , but lacks overall control of the House of Councillors , or the upper house .
The LDP , which has 104 upper house seats , will still be short of a majority even after forming a coalition with the LP , which has 12 seats .
