In politics , as in science , pundits are always on the lookout for a unified theory , preferably a single idea that binds together an otherwise disparate constellation of facts and events .
For the seemingly endless stream of revelations that constitutes America 's campaign finance scandal , no explanation is as seductively simple _ or sinister _ as the China plot .
It has all the elements of a Manchurian Candidate remake : The mink-coat-wearing daughter of the top Chinese general .
A frantic search for satellite technology and missile guidance systems .
Intercepted communications that suggest a Beijing-directed scheme to suborn American politicians .
And lurking behind the scenes , the People 's Liberation Army , a one-time peasant force that some see as the American military 's one potential peer in the coming century .
Look through the eyes of those who follow China most closely , however , and the best of those plot lines falls flat .
`` I was a skeptic from the beginning and I remain a skeptic , '' says James Mulvenon of the Rand Corp. in California , a specialist on the Chinese military and its commercial ventures .
`` When you have a sense of how China works , it is hard to see these scandals as anything but an unfortunate series of coincidences , not a plot . ''
That view is shared by many American scholars and diplomats who focus on China .
Many say they are wary of appearing to apologize for China 's military , which has a staunch anti-American faction and a long history of activities that promote arms proliferation .
None suggests that involvement in American politics by Chinese people with ties to government-run businesses is either legal or proper .
And few would rule out the possibility that some element of the military has commercial ambitions that ties to President Clinton might help advance .
But they question some of the received wisdom in Congress and the media that underlie the plot theory : that China 's military is a monolith ; that the army has wealth and discipline to match its size , and that China 's military , foreign ministry , defense industry , intelligence gatherers and Cabinet can be assumed to act with anti-American singlemindedness .
Chas Freeman , a longtime American diplomat and China watcher , argues that plot-seekers usually ignore the complexities of the Chinese system .
`` Unless and until there is something more concrete linking these different stories , I can not accept that there is a plot , '' he said .
`` This scandal is about us , not about them . ''
Still , several of the main players in the drama are Chinese .
One of the most prominent foreigners to have sought audiences with Clinton during the last election was Liu Chaoying , an aerospace company executive and child of the Chinese army 's most senior general , Liu Huaqing .
Mrs. Liu was reported to have given money to the Democratic National Committee through a Taiwanese-American fund-raiser , Johnny Chung .
The People 's Liberation Army also has a vested interest in launching more foreign satellites and , of course , in acquiring American missile technology .
But the task of connecting those strands of information is complicated by the fact that China 's military , though it remains opaque and wary of outsiders , does not follow the totalitarian model , at least when the model suggests unity and discipline of the first order .
In fact , the army is closely watched these days for the high command 's attempts to steel the ranks against an insidious foreign force : capitalism .
In the early 1980s , a time of budget cutting , the late patriarch Deng Xiaoping pushed military units to support themselves by doing business , and by the end of last year the army could claim some 10,000 business enterprises within its domain , according to Jane 's Defense Weekly , an industry journal .
They make phones and cars , operate cruise ships and hotels , and own companies with listings on domestic and foreign stock exchanges .
They also produce armaments , but some estimates put their arms-related manufacturing business at a small fraction of the total .
The military 's vast commercial side sometimes supports national defense , but not always .
Central military authorities have struggled to get officers to focus less on money making and more on military preparedness .
And one expert on the Chinese military , Tai Ming Cheung in Hong Kong , says the bulk of money earned by military companies is invested in new businesses , or used to buy luxury goods for senior officers , or laundered overseas .
Even further removed from the army 's direct control are defense contractors , including the China Aerospace Corporation , the parent of Mrs. Liu 's company .
It reports to the government 's Cabinet , not to the generals , and is considered a commercial enterprise , albeit with some military manufacturing duties .
It has a subsidiary that has issued shares publicly , and that company is Mrs. Liu 's direct employer , China Aerospace International .
It has its headquarters and its stock listing in Hong Kong , making it subject to the former British colony 's corporate disclosure rules .
Its business line includes telecommunications , auto parts and real estate , but not military manufacturing .
Further complicating the picture is the fact that the companies rarely draw sharp lines between military and commercial businesses .
China Aerospace , for example , controls Great Wall Industries , which manages China 's Long March commercial rockets and solicits launch business from foreign satellite companies .
Long March technology overlaps that of China 's nuclear-tipped missiles .
But China Aerospace and its subsidiary are also developing a separate and purely commercial television satellite business to serve Chinese homes .
Those degrees of separation make it even harder to piece together why Mrs. Chaoying might have forayed into American politics .
Was she working on behalf of Great Wall Industries and the Long March rocket , or China Aerospace 's satellite plan , or its auto parts , or none of the above ?
No one knows for sure , says Mulvenon of Rand .
He also said it would not be unusual for such a person to seek contacts or publicity in America for an entirely separate reason , like a personal venture .
He considers highly unlikely one other scenario _ that she was working on behalf of her father , the now retired chief of the army , to acquire American military technology .
Or that she was on a mission to persuade President Clinton to relax export controls on dual-use , civilian-military goods .
`` One thing you can say with some certainty is that China is not run like Iraq , and Liu Huaqing is not Saddam , relying on his own children for sensitive missions , '' Mulvenon said .
`` China is much more institutionalized , not a capricious tin-pot dictatorship . ''
He said the ministry of state security would jealously guard its right to manage an espionage mission , and the Foreign Ministry would be unlikely to charge an aerospace company executive with an important diplomatic duty , even if the executive had a high rank by birth .
None of that disproves a plot by the Chinese military , these experts say .
But it raises the bar a notch for those who seek to show that one exists .
