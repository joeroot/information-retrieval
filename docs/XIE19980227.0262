Ancient Hong Kong Residents Liked to Pull Teeth
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- People living in Hong Kong some 4,000 years ago had a propensity for pulling teeth , according to an archeological find .
Last summer , Chinese archeologists unearthed 20 tombs dating back to the Late Stone Age .
The find has just been selected as one of China 's top 10 archeological finds in 1997 by leading archeologists here .
According to the experts , a great number of people lived on the coast of Hong Kong some 4,000 years ago .
From the skeletons remaining in 15 tombs , the experts deduced that the locals were short in stature , had a wide mouth and had a custom of pulling at least one tooth .
" Why the people had such a custom is yet to be researched , " archeologists said .
The experts value the excavation also because it was the first conducted in Hong Kong since it was returned to the motherland and that it was the largest ever conducted there .
The other nine top archeological finds last year were : a cave in the Qinling Mountains with some 35,000 pieces of stoneware dating back some 360,000 years , well-preserved building remains from 7,700 years ago found in Shandong Province , a more than 5,000-year-old shell mound site in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region , the world 's oldest paddy field found in Hunan Province , an earlier city site among the remains of a city of the Shang Dynasty ( 16th - 11th Century B.C. ) , a storage of bronzeware from 2,500 years ago in Henan Province , the site of an imperial summer resort of the Qin Dynasty ( 221 - 206 B.C. ) , a ducal stone structure from 2,000 years ago in Guangzhou city , and a nearly 2,000-year-old tomb site on the route of the Ancient Silk Road .
