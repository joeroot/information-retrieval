Security Council Discusses U.N. Role in Angola
UNITED NATIONS , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday put the issue of Angola on the agenda in a bid to see what role the world body is going to play in the war-torn southwest African country .
The Security Council decided to take up the Angolan issue after its closed-door consultations on Iraq , U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said .
The decision came as fresh fighting was raging on in the country , killing 26 people and wounding two dozen others in central Angola .
" There is a war , " U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on December 14 , referring to the rapidly escalating bloodshed in this battle-scarred country .
Against such a backdrop , Annan woundered aloud whether the U.N. efforts to foster peace had come to an unsuccessful end .
" The ( Security ) Council soon will be obliged to decide whether the U.N. has a role or not , " he said .
Annan made the grim assessment after months of gradually escalating fighting between the Angolan government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , the two sides that have been at war for most of the part 23 years since the nation 's independence .
The two sides signed a much-vaunted peace accord in 1994 , but UNITA violated its terms by rearming its forces and retaking territory it had ceded to government control .
The rebel group financed its operations by mining and illicit marketing of diamonds , despite several international trade and arms embargoes against the rebels , reports said .
Since the start of the government 's offensive in early December the fighting has centered on Bie province where UNITA has its key bases in the towns of Bailundo and Andulo .
