He made the remarks when commenting an annual survey of corporate leadership by the Far Eastern Economic Review .
This year , Thai companies had been busy trimming , regrouping and recapitalizing , finding foreign partners or simply selling costly baggage to ride out the economic downturn , according to the review .

Thai Farmers Bank is ranked second and Bangkok Bank third in the country .
Both of them are in the process of massive , government-prompted recapitalization .
Thai Airways International and The Nation Multimedia Group are the two new companies which enter the top 10 , with the former taking the ninth place and the latter the tenth .
In five leadership categories , Dusit Thani stayed first for the sixth consecutive year for high-quality services and products .
