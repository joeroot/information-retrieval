Jordan Warns of More Syrian Ditches Along Yarmuk
AMMAN , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Jordan has warned that it will have less water from the Yarmuk River because Syria in the upper reaches have built many ditches along the river 's tributaries .
The warning was issued by Jordanian Minister of Water and Irrigation Hani Malki after a regular cabinet session on Saturday , Sunday 's semi-official Jordan Times reported .
Even now , Jordan can not get its full water share from the river , as Syria has built more than 30 ditches and pumping facilities along its tributaries to store water , said Malki .
Mainly because of Syria 's construction of ditches , the annual flow of the Yarmuk River has decreased to 270 million cubic meters when it runs into Jordan from 470 cubic meters years ago when it runs into Jordan , said the minister .
Malki made these remarks as the two countries are holding a joint meeting in Amman on sharing the water of the river , which mainly feeds Jordan , Syria and Israel .
Jordan expects to get a dam project approved by the Syrian side during the two-day meeting from Saturday to Sunday .
The dam aims to store water from the river for Jordan .
In 1955 , an Arab League committee on water set Jordan 's annual share of the river 's water at 330 million cubic meters and 90 million for Syria .
Syria currently gets 220 million cubic meters of water from the river each year .
