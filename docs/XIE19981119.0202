Zambia to Impose Fishing Ban from December
LUSAKA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Zambia 's Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Fisheries will next month close all major rivers for three months from commercial fishing to enable fish to breed , a fisheries official has said .
The move is to enable fish to eat more , breed and grow quickly in the period from December to next February , Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted Fred Kafumbe , provincial fisheries official from northern Luanpula Province , as saying .
Some rivers such as Kafue , Bangweulu and Lower Zambezi will close from December 1 , this year .
Kafumbe said Wednesday that in this period , fish can receive much food in form of organic matter from land surfaces which nutrients are dragged by running water into rivers and lakes .
He said that fishing areas bordering other countries will remain open except for one along the Zambia-Congo ( K ) border , where an agreement has been signed between the two governments to close the fisheries at this time .
The fishing areas that will remain open are Lusiwasi in Serenje of Lower Luangwa , and Lake Kariba which is shared with Zimbabwe .
Kafumbe said that even in these areas , fishermen would be advised to obtain certificates of origin of fish before being allowed to sell their catch .
And those who import fish from abroad would be requested to get necessary papers from Zambian customs and health offices before they are granted permission to sell .
