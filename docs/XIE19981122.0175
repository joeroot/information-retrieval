British Detectives Investigate Venables Transfers
LONDON , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Fraud squad detectives are investigating the transfers of a number of Australian players to Portsmouth Football Club while it was under the control of the former England manager Terry Venables .
The Independent reported on Saturday that police in the southern English county of Hampshire are examining allegations of " bad business practice " involving the purchase of players last year .
The report said five players are believed to be involved .
They include Robert Enes from Sydney United , Hamilton Thorpe from Western Adelaide , Craig Foster from Fairfield Marconi and Australian John Aloisi , who joined from the Italian club Cremonesi .
All four joined Portsmouth in 1997 .
Venables , who bought Portsmouth in August 1996 when the club was in crisis , has declined to comment .
His spokesman said " He is not aware of any situation requiring any investigation in any event . "
News of the Portsmouth inquiry follows the decision taken on Tuesday by English first division club Crystal Palace , where Venables is now coach , to ask the Football Association to investigate a shortfall in the payment for the transfer of two Chinese internationals .
Palace paid 1.35 million pounds ( about 2.27 million U.S. dollars ) in August for Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai .
But the Chinese football association is reported to expect 900,000 pounds ( 1.51 million U.S.dollars ) .
Venables has said he played no part in the Chinese transfers .
Palace said Friday it was " committed to the highest standards of corporate governance " .
Portsmouth Football Club declined to comment on the police inquiry .
