BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The China Construction Bank ( CCB ) introduced computerized account transferral remittance services in 138 Chinese cities beginning Wednesday .
The " individual electronic remittance " services are available on CCB 's nationwide computer network and operating systems .

The payee can withdraw the funds from the nearest CCB branch in 24 hours .
Charges for the new service are relatively low when compared with traditional remittance services .

The bank plans to expand the service to a number of other cities , as well as developed counties and towns , according to a CCB spokesman .
Experts noted that the sharp increase in economic activities and increasing mobility of Chinese citizens have caused the nation 's remittance volume to surge from 52 billion yuan in 1991 to 300 billion yuan in 1997 , up 35 percent on an annual basis .
The figure is expected to reach 450 billion yuan by 2000 .
