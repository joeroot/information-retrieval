UN Relief Workers Return to Baghdad
BAGHDAD , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Fifty-eight U.N. humanitarian workers who evacuated during the Iraq crisis on weapons inspection returned to Baghdad Thursday after the tension was eased .
Aric Falt , a spokesman for U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Iraq , said the staff will resume their normal activities on Sunday .
The 58 U.N. humanitarian staff left Baghdad a week ago as a precaution against a possible U.S. military attack on Iraq .
The crisis was triggered when Iraq refused to open some sensitive sites like presidential palaces to U.N. weapons inspectors .
But U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan defused the crisis by striking a deal with Iraq Monday that would give U.N. arms inspectors unconditional and unrestricted access to Iraqi presidential sites .
