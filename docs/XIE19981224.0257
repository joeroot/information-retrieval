S. Africa Slams Israeli Attack on Lebanon
JOHANNESBURG , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- South Africa has condemned Israel 's air strike on Lebanon Tuesday , saying that such act endangered lives of innocent civilians and would perpetuate the cycle of violence in the Middle East .
In a statement released Wednesday , the South African Foreign Ministry called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government to stop air raids against population centers in Lebanon , South African Press Association reported Thursday .
South Africa called on Israel to honor the spirit of peace-making in the Middle East which was recently reinforced with the signing of the Wye River memorandum , said the statement .
The Israeli air force attacked the Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon Tuesday , killing seven civilians .
South Africa regarded the attack as yet another in a litany of such incidents , including the inexcusable massacre of more than one hundred Lebanese civilians at Qana in 1996 , said the statement .
Similar attacks in recent years have led to the deaths of large numbers of innocent civilians in Lebanon , it added .
The ministry voiced its concern that violence might escalate as Hizbollah in Lebanon has indicated that it intends to take its revenge .
" This will once again perpetuate the cycle of violence in the region and lead to further hostility in southern Lebanon and on the northern border of Israel , " it said .
