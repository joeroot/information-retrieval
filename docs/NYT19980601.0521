( For use by clients of the New York Times News Service ) From Accounting to Faxing , Software Can Do It All for You By David Einstein c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle Personal computers can n't run your small business for you .
But they can make it a heck of a lot easier .
With the right software , you can accomplish just about any task , from managing your finances to designing a company newsletter to creating a Web site .
It can save you time and money and put you in control of your business in a way never before possible .
Following is a rundown of software that benefits almost any small business , along with examples of the most popular programs available .
In each case , the price given is for one copy of the program designed for a computer running Windows 95 , and , in some cases , Windows NT .
Many of the programs also are available for the Macintosh .
If you need more than one copy of a program , check with the manufacturer .
Many companies offer a discount on multiple copies .
Office Suites
No matter what kind of business you run , you are going to need a good word processor , a spreadsheet program for crunching numbers and probably a database for tracking customers and / or inventory .
Fortunately , you can get all these together in what 's known as an office suite .
The top-selling suite , not surprisingly , is Microsoft Office .
It comes in a Professional Edition and a Small Business Edition .
The Professional Edition includes Word and Excel , the most popular word processor and spreadsheet , as well as Access , a powerful database , and Outlook , a personal information manager .
The suite goes for $ 530 .
The Small Business Edition , priced at $ 470 , lacks the database but includes the Microsoft Publisher desktop publishing program and Expedia Streets , a program that locates addresses and puts them on a map .
Other choices are SmartSuite from Lotus and WordPerfect 8 Suite Professional from Corel .
SmartSuite includes a word processor , spreadsheet , database and personal information manager , and lists for $ 400 .
Corel 's suite , which doesn n't have a database , costs $ 302 .
You can mix components from different suites , but there is little point to this .
For one thing , it will cost you a lot more to get individual programs than you will pay for a complete suite ( Microsoft Access lists for $ 300 when bought separately . ) And programs from one company are not designed for tight integration with those from another .
Desktop Publishing
No software can save your business as much time and money as a desktop publishing program .
You can design your own newsletters , brochures , business cards and fliers .
In many cases , the materials you can produce on a good office printer will rival the results you would get from an outside print shop .
Microsoft Publisher , mentioned earlier , which sells for under $ 100 by itself , is easily the best publishing program in its class .
And for all but the most ambitious jobs , it is every bit as good as high-end programs used by professional publishers .
If you want to produce highly sophisticated material , such as a book , guide or manual , consider purchasing one of the big boys _ Adobe PageMaker ( $ 550 ) or QuarkXPress ( about $ 600 ) .
Each can handle full-color publications of any length .
But bear in mind that they are pretty complicated programs , and are not nearly as easy to use as Publisher .
Accounting
Why hire an accountant when you can get accounting software that will do the same thing for a lot less money ?
Two of the best programs are QuickBooks from Intuit ( $ 100 ) and Peachtree Accounting from Peachtree Software ( $ 120 ) .
Either can handle payrolls , invoices , time sheets , accounts payable and receivable _ in short , most accounting tasks .
The programs do all the math for you , and even let you analyze your financial picture .
And the numbers they generate can be put into popular tax programs , saving you lots of time come next April .
QuickBooks and Peachtree Accounting have ready-to-use forms for most financial procedures .
But you might also consider a specialized forms program such as Formtool Express from IMSI ( $ 40 ) .
It offers 250 forms that you can customize for your own business .
Another program , OmniForm from Caere ( $ 146 ) , lets you use a scanner to turn paper forms into electronic ones .
Faxing
Almost every business these days conducts a lot of its communications via the fax machine .
With fax software , you can use your PC to send and receive faxes .
This can be a time-saver , especially if your fax machine is constantly busy .
The top-ranked fax software for some time has been WinFax from Symantec , which sells for $ 90 .
It 's easy to use and gives you all kinds of options for cover pages .
You can set it to automatically answer the phone and receive incoming faxes .
Virus Fighters
What could be worse than your business grinding to a halt because a virus has laid your computer low ?
While the chance of contracting a virus is slim , it never hurts to protect yourself with a program that can detect all the latest computer bugs and electronically squash them .
Either Norton Anti-Virus or McAfee VirusScan will do the job .
Both of these $ 45 programs can be set to scan your system for viruses each time you turn on your computer .
Creating a Web Site
More and more small businesses are climbing onto the Internet , which is becoming a great way to reach potential customers .
To market your business on the Internet , you 'll have to create a Web site .
You can have this done professionally , but you can also create one yourself using the latest Web-authoring tools .
Three easy-to-learn and use programs are Microsoft FrontPage 98 ( $ 139.95 ) , Adobe PageMill ( $ 99 ) and Claris Home Page ( $ 99.95 ) .
Shareware
In addition to software available in retail stores , consider downloading some first-rate shareware programs to round out your arsenal .
WinZip , from Nico Mak Computing , makes it a snap to compress and decompress files .
Compressed files take up less storage space , and take less time to send as e-mail attachments .
A must-have for anyone who deals with graphics is Paint Shop Pro from Jasc Software .
At $ 99 , it is not the cheapest piece of shareware , but it is one of the best .
You can convert graphics from one format to another , resize them and adjust their color .
Both programs are available for downloading through & LR ; www.hotfiles.com & LR ; or & LR ; www.shareware.com .
