" Cultural Revolution " Items Draw Public Attention ( 1 )
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- An oil painting about Mao Zedong has been given the title of " national first class cultural relic " , which has drawn wide attention to items connected with the " cultural revolution " ( 1966 - 1977 ) .
The painting , " Chairman Mao on His Way to Anyuan " , depicting Mao Zedong in the early 1930s on his way to do revolutionary work at a coal mine in east China 's Jiangxi Province , was one of the most popular oil paintings during that period .
More than 900 million copies of the painting were made and distributed all over the country .
The painting was also included in school textbooks .
An official from the State Cultural Relics Bureau told Xinhua today that relics of the " cultural revolution " , such as badges , paintings and the " little red book " of quotations from Mao , are also part of the country 's historic heritage , are of educational significance and should not be lost to history .
According to the National Committee for Cultural Relics Authentication And Preservation , this is the first time the committee has pronounced an object produced after New China was founded in 1949 to be a cultural relic .
Liu Chunhua , head of the Beijing Painting Studio , has claimed to be the sole executor of the oil painting .
However , his former colleagues have claimed that the painting was collectively created .
The painting was first housed in the Museum of the Chinese Revolution here , and then kept by Liu for 15 years .
Two years ago , the painting was sold to the Construction Bank of China at a price of 5.5 million yuan ( 660,000 US dollars ) at an auction .
" When I took the painting from the museum and during the 15 years when I kept it nobody told me it was a cultural relic , " said Liu .
