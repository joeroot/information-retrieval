Swaziland 's Fiscal Position Deteriorating :
JOHANNESBURG , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Swaziland Finance Minister Themba Masuku on Thursday warned that the country 's fiscal position was deteriorating and was projected to worsen in the medium term .
Presenting the estimates for the 1998 / 99 financial year during his budget speech to parliament , Masuku said the appropriated deficit was about 192.2 million Rand ( 38.4 million U.S. dollars ) , which was 4.2 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
South African Press Association ( SAPA ) quoted Masuku as saying that in view of an urgent need for sustainable growth in the economy , his proposed budget was expansionary in order to address infrastructure problems , worsening crime and poverty alleviation .
Masuku referred to political , economic and social reform projects started during the 1996 / 97 financial year which still needed govenment funding .
Masuku pointed out that economic growth depended on creating an environment conducive to foreign and domestic investment .
" To this end a Swaziland investment promotion agency is to be established shortly to streamline and improve procedures for starting businesses in the kingdom and to promote Swaziland internationally as a stable haven for investment , " he said .
Masuku also warned that strikes , which last year badly affected mainly the agricultural sector and education , had far reaching implications which scared away investors .
This also increased already high levels of unemployment and lowered the standard of living for all .
Referring to population issues , Masuku said while Swaziland 's population declined to 2.7 percent , it still needed to be reduced to avoid outstripping the economic growth rate .
