Cytologist Wins " America 's Nobel Prize "
LOS ANGELES , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- A cytologist and genetics professor from Seattle has received one of the most prestigious awards in medical research for his studies on the nature of cell division , the Seattle Times reported today .
Lee Hartwell , director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and professor of genetics at the University of Washington , shared with two other scientists the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award , often called " America 's Nobel Prize . "
The scientists discovered the universal mechanism that controls cell division in organisms that have a nucleus .
The process is basic to understanding how cells mutate to become cancerous and to developing ways to prevent and treat cancer .
Hartwell , 58 , focused his research on yeast and discovered many of the genes essential to its step-to-step development .
He discovered important " checkpoint genes " that are responsible for correcting errors in DNA as cell division occurs .
Learning when and how the cell cycle derails is the centerpiece of his work .
The Seattle Times quoted Lasker Award officials as saying that Hartwell 's work has contributed greatly to the understanding of cell growth .
Many of the genes he identified may be common to plants and animals .
He is now helping direct research on drugs that interact with the cell cycle .
Sharing the award are Yoshio Masui , professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Toronto , and Paul Nurse , director-general of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London .
The Lasker Awards focus keen attention each year on an elite list of remarkable contributions to basic and clinical medical research whose work has been seminal and far-reaching .
Since 1945 , 300 awards have been given to celebrated scientists and physicians .
Among their achievements are the discovery of the centrality of DNA as a genetic principle , the development of a polio vaccine , and determination of the structure of the double helix , and identification of HIV as the cause of AIDS .
Many winners of the awards have gone on to win the Nobel Prize in medicine or chemistry .
