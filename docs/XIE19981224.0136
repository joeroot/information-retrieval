Vegetable Oil Consumption Demand Grows Steadily in China
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Economists predict that China 's demand for vegetable oil will continue to grow next year , indicating a further increase in imports .
Demand is slated to reach 11.69 million tons next year , while the country 's output is expected to drop to 7.38 million tons , leaving a shortfall of 4.31 million tons to be met by imports .
With the improvement of people 's living standards , the consumption of vegetable oil in China has grown steadily since 1992 , and the figure hit 11.3 million tons last year , up 5.55 million tons over 1992 .
However , there is a widening gap between vegetable oil demand and supply in the domestic market .
Although output of vegetable oil increased 2.65 million tons over the past five years , it still can not meet half of the domestic consumer demand .
China is now one of the world 's largest vegetable oil importers and its import is mainly focused on soya-bean oil , palm oil and rapeseed oil in a proportion of 50 percent , 37.5 percent and 10 percent , respectively .
