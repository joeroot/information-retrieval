U.N. Arms Inspection Goes Smoothly
BAGHDAD , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. weapons inspection went on smoothly on Wednesday , the first day that U.N. arms inspectors resumed work after returning to Iraq on Tuesday , said an Iraqi official .
The Iraqi News Agency INA quoted Hussam Mohammed Ameen , director of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate , the Iraqi liaison with U.N. arms inspectors , as saying that the Iraqi side provided all the facilities for U.N. arms inspectors .
Ameen said two missile teams from the U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center visited some sites to make sure that surveillance equipments there were working properly .
A chemical team visited a factory outside Baghdad to check whether sealing paper stuck on some machines were removed or not , said Ameen .
Three inspection teams of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in charge of overseeing Iraq 's nuclear program visited some sites in or outside Baghdad , said Ameen , adding that a biological team inspected one site .
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 's special envoy to Iraq , Prakash Shah , left Baghdad for Bahrain on Wednesday , said Ameen , but he did not mention the purpose of Shah 's trip .
Earlier in the day , Shah told reporters that Iraq 's pledges of full and unconditional cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors would be tested in the coming days , especially when intrusive and surprise inspections to new sites were resumed .
Sources close to the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq ( UNSCOM ) told Xinhua Wednesday on condition of anonymity that intrusive inspections of new suspected sites may have to wait until next week .
Eighty-six U.N. arms inspectors returned to Baghdad Tuesday after an imminent U.S. military strike against Iraq had been averted .
Wednesday is the first day that U.N. arms inspectors resume their work since last August when Iraq barred UNSCOM and IAEA from conducting intrusive inspections of new sites .
U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler last Wednesday ordered the withdrawal of about 100 personnel from Iraq on the " strong recommendation " from the U.S. government which said a military strike against Iraq was imminent .
Iraq averted possible U.S. and British air strikes at the last minute on Saturday by agreeing to allow the resumption of U.N. arms inspections unconditionally .
Iraqi leadership halted all forms of cooperation with UNSCOM on October 31 , including its monitoring activities , while allowing IAEA to proceed with its monitoring activities .
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and UNSCOM for attempting to prolong U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
The crippling U.N. sanctions can not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction .
