JOHANNESBURG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Lesotho 's ruling party , Lesotho Congress for Democracy ( LCD ) , was still in power and governing the country with Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili at its helm , Mosisili 's deputy Kelebone Maope said Monday .
Reports that Mosisili and senior cabinet ministers had fled the country were false , South African Press Association ( SAPA ) quoted Maope as saying in a telephone interview .
" The prime minister is still here in Maseru .
The government has not been unseated . "
Maope said the government was still willing to hold talks with opposition parties , despite their boycott of a meeting earlier Monday .
The LCD government was the legitimate government of Lesotho and had appealed to the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) for assistance , Maope added .
Asked whether this would include a SADC peacekeeping force in view of the fact that elements of the Lesotho Defense Force were no longer loyal to the government , he said : " I don n't know . "
South Africa 's The Star newspaper reported Monday morning that there was a coup in Lesotho and that opposition parties had overthrown the Mosisili government .
It also reported that Mosisili and several senior cabinet ministers had fled the country .
Lesotho 's opposition parties Monday denied the newspaper report .
