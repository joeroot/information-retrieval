Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to Dissidents in China ( 2 )
In my opinion , however , democracy , freedom and human rights are nothing but slogans used in political struggles .
There is neither true and absolute freedom and democracy in the world nor freedom and democracy for everyone .
In fact , all political powers in the world obtain their power by claiming that they will seek democratic rights and freedom for the people .
But in the first years after the founding of the political power , it usually fails to provide freedom and democracy for its people .
Only when it has been consolidated will this political power make gradual efforts to expand democracy and freedom .
Naturally , it will turn back and confine the people 's democracy and freedom when in a crisis .
The situation is the same all over the world , and I hereby take the United States as an example .
When the United States was founded in 1776 , it had a population of only about three million , and one-fifth of them were slaves with no freedom at all .
Only 31 years later , in 1807 , did the U.S. Congress pass a law forbidding the trade in Negro slaves .
But the black people had to wait for another 100 years and more before they were granted the right to vote .
And American women didn n't acquire their right to participate in elections until as late as 1920 , 144 years after the founding of the United States .
