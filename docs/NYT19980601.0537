LABOR POURS MILLIONS INTO EFFORT TO DEFEAT INITIATIVE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By LYNDA GOROV c.1998 The Boston Globe
UNIVERSAL CITY , Calif. _ Facing a roomful of union firefighters , Mark Bucher admitted he had not expected a warm welcome , and he did not get one .
Not a single person applauded his introduction .
The applause after his remarks was civil at best .
Then a firefighter stood to rebut Bucher and won a standing ovation .
As one of the authors of the `` paycheck protection '' initiative , which would require unions to get permission from each member before spending that member 's dues on politics , Bucher has become an enemy of organized labor throughout California .
Opponents claim the measure 's backers want to silence working people and tilt campaign financing in conservatives ' favor .
At first , voters seemed not to care .
Only a few months ago , polls showed strong support among even union households .
But that was before labor poured millions of dollars into its `` Vote No '' campaign and staged a comeback that has surprised even some union activists .
As voters prepare to go to the polls Tuesday , Proposition 226 , as the measure is formally known , is the one clear toss-up on a ballot that includes the governorship and an initiative to end bilingual education .
The latest numbers from the San Francisco-based Field Poll show 47 percent of all voters opposing Prop 226 and 45 percent supporting it .
Voters who are in unions or who live with union members now oppose it 2 1 / 2 - 1.
`` It 's woken up all working people , woken up a sleeping giant , '' said Michael Murray , a Los Angeles firefighter and vice president of his union local .
`` People are listening to labor again . ''
Union and political leaders will be listening to what Californians say in the election , too .
Both sides say the outcome could cause a chain reaction in other states .
The measure 's opponents say passage would sideline unions politically and cut deep into Democratic coffers overall , since the bulk of union campaign contributions go to Democrats .
Unions in California also spent heavily _ and unsuccessfully _ to defeat ballot measures ending affirmative action and limiting illegal immigrants ' access to services .
President Clinton has come out against Prop 226 , as have the three Democratic candidates for governor in California .
`` The corporations and the people who represent corporations will have total control if this passes , '' said Joe Chacon , a state employee who was working the phones for labor over the weekend .
`` If unions have no role in the political process , a lot of people who aren n't for the worker will get elected . ''
Supporters , Republican Governor Pete Wilson among them , say unions have no right to spend members ' money on political causes that members may not endorse , and that requiring a member 's approval each year would restore fairness to the process .
Bucher scoffs at labor 's stand , saying Prop 226 would in fact give voice to union members who disagree with union leadership .
`` No one should be coerced under pressure of losing his job to give money to a cause he doesn n't believe in , '' Bucher said , adding that `` labor was 4 - 1 in favor of us at the start .
Their support is still significant , but it certainly isn n't what it was . ''
That , political observers say , is in large part due to the $ 20 million labor has poured into defeating the measure .
The money has gone toward TV ads featuring union members , phone banks run by union members and direct mail sent by union members .
Hundreds of union members have also gone door-to-door to talk to voters .
The irony , as Bucher noted , is that unions are both outspending business interests and spending union members ' money to defeat a measure intended to give them say in how their union dues are spent .
The `` Vote Yes on 226 '' campaign has spent about $ 3 million making its pitch , he said .
`` The ` No ' side has hit chords that resonate with voters : that this will steal the voice of working people , '' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe , a political scientist at Claremont Graduate University .
`` That is powerful rhetoric . ''
Time and again , union members and union leaders speak of their fears that Prop 226 would lead to privatization of Medicare and Medicaid .
They also worry that the disparity between what business and labor spend on politics would become even greater if union members could easily withhold the political portion of their dues .
According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in Washington , D.C. , 93 percent of the $ 58 million labor contributed nationwide during the 1995 - 96 election cycle went to Democrats .
Business spent $ 653 million , with 60 percent of it going to Republicans .
Those totals have led to a slogan of sorts among Prop 226 opponents : Business outspends labor 11 - 1.
But that figure is misleading , since the business total includes contributions by trade groups such as the American Medical Association and by individuals who may have donated money for ideological rather than economic reasons .
Glenn Ellmers , director of research at the nonpartisan Claremont Institute , said a more realistic ratio would be one the Federal Election Commission reached using only corporate PAC and union PAC expenditures .
That study showed business outspending labor by about 2 - 1.
Still , Prop 226 would `` wipe unions off the planet , '' said Andrea Adlemanof the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor .
`` It would have the effect of shutting us up . ''
But as Kim Jacobsma , who teaches American government to high school students , sees it , his union wants to silence him .
Unhappy with union spending on non-union issues , he became what is known as an `` agency fee payer '' in the California Teachers Association , meaning that he pays union dues , minus the 30 percent normally used for politics , but has far fewer rights than a union member .
`` The union talks about being a democratic organization , but it 's pretty much a dictatorship of a few , '' he said .
`` They 're spending members ' money doing things they have no business being involved in . ''
Regardless of Tuesday 's outcome , it is certain to be challenged in court .
Still , Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis , the frontrunner for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , said Prop 226 has promoted the greatest mobilization of labor since California considered right-to-work legislation in 1958 .
