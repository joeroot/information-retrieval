JOHNSON TRADE TALK QUIETS

ST .
PETERSBURG , Fla. _ Unless the Mariners lower their fair-value-in-return expectations , they apparently will have a hard time granting left-hander Randy Johnson 's request to be traded .
Although Johnson has pitched superb back-to-back games since having a meeting with manager Lou Piniella in Texas nearly two weeks ago and being told the best way to get traded is to pitch better , the flurry of recent trade talk hasn n't materialized into a deal .
The Los Angeles Dodgers rejected a proposal that would send right-handed pitcher Darren Dreifort , along with infielder / outfielder Wilton Guerrero to the Mariners , and the New York Yankees refuse to deal left-hander Andy Pettitte .
A source close to the Yankees said Sunday that starting pitcher Ramiro Mendoza and minor-league outfielder Ricky Ledee have been offered , but the M 's insist on getting Pettitte , off limits despite having a sub-par season ( 6 - 5 record ) .
The source said general manager Brian Cashman is interested in Johnson , but in no hurry to make a deal .
The Yankees are runaway leaders in the American League East and believe the Mariners will take less for Johnson closer to the July 31 trading deadline .
With the Dodgers also apparently ready to wait for the price to come down , the trade talk that was roaring last week has quieted and Johnson appears to be getting anxious .
He met with Piniella again Sunday for nearly 45 minutes .
Neither would discuss the gist of the session .
`` We just talked about whether my next start would be in Baltimore ( tomorrow ) or in Seattle on Wednesday , '' Johnson said .
For forty-five minutes ?
`` Pretty long , huh ? ''
he said .
Said Piniella , `` If Randy wants to talk about ( the meeting ) , he can .
As far as I 'm concerned , what we talked about can stay here ( in the manager 's office ) . ''
Woody Woodward , the vice president of baseball operations , returned to Seattle on Sunday and was unavailable for comment .
Johnson 's agent , Barry Meister , said , `` I don n't know if the Mariners are making a legitimate offer ( to other teams ) '' and wouldn n't comment further until he had a chance to talk to his client .
Johnson , scheduled to start against the Anaheim Angels Wednesday night at the Kingdome , has been much more demonstrative in his past two starts than any of the previous 10 this season .
He struck out 15 Tampa Bay Devil Rays in a complete-game victory on May 24 at the Kingdome and beat the ' Rays again Friday night at Tropicana Field , allowing one earned run and striking out 10 in an eight-inning stint .
