SHARES OF FINANCIAL FIRMS UNDER FIRE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE c.1998 The Boston Globe
Is the stock market warning us about the future well-being of Massachusetts financial services companies ?
We can only hope not .
Financial stocks took another pounding yesterday , extending the rout that began in mid-summer .
Some improved amid the market 's furious last-hour rally , but most remained under water .
Other Massachusetts stocks have been hurt in the market gyrations of the last week , including 50 with prices trimmed at least 25 percent over the last five sessions .
Many of these steepest losses have taken place among high technology companies like Aspen Technology Inc. , down 70 percent in the last week , Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. off 44 percent in the last week and off 76 percent since May , and Pegasystems Inc. , which slumped 43 percent in the last week and 73 percent since July .
All three companies are based in Cambridge .
These tech wrecks tend to be driven by a disappointing quarter or some other events specific to those companies , which are generally small .
The financial stock debacle is broader and often more painful .
Nearly all financial companies , which are crucial to the state 's economic health , have suffered steep losses in the stock market .
Consider that :
_ BankBoston , hurt most by fears over its large Latin & QC ; American operations , has lost more than 50 percent of its stock value since a peak set just three months ago .
Fleet Financial Group shares have slumped nearly 28 percent during the same period .
_ Analysts believe pending acquisitions of Springfield Institution for Savings and Sandwich Cooperative Bank appear to be in serious trouble or headed for possible renegotiation , based on recent stock activity .
_ Bank stocks may have received the most attention , but shares in money management firms , insurance firms , and public businesses that serve leading financial industries have also been rocked .
Allmerica Financial Corp. , the Worcester-based insurance company , has shed more than 45 percent since August .
Pioneer Group , the Boston money management firm with interest spread around the globe , is down 60 percent since July .
Investors Financial Services Inc. , which performs back-shop duties for big money managers , has lost 47 percent of its value since August .
BankBoston shares slumped to their lowest level in more than two years yesterday , falling to as low as 25 3 / 4 before recovering to 27 5 / 8 , off 1 1 / 4 for the session .
Analysts warn that even if big banks generate some good news soon _ and many are scheduled to report third quarter results next week _ it will take longer to establish a firm bottom from which stock prices can rise .
`` I can n't emphasize enough that this is a market with no conviction in anything , not earnings , not credit quality not exposure to hedge funds , '' said analyst Nancy Bush of Ryan , Beck & AMP ; Co. `` The banks just don n't have a lot of credibility in this market . ''
Meanwhile , two Massachusetts thrifts that had agreed to mergers have suffered stock declines so serious they suggest the deals may either be restructured or called off .
Shares of Springfield Institution for Savings have fallen from a July peak of 52 5 / 8 to 29 1 / 2 yesterday .
That 44 percent decline , including a loss of 3 per share yesterday , reflects the slumping shares of acquirer Peoples Heritage Financial Inc. of Portland , Maine .
Peoples Heritage had agreed to swap stock to buy the Springfield bank .
The deal was valued at $ 428 million at the time it was announced in July .
SIS can call the deal off if Peoples Heritage stock calls 20 percent or by 15 percent compared to the performance of a group of other thrifts .
Peoples Heritage shares , which have fallen nearly 50 percent since July , is near the 15-percent limit compared to other thrift stocks , according to analyst James Ackor of Tucker Anthony .
But Ackor said both thrifts appear committed to the merger and would probably adjust the terms of the stock swap before calling it off .
`` Peoples is the preferred buyer in the eyes of ( Springfield chief executive ) Bill Marshall , '' he said .
`` The toothpaste is out of the tube . ''
That 's not quite the case on Cape Cod , where Sandwich Cooperative Bank has agreed to be purchased by Seacoast Financial Services Corp. , the new holding company of Compass Bank for Savings in New Bedford .
Sandwich shares , which were valued at 57 1 / 2 at the start of the week , plunged by 16 1 / 2 to 37 yesterday .
Officials at Sandwich and Seacoast both said there was no news at their firms yesterday .
The real worry : Seacoast is a mutual holding company that must covert to a public stock format to make the Sandwich deal work .
But the market for thrift conversions , which boomed only months ago , is considered to be very doubtful today .
`` I believe Compass is going to to have a hard time finding the ( investor ) demand to pull this deal off , '' said Ackor .
