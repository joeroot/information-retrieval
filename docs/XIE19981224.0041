Former Tehran Mayor 's Sentence Reduced
TEHRAN , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- An Iranian appeals court has reduced the prison sentence of former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi from five years to two years , a judicial statement announced on Thursday .
The court also reduced the period Karbaschi was banned from taking public office from 20 years to 10 years , and his lashing sentence was replaced with a cash fine of 10 million rials ( about 1,600 U.S. dollars ) , the Islamic Republic News Agency ( IRNA ) reported .
Karbaschi received five years in prison , a 20-year ban from holding government posts , 60 lashes of the whip and a fine of one billion rials ( about 1.6 million dollars ) when he was publicly tried on charges of graft in July .
The judicial statement said that Karbaschi 's fine of one billion rials remained intact and he was also ordered to return 600 million rials ( about 100,000 dollars ) to the public coffers .
The mayor , a well-known reformist and a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami , had been a target of hard-line political rivals who control the country 's judiciary .
Karbaschi was temporally jailed in April , but was released under an order from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei after political disturbance occurred in the country following his arrest .
So far Karbaschi made no comments on the verdict by the appeals court .
