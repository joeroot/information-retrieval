But most , if not all , are scheduled to open Tuesday .
Even in Mechanicville , where the lucky have days of cleaning up ahead and the unlucky must rebuild their houses , the district 's 1,400 children are scheduled to be back in school Tuesday morning .
`` We have to give the kids some semblance of normality , '' said Greenhall .
