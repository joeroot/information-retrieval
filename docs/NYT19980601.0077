& HT ; Money Talk : Guesswork on college costs is fairly accurate & HT ; By Hank Ezell & HT ; c.

ATLANTA _ A report last week from an educational trade association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of the cost of college tuition .
But a second look shows that we actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just tuition _ of a year in college .
The American Council on Education 's study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages $ 3 , 111 .
In a telephone poll , respondents guessed an average of $ 9 , 694 .
That guess is not far off from the total cost , including tuition , books , room and board , transportation and other expenses .
According to the College Board , that total is $ 10 , 069 .
The council 's study did illuminate American attitudes toward college and their kids .
The majority believe college is worth the price and it is a top concern for their own children .
Most families think they can afford to pay for college .
But they think other families can n't .
In all , the study was like a noisy alarm clock on Monday morning .
You may dread hearing it , but it tells you that you 've got to get started on some important business .
`` If you start early on , paying for college is not overwhelming , '' said Michelle A. Smith , managing director of the Mutual Fund Education Alliance in Kansas City , Mo. `` It is manageable if you start early and stay focused and invest all along the way . ''
There are three main steps to getting started :
Step one , starting when the kids are young , is to begin a college saving program and start investing the money .
Step two , when your child is in high school , is to shake the financial aid machine for all the outside help you can get .
Step three is to borrow the rest .
Far and away , step one is the most rewarding .
It gives you some control over what can be an expensive undertaking , as well as a sense of achievement .
And for kids as well as parents , it signals a commitment that college is important enough for the family to make some sacrifices .
You might be surprised at how much money you can put away , even with a modest investment program .
Uncle Sam will even help you out , at least a little bit , through the newly established education IRAs .
You can put $ 500 a year _ that 's about $ 42 a month _ into an education IRA for each child .
You don n't pay income tax on the earnings each year , and you don n't pay taxes or penalties when you take the money out , assuming you spend it for education .
Suppose you make an 8 percent return each year .
If you start at birth and put that money in every year , you will have about $ 20,200 when your child turns 18 .
It may not cover everything , but it 's a start .
Even if you have to pay taxes on your earnings each year , the compounded growth gets impressive .
Suppose you put away $ 50 a month starting when your child is born .
Suppose you raise the ante each year , putting in $ 60 a month the second year , $ 70 the third year and so on .
Assuming your investments return 8 percent a year , and assuming you pay 34 percent back in federal and state taxes , you still could accumulate about $ 44,300 by your child 's 18th birthday .
It 's the old story of deferred gratification .
Maybe for now you give up one night on the town each month .
That money works for you , and it will make you very happy when you need it later .
When you move to step two , you 're stepping into somebody else 's machine .
It 's a big one : Financial aid totaled $ 50 billion last year , nearly a third of the $ 160 billion spent for education at 3,000 institutions .
Financial aid includes grants , scholarships , loans and part-time jobs .
Like any big machine , it runs by its own rules and at its own speed .
You fill out a long , standardized form that reveals your family finances in great detail .
From that information , colleges figure out how much your family can reasonably be expected to pay .
The rest is your need , and colleges attempt to come up with a package of scholarships , loans and the like that match that amount .
Some of it may be loans , which you or your child will have to repay .
That 's step three .
Many people finance their education with loans .
And there 's an amazing array of loan programs .
A number of them are backed by the federal government and impose low interest rates .
For many families , these programs help make a college degree possible .
It boils down to how hard you 're willing to dig : for scholarships rather than loans , for low-interest loans _ and how much you 're willing to borrow .
