Australian Dollar Hits Six-Month Highs
CANBERRA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The Australian dollar cannoned forward to hit six-month highs Thursday , with enthusiasm attributed to Australia 's internationally competitive interest rates .
The local currency surged more than 1.5 U.S. cents , buoyed by the Reserve Bank of Australia 's failure to ease interest rates in the wake of a cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this week .
It hit a high of 64.78 U.S. cents , and traded during the day between 64.27 and 64.52 , before closing at 64.46 U.S. cents , up from 63.15 at Wednesday 's close .
As well as the favorable interest rate differential , traders said U.S. hedge fund buying also spurred the Australian dollar higher .
IBJ foreign exchange dealer Scott Lewis said the large move higher by the Australian dollar was the result of aggressive U.S. hedge fund buying in offshore markets Wednesday night .
The U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday lowered its fed funds rate for the third time in seven weeks to 4.75 percent from 5.00 percent .
As well , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand also indicated an easing in monetary policy and Wednesday night the Bank of Canada cut rates by 25 basis points .
The call loan target band now stands at 4.75 to 5.25 percent .
However , the Reserve Bank of Australia has not moved on rates , having last reduced them on July 30 , 1997 , by 50 basis points to 5.00 percent .
This means the interest rate differential with the U.S. is now in Australia 's favor , a situation beneficial to the Australian dollar .
Meanwhile , on the cross rates the Australian dollar was buying 78.50 Japanese yen from 76.59 and 1.0805 German marks from 1.0531 .
