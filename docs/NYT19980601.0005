CARDINAL LETS PASS A CHANCE TO TOSS THUNDERBOLTS

NEW YORK _ The media turned out in force at St. Patrick 's Cathedral on Sunday , anticipating yet another in what has lately been a series of public pronouncements by Cardinal John O ' Connor on issues like Little League play on Sundays and domestic partnership legislation .
Perhaps he would weigh in on Terrence McNally 's controversial new play , or comment on some other pressing social issue .
The cardinal , however , stayed focused on Sunday 's confirmation Mass for 25 Catholics with severe disabilities _ although he did manage to find a few opportunities to tweak the assembled reporters .
`` The media may be here because they expect me to say something outrageous today , '' he said , provoking a ripple of laughter through the cathedral .
`` But I 'm sorry to disappoint you .
I wouldn n't dream of trying to upstage these magnificent people . ''
Each year on the Feast of Pentecost , St. Patrick 's Cathedral offers the Sacrament of Confirmation to people who have prepared through the archdiocese 's Office for Persons with Disabilities .
The cardinal told a bit about each of the people , some blind or using crutches or wheelchairs : the 15-year-old who has spina bifida and `` loves animals , and feels he can talk to them '' ; the 8-year-old who is autistic and loves to play on the swings ; the 46-year-old who has brain damage but knows the day of the week by the food he is served .
`` He gets eggs on Tuesday , '' the cardinal said .
`` I don n't get eggs on Tuesday unless we have visitors . ''
As the cardinal introduced the confirmation candidates , he made a couple of sly references to his recent statements that had gained widespread attention .
Talking about a 14-year-old with multiple learning disabilities who plays baseball in a special Little League , the cardinal said , `` But he never plays on Sunday morning . ''
A 10-year-old who has muscular dystrophy realizes he can not play baseball , so his dream is to be the manager for the Yankees .
`` And he will never play ball on Good Friday , '' O ' Connor said .
Both times , the congregation applauded .
O ' Connor carried out his duties without special security precautions after the police investigated a possible threat against him uncovered Saturday .
According to the police , a man had approached a priest at St. Joseph 's Catholic Church on East 87th Street in Manhattan and said that someone `` was going to harm the cardinal '' at the parish 's 100th anniversary Mass , which the cardinal was to celebrate that night .
Additional police officers were assigned , and the Mass was held without incident .
No precautions were taken on Sunday morning beyond the several police officers who are always on hand for Sunday Masses at St. Patrick 's .
The cardinal , a former Navy chaplain , was unfazed by the threat , said his spokesman , Joseph Zwilling .
`` The cardinal used to celebrate Mass in foxholes and on the back of jeeps in Vietnam , '' Zwilling said .
`` He 's a tough man to rattle . ''
