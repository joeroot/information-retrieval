U.S. Online Retailing Enjoys Growth : Study Shows
LOS ANGELES , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- While still in an emerging state , the online retail market in the United States is enjoying robust growth , according to a study released Wednesday .
The study , conducted by the trade association for U.S. online retailers -- shop.org -- based on polls of 127 online retailers in seven categories , revealed that annual growth stood at 200 percent and the top 10 publicly traded online retailers have witnessed year-on-year revenue growth in excess of 160 percent .
It also found that while many consumers are visiting online retailers , few are buying .
Online revenues generated by North American-based retailers for the first six months of 1998 were 4.4 billion U.S. dollars , less than 1 percent of overall retail revenue , according to the study .
However , full year online revenues for retailers will surpass 13 billion .
Online retailers are investing heavily now to expand their reach and customer bases , shop.org said in a related report .
Some 65 percent of the revenues generated through online services are reinvested in marketing and advertising , compared with 4 percent for most traditional stores .
