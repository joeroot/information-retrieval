Computerized Fruit Marketing Emerges in East China City
FUZHOU , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Computer networks have replaced yelling for street sales by orange growers in Jian ' ou , a city to the north of east China 's Fujian Province .
The city is a major orange-growing area , harvesting 16,200 tons of orange in 1997 .
In the past , this kind of harvest might not lead to assured earnings at year 's end because of inadequate market information .
Farmers were often forced to peddle their fruit to all-comers at less than cost .
Then in June , the city government invested in a nonstaple agricultural commodity circulation center that has been hooked up with the national postal computer network as well as supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide .
The center now serves as a price indicator providing up-to-date prices on China 's 26 major fruit markets as well as local marketing messages .
Last year , it coordinated more than 400 tons of orange sales worth more than nine million yuan .
Meanwhile , the center also specialized in market surveys and analyses to guide local orange farmers .
So far , harvested oranges in Jian ' ou have all been sold out .
