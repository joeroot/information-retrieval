Progressing Urbanization in China
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Urbanization has progressed rapidly in china in the past two decades as a result of the reform and opening-up policy since 1978 , reported today 's China Daily .
China 's urbanization level grew form 19.4 percent in 1978 to 29.9 percent at the end of 1997 , according to Liu Jinsheng , a division chief of the Ministry of Construction .
The official number of Chinese cities had reached 668 by last year , and registered towns totalled 18 , 984 .
A number of metropolitan areas have formed around major cities , including the Bohai Bay area centered on Beijing , Tianjin , Qingdao , Shenyang and Dalian .
Another such metropolitan area has emerged in the Yangtze River Delta around shanghai , Nanjing , Hangzhou and Ningbo , and still another in the Pearl River Delta around Guangzhou and Shenzhen .
According to Liu , more than 290 cities , or 43 percent of China 's total , are scattered through the eastern coastal areas , while only 126 are located in the inland west .
In 1995 , the state allocated about 77 billion yuan ( 9.3 billion U.S. dollars ) for city construction .
Only 10.9 percent went to the western regions .
Experts say the gap between eastern and western areas is mainly a result of different population densities and socioeconomic development .
They say care must be taken when accelerating city construction in China .
Construction should be carried out in accordance with the state 's policy of giving priority to small and medium-sized towns and cities .
They also suggest that chaotic expansion of some existing large cities and towns should be curbed , protection of farm land and development of agriculture and animal husbandry should be taken into consideration when planning city construction .
City construction should be aimed at enhancing the reform of local economic structures and making full use of local resources .
