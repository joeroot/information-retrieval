Times News Service
NEW YORK _ Audiovox Corp. and the Bosch Telecom unit of Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany plan to announce Tuesday the availability of a wireless telephone that can operate on different continents without modification .
The new phone is based on a digital technology known as global system for mobile communications , or GSM .
While other technologies are more popular than GSM in the United States , GSM is the dominant digital wireless technology overseas , especially in Europe .
Omnipoint Corp. , which provides wireless service in the New York area using GSM technology , plans to announce that it is offering the new phone Tuesday .
George Schmitt , president of Omnipoint 's wireless operation , said the phone would probably cost $ 299 and would let users make and receive calls in foreign countries as if they were at home .
People who use Omnipoint and other GSM wireless carriers can often do those things already , but they generally must first get a special phone for use abroad .
`` It basically makes it a lot simpler for our customers to roam around the world , '' Schmitt said .
`` It 's equally important that people coming here from overseas be able to get a clear service . ''
The GSM Alliance , a group made up of 13 North American GSM wireless companies , said the new phone could be used in more than 110 countries .
After Omnipoint , the next carrier to offer the new phone will be BellSouth 's Mobility DCS operation .
The GSM Alliance said North America 's other major GSM carriers would offer the new phone by the end of the year .
The other members of the alliance are : Aerial Communications Inc. , Airadigm Communications Inc. ; the Conestoga Wireless Company ; Cook Inlet PCS ; DIGIPH PCS ; Microcell Telecommunications Inc. ; NPI Wireless ; Pacific Bell Mobile Services ; Powertel Inc. ; Western Wireless Corp. and Wireless 2000 PCS .
