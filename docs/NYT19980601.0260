LIPS ARE THE RAGE THESE DAYS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By DIANE WHITE c.1998 The Boston Globe
`` My lips are disappearing , '' a friend says , looking in the mirror .
They don n't look any different , to me at least .
Maybe she thinks they 're disappearing because she 's comparing them to fashion 's latest word on lips , i.e. , bigger is better .
I switched on the TV the other day just in time to hear a makeup consultant say , `` lips are all over the place this season . ''
Since I tuned in late , I 'm not exactly sure what he meant by this .
But lips are everywhere these days , or maybe it just seems that way because they 're so much bigger than they used to be , so they take up more space .
Thumbing through fashion magazines , one can see page after page of models with huge , puffy , pouting lips .
Sometimes it looks all right , if the lips are in proportion to the rest of the face .
But in some cases the lips dominate every other feature , so that 's all you see _ lips .
Many of these models owe their luscious lip lines to collagen injections .
The acting profession , too , is full of women whose lips , like certain other portions of their anatomies , appear suspiciously enhanced .
Collagen or not ?
Calista Flockhart ?
Maybe .
Michelle Pfeiffer ?
I wouldn n't be surprised .
Kirstie Alley ?
Definitely .
Cher ?
Can there be any doubt ?
Even Kathie Lee appears to have stopped talking long enough to let a cosmetic surgeon plump up her lips .
It only takes a few minutes .
Collagen injections are increasingly popular , according to statistics compiled by the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery .
But collagen is not forever , which must cause a certain amount of rejoicing in cosmetic surgery circles .
It wears off as it 's absorbed by the body , so the procedure has to be redone periodically .
Despite its plastic-sounding name , collagen is a natural substance , derived from the skin of cows , so physicians say it 's safe , unless the patient has an allergy to it .
The only real danger would seem to be getting carried away and ending up with the lip equivalent of a DD-cup .
Looking sexy is , of course , what big lips are all about .
`` Thin lips ( or chicken lips ) are no longer considered appealing , '' writes Helen Bransford in `` Welcome to Your Facelift : What to Expect Before , During and After Cosmetic Surgery . ''
The good news _ at least I think it 's good news _ is that there 's an even more natural cure than collagen for chicken lips .
Bransford writes : `` Your own fat may be harvested from another location ( like your butt ) to protect you from an allergic reaction , then transplanted into your lips . ''
I like the concept of fat harvesting .
It sounds so much more wholesome than liposuction , as if they were going to store it in a silo or something , in case of emergency .
For those who long for luscious lips yet hesitate to have cosmetic surgery , help is at hand .
The June issue of the SelfCare catalog , one of my favorite publications , has the Lip Enhancer , a transparent acrylic vacuum tube .
According to the blurb , for only $ 40 plus shipping and handling , it `` makes lips attractively fuller without the expense , pain or risk of collagen injections !
Simply place the mouthpiece around your lips and pull on the cylinder .
The gentle vacuum creates a lovely fullness ...
the effect is quite rejuvenating ! ''
Unless you go at it too strenuously .
`` It is important to be patient and to follow directions carefully , '' the ad copy warns .
`` In the beginning , you may experience slight bruising or reddening on or around your lips . ''
I 'm sure it 's worth the risk .
But could you get the same effect by sticking your lips in a vacuum cleaner hose and turning the thing on full blast ?
I 'm just asking .
