Here are some companies that make America 's rivers come alive .
Prices are per person , based on double occupancy .
& HT ; Despite the name , Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West ( 4th & AMP ; Battery Bldg . , Suite 700 , Seattle , Wash. 98121 ; 800 - 426-7702 ) offers more than some of the best cruises in Alaska .
They have seven-night , round-trip , small ship cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers from Portland , Ore. , starting at $ 925 .
& HT ; These trips , from March to May and again in September and October , run on the 78-passenger `` Spirit of Alaska '' and the 84-passenger `` Spirit of Discovery . ''
& HT ; The ships follow in the wake of Lewis and Clark on this 1,000-mile journey , negotiating eight locks and dams each way on the Columbia and Snake Rivers .
& HT ; The highlight occurs at the port of Clarkston , Wash. , where guests switch to high-speed jet boats for a 140-mile round-trip on the Snake River into Hells Canyon .
& HT ; All shore excursions , including visits to wineries , historic forts , the Whitman Mission and the Maryhill Museum , are included .
& HT ; The company also offers California wine country cruises from September to October on the 102-passenger `` Spirit of Endeavour '' and the 96-passenger `` Spirit of 98 . ''
& HT ; The three-night trip starts at $ 645 and sails round-trip from San Francisco , travels up the Sacramento River to the heart of Old Town Sacramento , then up the Napa River to the Napa Valley , with visits to the Schramsberg and Carneros Alambic wineries and lunch at Clos Pegasse winery .
& HT ; The four-night cruise starts at $ 855 and follows a similar itinerary , with the addition of a day in Sonoma and tastings at Domaine Carneros and a lunch at Merryvale Winery .
& HT ; History , culture and nature all the hallmarks of this cruise line .
& HT ; American West Steamboat Company ( 601 Union St. , Suite 4343 , Seattle , Wash. 98101 ; 800 - 434-1232 ) operates the 163-passenger sternwheeler , `` Queen of the West . ''
& HT ; A replica of the classic 19th - century paddlewheelers , the ship follows a nearly 1,000-mile itinerary on the Columbia , Snake and Willemette Rivers for seven nights .
& HT ; The main lounge features nightly variety entertainment , similar to that aboard showboats in the 19th century .
& HT ; Shore excursions , which are included in the price of the cruise , include a ride on the Mt. Hood Railroad , the Columbia Gorge Discovery Center and jet boats on Hells Canyon .
Rates start at $ 1 , 045 .
& HT ; The Delta Queen Steamboat Company ( Robin Street Wharf , 1380 Port of New Orleans Place , New Orleans , La. 70130 - 1890 ; 800 - 543-7637 ) is probably the best-known river boat cruise company in the country .
& HT ; They offer three - to 14-night steamboat cruise on the Mississippi River , the Ohio River , the Tennessee River , the Cumberland River , the Arkansas River , the Illinois River , the Kanawha River , the Atchafalaya River , the Red River and the Intracoastal Waterway .
& HT ; The three steamboats that the line uses have become American icons .
There 's the 174-passenger Delta Queen , built in 1925 - 1927 and designated a National Historic Landmark ; the 414-passenger Mississippi Queen , built in 1976 ; and the 436-passenger American Queen , built in 1995 .
& HT ; Together , they offer a distinctive way to experience the heartland of America .
& HT ; While the newer vessels have been built with modern amenities , the restored Delta Queen has been likened to staying in a Victorian bed and breakfast , with the old-fashioned elegance associated with brass , hardwood paneling and Tiffany-style stained-glass windows .
& HT ; There are dozens of itineraries year-round among the ships , as well as theme cruises that focus on the `` Civil War , '' `` Big Band , '' `` Gardens of the River '' and even `` The Elvis Years . ''
& HT ; Take a typical seven-night cruise aboard the Delta Queen this July , which embarks in Nashville , Tenn. , and ends in Little Rock , Ark. & HT ; Navigating the Cumberland , Ohio , Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers , the fares for this journey , with Memphis as a highlight , start at $ 1 , 050 .
& HT ; RiverBarge Excursion Lines ( 201 Opelousas Ave. , New Orleans , La. 70114 ; 888 - 650-5041 ; ) is a new company and its first vessel , `` R/B River Explorer , '' sets sail on Aug. 22 .
& HT ; What sets the `` R/B River Explorer '' apart is the fact that it 's a hotel barge , designed to travel along both rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway on four - to 10-day excursions .
& HT ; The company claims that it 's the first American-built , flagged and crewed hotel barge offered in North America .
& HT ; The `` R/B River Explorer '' is actually comprised of two barges , the La Salle and the De Soto , and is propelled by the towboat , `` Miss Nari . ''
& HT ; All cabins are outside and a minimum of 200 square feet , with the usual cruise chip amenities , from televisions with VCRs to telephones with modem ports to full-size bathrooms .
& HT ; Take `` The Route of Jean Lafitte , '' which goes between New Orleans and Port Isabel , Texas , along the Gulf Coast .
This eight-day cruise , which starts in New Orleans and ends in Galveston , Texas , starts at $ 1 , 730 .
& HT ; Other trips include `` Delta South , '' a four - or five-day trip that goes round-trip from New Orleans .
& HT ; The eight-day trip ends in Memphis , with stops at Natchez and Vicksburg , Mississippi as well as Baton Rouge , Louisiana .
& HT ; Prices range from $ 740 for the four-day trip to $ 1,730 for the eight-day voyage .
& HT ; Shore excursions , as well as tips , taxes and port charges are included with the price .
