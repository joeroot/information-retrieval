CHICAGO _ Merger mania may be running amok in the world of commerce , but in the world of civics the opposite seems to be happening .
Cities and counties dotting the country are in the grip of secession fever .
In California , the San Fernando Valley has been brazenly unfaithful to the city of Los Angeles , doing all it can to get a divorce .
Last month in New York , the rural East End of Long Island filed suit , trying to force the State Legislature to allow it to secede from Suffolk County and form Peconic County .
In Maine , a legislator submitted a bill last year seeking to study the feasibility of making northern Maine the 51st state .
A Maryland lawmaker recently asked his Legislature to let Eastern Shore residents decide if they want to form their own state .
And in March , seeking attention over a nettlesome fishing dispute , people in a sliver of Minnesota called the Northwest Angle got their congressman to propose a constitutional amendment allowing them to secede from the United States and join Canada .
Taking a cue , perhaps , from places like Scotland and Quebec , break-up talk is bleeding into legislatures and city halls .
Some of it is intended to draw attention to neglected issues .
But most of it stems from a serious desire for more local autonomy .
Even so , as Staten Island learned in its failed secession battle five years ago , these movements have dim prospects because they usually must be approved by governing bodies of the very places they want to leave .
The only movement currently given a fighting chance is in the San Fernando Valley , the suburban sprawl of 1.4 million people that spawned the nasally hip Valley Girl .
An organized campaign by constituents who believe they receive too few city services for their high taxes is seeking to create what would be the nation 's sixth-largest city .
The effort gained ground in October with a law that bars city councils from vetoing secession initiatives , though there are still hurdles : petition signatures of 25 percent of registered voters , a viability study and a majority vote for secession in both the Valley and Los Angeles .
`` People feel that they 're not getting a fair shake in the existing arrangements , '' said Richard Briffault , a professor at Columbia University Law School who has written about legal issues in secession but is neutral on its desirability .
`` Usually , it 's a group that 's a population minority in the larger entity .
They are also different in some significant way , whether it 's based on ethnicity or based on politics or based on economics . ''
In Maryland , the conservative Eastern Shore has chafed under state laws on gun control and wetlands preservation , but `` the straw that broke the camel 's back , '' said State senator Richard L. Colburn , a Republican , was the response when a toxic microbe killed thousands of fish in Chesapeake Bay last year .
Tracing the problem to manure runoff at chicken farms , the major Eastern Shore industry , the governor proposed stricter environmental regulations costly to the poultry industry .
`` We feel we should control our own destiny , '' said Colburn , who introduced a bill this session that was buried in committee but may resurface .
Colburn wants to call the new state Delmarva ( after the peninsula shared by Delaware and Virginia ) , and said it would have no sales tax , loose environmental regulation and a blue flag with one star like the Bonnie Blue flown by some southern states in the Civil War .
Some activists and politicians see secession as a movement whose time has come , a welcome backlash to the consolidation that began earlier in the century , when most cities grew by annexing territory .
A few cities , like Indianapolis and Nashville , have merged with their suburbs in recent years , but some experts say the pendulum is swinging the other way .
In Los Angeles , which has always been a diffuse collection of neighborhoods , Venice , San Pedro and other communities are also talking secession .
`` Fracturing cities might be the best way to form more efficient governments , '' said Howard Husock , director of case studies and public policy at Harvard University 's John F. Kennedy School of government .
He also favors a `` quasi-secession '' movement in Dade County , Fla. , where four unincorporated areas near Miami have voted to turn themselves into municipalities .
`` Small municipalities can control things like schools , zoning and other functions , and form compacts with other communities for other services , like fire departments , '' Husock said .
Tom McClintock , a Republican Assemblyman who co-wrote the California law opening the door to secession movements , puts the argument in grander terms .
`` Large , centralized command-and-control structures were very much a 20th - century phenomenon , actually a throwback to medieval governing modalities , '' he said .
`` We have been re-learning the lessons of the Enlightenment , that human institutions produce far more satisfactory results when powers are decentralized and disbursed . ''
Kevin Starr , a California historian who is the state librarian , fears that breaking up Los Angeles would leave behind a shell of a city .
He said he saw some secession movements as `` a kind of shock therapy . ''
`` It 's like a married couple when one person doesn n't really want a divorce but moves out , '' he added .
`` Everybody starts rethinking the relationship . ''
Some proponents claim they reap benefits even if they don n't gain independence because the media attention forces elected officials to take notice .
`` Even without Peconic County being formed , we have seen a lot of attention , '' said Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr. , a Republican from Sag Harbor , N.Y . , who twice introduced legislation asking for a binding referendum on forming a new county , to no avail .
Thiele believes the threat of secession has prompted politicians to favor his constituents on issues like farmland preservation and real-estate transfer taxes .
In Maine , State Representative Henry Joy , a Republican who introduced the secession study bill , said forest and land regulations were restricting economic growth in northern Maine .
He said the bill generated `` hearings around the state to discuss the feasibility of economic development in rural areas . ''
It also convinced Joy to run for governor this year .
Rep. Collin Peterson , the Democrat who introduced the constitutional amendment in Minnesota , said the 100 residents of the Northwest Angle didn n't really want to leave the country _ only to solve their problems with Ontario over regulation of the Lake of the Woods , which dips into Minnesota .
He acknowledged that secession publicity got him a meeting with Canadian officials .
`` The people in the Northwest Angle decided the only way to get something resolved was to create an international incident , '' Peterson said .
`` Initially , their idea was to blockade a train . ''
