TV GUIDE 'S 50 GREATEST MOMENTS FULL OF STATIC
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By BOB RYAN c.1998 The Boston Globe
If TV Guide had only bothered to explain itself , we 'd have a clearer picture of how it managed to screw up its list of 50 Greatest Sports Moments so badly .
A Top Anything list is an opinion , of course .
We all understand that .
Just because I think `` Things We Said Today '' is the greatest of all Beatles songs doesn n't mean you 'll agree .
And let 's give TV Guide credit for anticipating rants like this one .
`` Our list is bound to spark debate , '' the compilers write , `` because the only thing we like more than watching sports is arguing about them . ''
Agreed .
So how could you people take the 1968 Houston-UCLA game , merely the most important college basketball game in history , and rank it 49th ?
How could you insert two NASCAR happenings in your Top 50 ?
How could you make the Thrilla In Manila , which six people watched on an embryonic network called HBO , and rank it ( itals ) anywhere , ( unitals ) let alone No. 2 ?
Something else : Did television sports begin in 1960 ?
Or did we all dream we watched the Colts beat the Giants in Yankee Stadium on Dec. 28 , 1958 , in pro football 's first overtime game ?
Was not Bobby Thomson 's home run _ the most electrifying moment in baseball history _ on TV ?
And so what if it took place on Oct. 3 , 1951 ?
I would wager that a few more people watched that game than were privileged to see the Thrilla In Manila 24 years later .
Now I trust you 're sitting down .
In its July 11 - 17 issue , TV Guide has ranked the 50 Greatest Sports Moments and has failed to include _ and I swear I am not making this up _ Super Bowl III .
I reread the article approximately 111 times to make sure I hadn n't missed it .
Borg-McEnroe at Wimbledon ( 1980 ) is No. 5 , and Bonnie Blair winning her fourth gold medal is No. 20 , and Hagler-Hearns is No. 37 ( a good fight , but no Archie Moore-Yvon Durelle ) , but Joe Namath & AMP ; Co. blowing apart the myth of NFL invincibility doesn n't even make the cut ?
C ' mon , people , if you don n't know enough to include Jets 16 , Colts 7 , you automatically forfeit credibility .
There is a distinct lack of historical perspective on display here .
The two most important college basketball games ever played are the Houston-UCLA game of Jan. 20 , 1968 , when a national audience watched Elvin Hayes and Houston upend mighty UCLA ; and the 1979 game when Magic Johnson 's Michigan State team defeated Larry Bird 's Indiana State team in what remains the highest-rated NCAA championship game ever .
The Houston-UCLA game was riveting , and the fallout buzz changed the scope of college basketball forever .
It 's got to be a Top 10 event .
The Michigan State-Indiana State game wasn n't so hot , but no college baskketball game has ever been more ( itals ) anticipated , ( unitals ) and as such , it 's a Top 20 TV event , for sure .
What is the matter with these people ?
Julius Erving makes one nice up-and-under swoop against the Lakers in 1980 and that 's good enough for No. 24 ?
( itals ) Twenty-four ? ( unitals ) Larry Bird shooting 15 for 20 in the 1984 Heat Game ?
The 1976 Celtic-Suns Triple OT ?
Michael Jordan 's amazing right-hand-to-left-hand midair shift against the Lakers in 1991 ?
Jordan 's 35-point first half against Portland a year later ?
If they wanted some NBA moments , we could have supplied them with some NBA moments , no sweat .
They did get one right , and I 'd have put it even higher .
Checking in at No. 10 is Jayne Torville and Christopher Dean 's spellbinding `` Bolero '' dance routine from the Sarajevo Olympics .
This was the ultimate proof that figure skating isn n't even a sport , since six of the lunkhead judges couldn n't even bring themselves to award perfect 6's on technical merit , settling for nitpicking 5.9 's .
What Torville and Dean did had far more to do with art than sport .
It dignified us as a species .
It was numerically unjudgeable , and it probably would have been a good idea if figure skating had just closed up shop and gone home right then and there , because none of us will live long enough to see anything better .
As a TV Olympic moment , I 'd put it in the Top 5.
They don n't come right out and say why the oldest event is the 1960 Olympic decathlon duel between Rafer Johnson and C.K .
Yang ( No.
16 ) .
If they 're making an arbitrary cutoff date of 1960 , they should say so .
People watched sports on TV by the millions during the '50s .
Baseball All-Star Games were huge .
Stan Musial 's 12th - inning game-winning homer in 1955 at Milwaukee was very big .
And World Series , plural ?
Whoa !
How about Willie Mays 's catch in 1954 ?
Omigod !
The Dodgers beating the Yankees for Brooklyn 's only World Series title in 1955 ?
Hey !
Don Larsen 's perfect game ?
They got the second US Olympic hockey victory over the dreaded Russkies , ( No.
23 ) , but they missed the first one in 1960 .
I 'm here to say it was on TV .
The 1963 USC-Wisconsin Rose Bowl , a k a the Ron Vanderkelen show ?
That had people talking for years .
You can n't exaggerate how important baseball was in the first 60 years of the century , so where is Bill Mazeroski 's home run that beat the Yankees in 1960 ?
Please .
Jimmy Connors mugging his way past Aaron Krickstein in 1991 checks in at a truly incomprehensible 28 ?
Do me a favor .
Stop the next 100,000 people not named Bud Collins you meet on the street and ask them if they remember Jimmy Connors beating Aaron Krickstein .
Then consider that No. 29 is Kirk Gibson 's 1988 World Series home run off Dennis Eckersley .
Your next question will undoubtedly be , who are these fools , anyway ?
All right , what about No. 1 ?
It 's our guy Pudge whacking that Pat Darcy pitch off the left-field foul pole , so I guess nobody around here is about to quarrel with that judgment .
Thanks to legendary director Harry Coyle 's genius , the sight of Carlton Fisk attempting to direct the ball to stay fair will always remain a wonderful TV moment .
We all agree that it was a transcendent World Series in 1975 and that Game 6 was a baseball novella .
It was exquisite .
But it wasn n't the Jets and Colts , and so we 're back where we started .
It 's one thing to offer a disclaimer about the desire to provoke debate , and it 's another thing to provide a list that does away with the first 15 years of TV sports history and then omits Super Bowl III , a seminal event in American sports history .
TV Guide recently offered a nice Sinatra retrospective .
Perhaps this magazine should stick to entertainment issues and leave sports to people who actually know sports .
