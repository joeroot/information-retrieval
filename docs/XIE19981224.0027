Pakistan Concerned over India-Russia Military Pact
ISLAMABAD , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Pakistan expressed " grave concern and dismay " on Thursday over the decade-long agreement on technical military cooperation signed by India and Russia this week .
" We are gravely concerned and dismayed that at the turn of the millennium , when promotion of peace and economic development are the focus of endeavors in other regions , South Asia must bear the burden of a massive new weapons program for the fulfillment of India 's hegemonistic goals , " Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said at a press briefing .
According to the press here , the agreement is wide ranging and provides for massive purchases of arms by India while involving the transfer of high technology and sophisticated weapons from Russia worth 16 billion U.S. dollars over the next decade .
The Indian purchases would mean the acquisition of sophisticated new weapon systems in the region such as airborne early warning systems , new generation tanks , SU-30 aircraft and nuclear powered submarines , Altaf said .
He added that " the acquisition of sophisticated weapons would destroy the balance of power in an already precarious and highly volatile security environment . "
Altaf said that South Asia as a region can not afford an arms race and a further diversion of a huge amount of funds which will consequently be spent in the purchase of latest weaponry .
" Pakistan will also be forced to augment its defense capabilities through all available means , " he added .
Altaf said , " The Indian focus on further accumulation of military power will reinforce its intransigence toward the resolution of disputes and the reduction of tensions in our region . "
These developments would provide a negative impact on Pakistan 's efforts to promote restraint regime in a nuclear South Asia , he said , adding that the bilateral dialogue process between Pakistan and India will be immeasurably affected .
The Spokesman called upon the international community , particularly the major powers and the U.N. , to take note of this dangerous development which threatens the peace and security of the region .
" Consequently , at a larger level , this constitutes a challenge to global security and peace , " he added .
