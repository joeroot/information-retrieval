Revised Law to Increase Securities Market Transparency
BEIJING , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese legislators are putting the finishing touches on the long-awaited securities law to ensure that it embrace a wider range of market factors .
The Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress has made at least six changes in the draft law concerning stock floatation , listings and trading .
The revised draft stipulates that the special committee responsible for examing and approving stock floating should be composed of professionals from the State Council 's securities watchdog institutions and experts outside these institutions as well .
Members of the committee should vote on stock floating applications and the procedures should be open and supervised " to enhance transparency and fairness , " the revised law says .
The revised draft grants companies seeking public listing the right to choose their stock underwriters , instead of accepting underwriters designated by the government , as the original draft suggested .
The draft law prohibits state firms or listed companies from operating in the market in the name of individual stock investors .
The revised draft also spells out harsher punishments for violations .
For example , violators will have to pay fines several times the amount of their illicit gains .
The draft will be voted on tomorrow , along with the revised law on military service and a decision on punishments for foreign exchange fraud .
