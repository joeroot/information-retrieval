SUIT EXPOSES QUESTIONABLE TACTICS BY LAND CONSERVANCY GROUPS

HIGH FALLS , N.Y .
_ Karen Pardini and Michael Fink , two middle-aged children of the back-to-the-land 1960s , had long had their eyes on a largely untamed patch in the Shawangunk Mountains .
So when the land became available in 1986 , they cobbled together a down payment to buy 211 acres and began fixing up a tumbledown barn .
For eight years , they camped out in woods and took pleasure in their land , sometimes hiking to a ridge at the end of their property to savor the soaring views of the Catskills .
Then one day , as Ms. Pardini walked along the road that cuts across her property , she noticed pink and yellow ribbons put up by a local surveyor .
Someone else , she realized , coveted her property .
It eventually turned out there was a claimant , and it was not a wily real estate speculator but a land preservation group , the Shawangunk Conservancy .
The conservancy , one of 1,100 such groups nationwide that pride themselves on their ethics by buying from willing sellers with unclouded titles , had long desired the land as a missing link in a 50-mile chain of ridgeland that it wants to render forever wild for the pleasure of hikers and climbers .
The group produced two unorthodox deeds that , it argued , proved that it now had possession of almost half of the land Fink and Ms. Pardini thought they owned .
In the long , nasty quarrel that followed , a judge ruled in March that the conservancy 's deeds were worthless and said Ms. Pardini and Fink could sue for fraud .
As a result , the conservancy and other groups that preserve land in the Shawangunks have found themselves on the defensive .
Even some other land preservationists have accused the conservancy of overzealous tactics .
`` Land conservation for many people is a crusade , '' said David Church , executive director of the New York Planning Federation , which advocates sound land use .
`` And well-meaning or not , what you discover on a crusade is that the means are justified by the ends . ''
The conservancy is appealing the judge 's decision .
Keith LaBudde , its president , says it acquired the disputed land in legal and upright fashion because Ms. Pardini and Fink never authentically owned it .
He rejects the idea that his group should have passed up the disputed land rather than distress people who bought the land in good faith .
`` Environmentalists are supposed to be featherheads , is that it ? ''
said LaBudde , a 63-year-old retired professor of computer science .
`` I think what you do is pursue with rigor , you look at all the facts and approach it in a businesslike way . ''
The dispute has had some wider ramifications as well .
Though the conservancy is a small , 10-year-old organization , it works to acquire land with much richer and better known organizations in New York like the Mohonk Preserve and the Open Space Institute .
Together , the three groups have assembled more than 10,000 acres in the breathtaking Shawangunks , which stretch from the Delaware River almost to the Hudson and are the setting for the popular and historic Mohonk Mountain House resort near New Paltz .
The Pardini-Fink dispute is not the first in which residents in the New Paltz-High Falls area have felt mistreated by preservationists .
At least two other landowners say that within the last 10 years they were pressured to give up long-held mountainside properties after they were barred from using the rights of way to the land .
The Mohonk Preserve eventually acquired the properties .
The preserve denies that it acted improperly and says that the disputes were complicated by such factors as conflicts with neighboring landowners .
At bottom , Fink and Ms. Pardini accuse the conservancy of trying to steal their land by tactics more fitting a real estate operator than an upright environmental group .
`` Everybody knew it was our property , '' Fink said in a recent interview .
`` Just because the bike wasn n't in the backyard and tied up doesn n't give you permission to take it . ''

Ms. Pardini had long craved the land .
Almost 15 years before she and Fink made the down payment , Ms. Pardini camped out at Smitty 's Dude Ranch here .
It had a bar popular with hippies and was owned by an engaging character , Wilbur Smith , who kept his land in his wives ' names .
In 1983 , Ms. Pardini , a midwife and teacher of African dance , met Fink , who made a living selecting trees for lumber .
They fell in love and talked about one day buying `` Smitty 's '' land .
In 1986 , they raised enough for the $ 300,000 purchase by asking their parents and a sister to mortgage their homes .
Eight years later , they saw the ribbons put up by Norman Van Valkenburgh , the surveying consultant for both the conservancy and the Mohonk Preserve .
Van Valkenburgh , a former director of lands and forests for the state 's Department of Environmental Conservation , has a crusty appreciation of land disputes , writing mystery novels about such conflicts with titles like `` Murder in the Catskills . ''
Poking around in deeds for land the conservancy might buy up for preservation , he wrote a letter in 1994 to Smith 's first wife , Mary Lue , telling her `` it may come as a surprise , '' but she still owned 30 acres of Fink-Pardini land .
A 1965 deed by which she conveyed the land to his second wife ended with a comma in the middle of a sentence , omitting the pages that described two parcels .
Fink and Ms. Pardini said it was a 30-year-old clerical error .
Van Valkenburgh said , `` How did I know it was a clerical error ? ''
The conservancy paid Mary Lue Smith $ 5,000 for her title .
But in an affidavit in the Fink-Pardini case , Mary Lue , who eventually remarried Wilbur Smith as his third wife , said Van Valkenburgh and the conservancy 's counsel , Robert Anderberg , `` misled and tricked me and my husband '' into accepting $ 5 , 000 .
She said they had implied that the land was unclaimed and landlocked .
Van Valkenburgh replied that he showed the Smiths deeds and maps .
The conservancy also tried to claim another piece of Fink-Pardini land using another deed with an aberrant pedigree .
In 1982 , two outdoorsmen , Wayne Kelder and his brother-in-law , Lars Hagen , bought 40 acres of ridgeland for $ 7,000 from the heirs of a woman whose own acquisitions were based on fuzzy deeds dating from 1911 , 1928 , 1937 and 1946 .
The boundaries were highly questionable , defined only by the adjoining owners rather than by the usual manner of distance and angle from the nearest roads .
Although Kelder and Hagen admit they had only a sketchy idea of where their land was , they spent 13 years hunting and cutting wood on the property without protests , never realizing it was owned first by the dude ranch and then by Ms. Pardini and Fink .
The accumulation of conflicting claims persuaded Hagen and Kelder to sell the land to the conservancy for $ 37,500 rather than become mired in costly litigation .
LaBudde said he `` never had any suspicion '' the land was owned by Ms. Pardini and Fink .
Nevertheless , he added , `` We recognized we were buying a problem . ''
One issue the dispute has exposed is that deeds and tax maps can be hazy in mountainous woodland where owners are cavalier about boundaries .
The location of the Kelder-Hagen claim is so uncertain that Van Valkenburgh believes the conservancy can use it to assert ownership of 136 acres of Pardini-Fink land .
Van Valkenburgh believes that the Kelder-Hagen land is actually the next parcel to the south .
Yet , he maintains , the conservancy can claim the land the outdoorsmen lived on by a legal principle known as adverse possession , which entitles an occupant to ownership of someone else 's land if after many years there are no protests .
In March , Justice Vincent Bradley of New York Supreme Court in Ulster County rejected the conservancy 's deed for the Kelder-Hagen parcel as worthlessly vague and its deed for the Pardini-Fink land as exploiting an obvious clerical error .
Ms. Pardini and Fink are not celebrating the judge 's ruling .
They have spent $ 36,000 on legal fees and fear that in the appeals process , the conservancy may have the resources to wear them down .
Twelve years after buying their land , they still live in a house in Kingston , 10 miles away , because the money and time spent on the dispute have stalled plans to make the barn habitable .
Fink and Ms. Pardini have been told they could get $ 2 million for their land .
But they say they will not sell .
`` What could you buy with the money that could replace this ? ''
Ms. Pardini asked , gazing out over her land .
