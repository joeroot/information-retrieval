Lawyers ' Role Enhanced in Chinese Courts ( 1 )
TIANJIN , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Major reforms to the system of criminal procedure in the past year have greatly enhanced the role of Chinese lawyers in the courts and made the lawyer 's profession a more attractive one in China .
According to local law experts , the growing eminence of Chinese lawyers conveys a message that this most populous country in the world has made further progress in its protection of citizens ' rights by law .
One year ago , the National People 's Congress , China 's legislature , made major amendments to the country 's Criminal Procedure Law .
The amended law enhances lawyers ' involvement in the criminal process by allowing them to provide legal service for suspects during the investigation of a criminal case and granting them greater power in court trials .
Recently , the supreme bodies of legislation , trial and justice in China also jointly issued supplementary regulations on the enforcement of the new Criminal Procedure Law , which explicitly defines lawyers ' rights to meet with criminal suspects and collect evidence .
The regulations stipulate that during the investigation of a criminal case , suspects or their relatives have the right to engage lawyers , and the investigative organs are held responsible for the timely transfer of suspects ' requests for the assistance of lawyers .
Moreover , the investigative organs must make timely requests to relevant departments to recommend lawyers for suspects or their relatives who are unable to name a specific candidate .
An official with the Ministry of Public Security told Xinhua that from now on , the police will inform criminal suspects about their right to access to a lawyer when taking them into custody .
" This will probably complicate our investigations , but we will do everything strictly in accordance with the law , " he noted .
