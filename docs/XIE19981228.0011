Likud Lawmaker Challenges Netanyahu for Leadership
JERUSALEM , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- A Likud legislator declared his candidacy Sunday for the party 's leadership , adding fresh internal pressure to embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who is already facing enormous challenges from outside his party .
Uzi Landau , a hard-line member of the Knesset , or parliament , announced that he will run against Netanyahu as party leader , vowing to return the Likud to political and public norms which he said were paralysed in the last few years .
This move came soon after Netanyahu was relieved to hear the popular Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert announcing he would not stand for the Likud leadership as widely speculated .
Netanyahu has already faced enough challenges from the left and the central wings .
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak and former Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak , who left the army last week to help lead a new centrist political party , will be the two most formidable rivals of Netanyahu .
Troubles abound in his own party as well .
Some members have defected and some are considering to leave or challenge Netanyahu from inside , as Landau did .
Former Finance Minister Dan Meridor kicked off his campaign last week for the coming elections by quitting the Likud and announcing plans to form a centrist party , which Shahak is expected to join .
Reports said Knesset member Benny Begin and Communications Minister Limor Livnat might leave the Likud Monday .
In a potential blow to Netanyahu , Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is also reportedly considering to leave the Likud and join Shahak 's new party to run against the prime minister .
Mordechai , a moderate in the Likud government , is dissatisfied with Netanyahu over his decision to suspend the last peace deal with the Palestinians .
In an attempt to persuade Mordechai to stay , Netanyahu held talks with him Sunday morning , but no results were achieved .
The Likud central committee will convene later Sunday night to decide a date for internal elections during which the party leader and its Knesset list would be decided .
