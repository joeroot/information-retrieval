Mary Ann Rafferty didn n't know she had eye problems .
`` I just wanted a new pair of frames , '' she recalls .
`` But when the doctor examined my eyes , I knew by the look on his face that something was wrong . ''
A few more tests confirmed that Rafferty had glaucoma , a disease in which too much fluid pressure builds up inside the eye and damages the optic nerve .
More than 3 million Americans have glaucoma , and 80,000 are blind because of it .
`` My whole world turned upside down , '' Rafferty says .
`` At 41 , all I could think was that I was too young to go blind . ''
Luckily , her condition was caught early enough to save most of her sight .
Two surgeries have allowed Rafferty , now 49 , to see well enough to continue working for a pharmaceutical company in Berkeley , Calif.
The best way to prevent vision loss is to get routine eye exams .
These checkups should include a dilation , in which eye drops are used to enlarge your pupils , allowing a doctor to see inside your eyes to check for signs of disease .
These screenings are especially important as you get older .
In general , you should see an ophthalmologist or optometrist every two to three years until the age of 40 .
After that , a yearly exam is advisable .
Following are the top causes of vision trouble , and what you can do about them .
& UR ; GLAUCOMA & LR ; & QL ;
What it is : This eye disease is often called `` the silent thief of the night , '' because irreversible vision loss can occur before it 's diagnosed .
As the disease gets worse , peripheral vision narrows .
Depending on the type of glaucoma , you may notice eye pain , blurry vision or headaches .
Who is at risk : People 60 or older , as well as African-Americans and those with diabetes , nearsightedness , high blood pressure or a family history of glaucoma
What you can do : Get routine eye exams .
Vision loss from glaucoma can usually be prevented through eye drops , pills and conventional or laser surgery .
Latest news : Preliminary studies suggest that regular aerobic exercise , such as biking or brisk walking , may help reduce your glaucoma risk .
& UR ; DIABETIC RETINOPATHY & LR ; & QL ;
What it is : About half of the 16 million Americans who have diabetes suffer from this disorder , and each year more than 24,000 of them go blind from it .
Diabetic retinopathy occurs when high blood-sugar levels cause tiny blood vessels to leak in the retina .
There may be no initial symptoms , but later there may be blurriness as the retina starts to swell .
Blood vessels can also bleed into the vitreous humor _ the clear , jellylike substance that makes up the center of the eye _ and cause vision loss .
Who is at risk : Diabetics and those at risk for diabetes , including African-Americans , pregnant women , overweight people and those with high blood pressure .
What you can do : To prevent diabetes , stay slim and exercise .
A yearly eye dilation can also help detect diabetes at its earliest and most treatable stage .
If you already have diabetes , monitor your blood sugar carefully .
Eat right , exercise and take your medicine _ most cases of blindness from diabetes can be prevented .
Latest news : To slow vision loss , laser surgery is often used to seal off leaking blood vessels .
Advanced cases may be helped by a vitrectomy , in which a blood-soaked vitreous humor is replaced with a clear solution .
& UR ; MACULAR DEGENERATION & LR ; & QL ;
What it is : A progressive eye disorder that affects the macula _ the center area of the retina _ causing central vision to become blurry or distorted .
There are two types of age-related macular degeneration : `` dry '' and `` wet . ''
The dry form , which accounts for 90 percent of cases , occurs when macular tissue thins as a result of aging .
The wet form , however , is more serious and can cause sudden vision loss .
It occurs when new blood vessels grow and leak fluids behind the retina , creating blind spots .
Who is at risk : Anyone over age 65 , or who has a family history of the disease .
Scientists have recently identified a gene that may account for as many as 16 percent of AMD cases .
Other possible risk factors include a high-fat diet and smoking .
What you can do : While there is no cure for AMD , some patients with the wet form benefit from laser surgery to seal off leaking blood vessels .
Latest news : Scientists are looking into whether antioxidant supplements , such as vitamins C , E and bela-carotene , and minerals such as zinc can slow down the disease .
And researchers have recently found that a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor causes new blood vessels to grow in the retina .
They hope to find drugs to counter its effects .
& UR ; CATARACT & LR ; & QL ;
What it is : A condition in which the eye 's lens gradually loses its clarity .
This clouding prevents the lens from bringing light into focus .
Early on , there may be no noticeable symptoms .
But as the disease progresses , vision will get blurry or distorted .
You may also become more sensitive to light , and colors may look dull .
Who is at risk : Everyone will get cataracts if they live long enough .
In fact , more than half of Americans ages 65 and older have some form of the disorder .
While it isn n't clear what causes the condition , one recent study found that smoking 20 or more cigarettes a day triples your risk of early cataracts .
What you can do : `` Surgery is the only proven way to treat cataracts , '' says Dr. Richard E. Braunstein , assistant clinical professor of ophthalmology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York .
It 's also very effective : More than 90 percent of patients who have the procedure , in which a cloudy lens is replaced by a clear artificial one , improve their vision .
Latest news : Research shows that vitamin C may have a protective effect .
In one study , women who took as much as 250 milligrams of the supplement a day for 10 years or more experienced 77 percent fewer cases of early cataracts .
Estrogen-replacement therapy in postmenopausal women may also delay the onset of cataracts .
& UR ; REFRACTIVE DISORDERS & LR ; & QL ;
What they are : Visual disorders that occur when the lens and cornea do not bend light properly .
For instance , nearsightedness , also called myopia , makes it difficult to see distant objects .
Farsightedness , or hyperopia , makes it tough to see close objects .
Astigmatism occurs when the eye can n't focus because its cornea is misshapen .
Who is at risk : Nearsightedness often hits in grade school , gets worse during the teens , then stabilizes until age 40 .
Farsightedness often strikes after 40 .
What you can do : Get glasses or contact lenses .
Or consider refractive surgery , in which the cornea is reshaped with a surgical instrument , laser or both .
The average cost is about $ 2,000 per eye .
In radial keratotomy , tiny incisions are made in the cornea to correct nearsightedness .
A similar technique is used in astigmatic keratotomy to treat astigmatism .
Latest news : Photo-refractive keratectomy surgery _ in which a laser is used to correct nearsightedness , farsightedness or an astigmatism _ has become more popular in the last two years .
Nearsightedness or astigmatism may also be helped by a newer procedure , laser in-situ keratomileusis , done with a surgical instrument and a laser .
While 75 percent of patients will be able to see without glasses , perfect vision is not guaranteed , says Dr. Ernest W. Kornmehl , a refractive surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston .
Depending on the procedure , some people may become more sensitive to the light .
In rare cases , vision loss occurs .
But most patients are pleased with the results .
`` PRK changed my life , '' says former contact-lens wearer Barbara Murphy of Mineola , N.Y .
`` I forgot how great it is to wake up and be able to see on my own . ''
