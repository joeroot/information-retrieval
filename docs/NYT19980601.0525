( For use by clients of the New York Times News Service ) How Firms Can Keep Pace With Technology By Tom Abate c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle When I ran a typesetting business in the 1980s , one of my worries was figuring out what technology to buy to keep pace with the changes in the industry .
The best advice I ever got on that score literally walked in my front door one day , when a trio of local inventors showed me an interface that plugged a PC into our typesetting machine .
For a trivial cost , their invention more than doubled the amount of text our machines could pump out .
Thanks to that little gadget , our mom-and-pop shop was able to compete with big type shops nationwide for book and newsletter contracts .
Because most firms can n't count on having dream technologies walk up and grab their lapels , I 'd like to suggest some strategies for small businesses to figure out how to make their operations more tech-savvy .
_ & UR ; Stay Accessible : & LR ; Technology and computers are not synonymous .
Many small firms _ especially one-person or home-based businesses _ can get their best payback by investing in phones .
When customers call , they want you now .
Answering services , pagers and cell phones are just the start .
Maybe you need a service that forwards calls from your `` headquarters '' to a cell phone .
The faster you can handle queries , the happier your customers will be .
And that has to be the first order of business .
_ & UR ; FREE expert advice : & LR ; If you can n't afford to hire a management-consulting firm , you can still get free advice from business school students who one day will become high-priced consultants .
Every fall and spring , the University of California at Berkeley 's Haas School of Business sends graduate students out to help businesses with every problem imaginable .
Program director Stephanie Tibbetts said these grad student interns can help small firms modernize or revamp the way they do business .
For details , see her Web site : & LR ; http : / & LR ; & LR ; / haas.berkeley.edu / lester / bsg.html & LR ; .
California State University at Hayward and San Francisco State University both offer similar programs .
At CSU Hayward , contact Ron Feldman through e-mail at & LR ; BIZAMERICA & LR ; aol.com .

Rich McCline does the matchmaking at S.F .
State .
He 's reachable by phone at ( 415 ) 338 - 7886 or e-mail at & LR ; rmccline & LR ; sfsu.edu .

In the cheap-but-not-quite-free category is the Corporation for Manufacturing Excellence in Fremont .
It can help you completely overhaul your widget-making operations .
Call AnnMarie Winslow at ( 510 ) 249 - 1480 for information .
_ & UR ; Your tax dollars at work & LR ; : The Small Business Administration funds six Small Business Development Centers around the Bay Area .
Elza Minor runs the Sunnyvale office at ( 408 ) 736 - 0680 ) .

_ & UR ; Trade publications help : & LR ; There is one form of advice that & LR ; can & LR ; walk in your door .
Every trade has its trade publications .
They vary in quality , but all try to show you how technology is being employed in your line of work .
Attend trade shows and conventions .
Having been a business owner , I know it 's easy to say you 're too busy or that they 're too expensive .
But these trips are probably the best investments you can make in the future of your business .
Besides , don n't they usually hold trade shows in great locales _ where your expenses are iron-clad deductions ?
