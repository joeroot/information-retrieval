Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to " Dissidents " in China ( 1 )
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Editor 's Note : Some members of the media and people in the United States and other western nations have frequently used the word " dissidents " when referring to anti-government individuals intent on harming state security .
They have also attacked China 's lawful punishment of criminals as infringements on human rights .
" An Open Letter to ' Dissidents ' in China " written by Liu Jiahua , a Chinese national now residing in the United States , uses both theories and facts to analyze the western concept of so-called " Chinese dissidents " .
Liu points out that the western concept does not refer to Chinese people holding different political opinions , but instead to anti-government personages engaged in subversive activities against the legitimate government of China .
He also points out that anyone engaged in anti-government activities in any country is subject to punishment according to law .
Following is the full text of Liu 's letter : " Dissidents " in China ,
First I should explain that I believe it 's somewhat inappropriate to call you " dissidents " because the word " dissident , " which derives from the English word " dissent , " originally referred to people who refused to believe in the state religion of their country .
As since there is no state religion in China , there shouldn n't be any " dissidents " either .
So I believe that " Chinese dissidents " is a slanderous term used by the Western media .
It 's better to call you " anti-government personages " because in your eyes the existing Chinese government is against freedom , democracy and human rights and should be opposed , while the United States gives its people freedom and democracy and pays respect to human rights .
So what you 're pursuing is to reform China in the American way , just as some rightists in the U.S. government claim : the democratic system of the U.S. should be promoted in every corner of the world to enable people of all countries to enjoy the magnificent life of capitalism .
