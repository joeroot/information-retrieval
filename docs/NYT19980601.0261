REV .
RIVERS HAS SAVVY , THAT 'S FOR SURE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By PATRICIA SMITH c.1998 The Boston Globe
What does it take to be larger than life ?
In the case of the Rev. Eugene Rivers , it takes an inborn savvy that is both manipulative and heartfelt .
It 's picking exactly the wrong battles with exactly the wrong people , realizing that winning is secondary to dogged persistence and a display of arrogance that both infuriates and disables his adversaries .
It is , will wonders ever cease , the gall and guts to actually defend a headline renaming Harvard 's Henry Louis Gates Jr. `` Head Negro in Charge . ''
It is almost singlehandedly ripping a community down its ideological middle ; important issues of the day are relegated to the backdrop while the topic of debate becomes _ what else ?
_ Eugene Rivers .
It also doesn n't hurt the Reverend Rivers to have his painfully earnest mug plastered on the front of the June 1 issue of Newsweek .
Whoa , there he is , staring from the magazine rack at Store 24 , glaring the gospel from the crowded shelves at Out of Town News and lined up , row upon row of righteousness , on the rack of any periodicals purveyor worth its salt .
It won n't be long , of course , before another tragedy , world leader or pressing issue replaces him on the coveted cover .
But right now , it is Rivers 's turn to flow .
He is the undisputed star of the show .
The reverend , as expected , gives incredibly good face _ his immaculately groomed head , which seems bigger than the average head somehow , floats above a stark-white clerical collar .
His eyes are simultaneously world-weary , hopeful , reverent , angry , and stubborn .
He is playing shamelessly to the camera .
You can almost hear him thinking , `` Boy , the folks in Boston are gon na love this ! ''
knowing full well that quite a few of them will not .
Already , one Rivers detractor has put the cover to good use .
`` Makes a great dartboard , '' he snips .
The headline beneath the head clues us in as to what Rivers is spouting off about this time : `` God Vs .
Gangs '' `` What 's the Hottest Idea in Crime Fighting ? ''
And then , the answer , as if the clerical collar wasn n't already screaming it : `` The Power of Religion . ''
It 's a noble topic , to be sure , and maybe one day someone at Newsweek will venture to write about it .
But this puff piece is unabashedly in love with the Reverend Rivers .
Read about his derring-do in staring down local gangbangers in order to mark his territory !
Thrill to his cutting-edge criticism of the black church and , not surprisingly , Henry Louis Gates Jr. !
Read his life story !
See him work the streets , pray , get his hair cut !
Agree wholeheartedly when a Boston police lieutenant , reflecting on Rivers 's mix of frayed rhetoric , wan na be Havard Yard and last week 's street lingo , admits `` I don n't understand him . ''
Granted , the descriptions of the philosophy and goings-on at Rivers 's Ella J. Baker House hint at a revolution in the pockmarked history of fighting juvenile crime .
But there is not one born-again street child quoted , no chronicle of a life turned around .
Whenever the piece seems headed in that longed-for direction , the words whiz right back around to Rivers , as if he alone is the nationally designated dreamer .
The inside headline has anointed him : `` Savior of the Streets . ''
That 's in tune with the prevailing local criticism of the reverend , which is that he has overcome a lukewarm stature in the black community to present himself as its official spokesman on everything from crime statistics to stupid headlines .
He 's good for a quick sound bite , analysis of a trend or the directions to a good soul food restaurant .
When they need to take the temperature of the inner city , white Boston shoves the thermometer into Gene Rivers 's mouth .
Now , thanks to Newsweek , he 's gone global .
For the record , `` God vs. Gangs '' is nothing new .
For years , black mamas have defied the lure of the streets and dragged their sons by the ears right to the preacher 's door .
I remember one formidable matriarch who shook a fist at her wayward child in front of the entire Sunday congregation .
She had quite obviously reached the end of her rope .
`` Jesus , you better take him and get him to the promised land , '' she warned , pushing her son toward the pulpit .
`` 'Cause if you don n't , I got my own way of gettin ' him there . ''
As long as there has been trouble , there have been neighborhood prayer circles and fervent testimonials of street toughs who once were blind but now they see .
God has been a quiet , unassuming success .
Even in the days when crime stats painted a more dismal picture , there were souls being saved .
The power of spirit is new now because Newsweek points to Gene Rivers and Gene Rivers says it is .
And the kids in the midst of all this ?
They 're mere bit players , standing by as a great big important magazine screams `` Lights !
Camera !
Action ! ''
and handpicks them a hero .
