Japan 's Trade Surplus Climbs 25 Percent in August
TOKYO , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Japan 's merchandise trade surplus in August rose by 24.7 percent from a year earlier to 896.7 billion yen ( about 6.3 billion U.S. dollars ) as increasing exports overwhelmed falling imports , the Finance Ministry said on Monday .
Japan 's global imports in August fell by three percent from a year before to 3,119.0 billion yen ( about 21.8 billion dollars ) , while exports rose by two percent to 4,015.7 billion yen ( about 27.9 billion dollars ) , the ministry said .
Trade surplus with the United States , its largest trade partner , soared 28.4 percent to 431.0 billion yen ( about 3.0 billion dollars ) in August , up for the 23rd consecutive month .
Japan 's surplus with Asian countries fell by 52.5 percent to 240.9 billion yen ( about 1.7 billion dollars ) due to a sharp drop in Japan 's exports to the region .
As for trade with the European Union ( EU ) , Japan 's surplus swelled 86.3 percent to 276.9 billion yen ( about 1.9 billion dollars ) .
The average foreign exchange rate used for the August report was 143.48 yen to one U.S. dollar , compared with 117.12 yen a year earlier .
Referring to the August trade report , an economist at a private financial institution said a trade spat between Tokyo and Washington could flare up in the near future .
Noting that the continued growth in Japan 's trade surplus with the United States " had been hidden by a vibrant U.S. economy , " the economist said the resurgence of a bilateral trade row could occur unless the yen 's depreciation is reversed much more substantially .
