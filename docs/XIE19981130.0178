Cambodia Forms New Government
PHNOM PENH , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Cambodia 's new government was officially formed Monday after the National Assembly approved the new political platform and a cabinet led by new Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Ninety nine out of the 116 parliamentarians who attended the confidence vote of the new government voted to endorse Hun Sen as prime minister and his 82-member cabinet , while 13 voted against , three abstained and one vote was declared invalid .
Opposition Sam Rainsy Party 's 10 parliamentarians were among those who voted against .
Sam Rainsy Party lawmakers said they voted against the new government because of un-investigated election-related complaints and the lack of change between the last government and the new one .
Hun Sen , nominated by his own Cambodian People 's Party ( CPP ) for the sole premiership , was named new prime minister by King Norodom Sihanouk last Wednesday night and appointed to form a new government .
Hun Sen , who has been prime minister since 1985 , will lead a new coalition comprising two major political parties for the next five years .
The vote for the legitimacy of the government brought an end to nearly 17 months of political uncertainty prompted by the ouster of former first prime minister Prince Ranariddh in July last year .
In the new government , the CPP holds 12 ministers among 25 ministries while Prince Ranariddh 's FUNCINPEC gains 11 .
The two key ministries of defense and interior still have co-ministers .
Hor Nam Hong , senior advisor to Hun Sen and ambassador to France , was appointed minister of foreign affairs .
Sar Kheng , also a CPP member and former co-minister of interior , was named deputy prime minister while remaining as co-minister of interior with his FUNCINPEC partner You Hockry .
Prince Sisowath Sirirath , a FUNCINPEC member and ambassador to the United Nations , became co-defense minister with the CPP 's Tea Banh who has been holding the post since 1993 .
Meanwhile , CPP member Keat Chhon remains the minister of finance and economy .
Secretary General of FUNCINPEC Tol Lah became deputy prime minister while maintaining his former post of minister of education .
