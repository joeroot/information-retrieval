HK 's External Trade Continues to Decline in November
HONG KONG , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- The value of Hong Kong 's total exports and imports fell further in November , yet the year-on-year rate of decline was less marked than in October .
This was based on the external trade figures for November 1998 released Monday by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong .
The value of total exports ( comprising re-exports and domestic exports ) fell by 9.3 percent over a year earlier to 113.1 billion HK dollars ( about 14.5 billion U.S. dollars ) in November 1998 .
Of this total , the value of re-exports was down by 8.2 percent to 97.9 billion HK dollars ( about 12.6 billion U.S. dollars ) and that of domestic exports by 15.8 percent to 15.1 billion HK dollars ( about 1.9 billion U.S. dollars ) .
Concurrently , the value of imports also fell significantly , by 14.4 percent to 113.8 billion HK dollars ( 14.6 billion U.S. dollars ) .
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the reason why the export remained slack in November was mainly the plunge in import demand in Japan and in the other East Asian economies hit by the regional financial turmoil .
More recently , exports to the conventional markets such as the United States and the European Union were also affected by the moderation in their import demand .
Exports to the mainland of China continued to fall , along with the setback in its exports , the spokesman said .
