U.S. Foreign Policy in 1998 -- Global Engagement and Expansion
by Yuan Bingzhong and Li Hongqi
WASHINGTON , December 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The year of 1998 saw the United States further implement the policy of " engagement and expansion " worldwide by resorting every means , including the use of force , to dominate world affairs in an attempt to extend its s uperpower position into the 21st century .
However , as the world order is developing irreversibly towards multi-polarity , the U.S. has found it increasingly difficult to carry out its global strategy oriented towards the new century .
In recent years , the U.S. government set a strategic framework for its foreign policies for the present time or even for the next 10 to 15 years by formulating a series of important documents , such as the National Security Strategy for the New Century , the International Affairs Strategic Plan , the Quadrennial Defense Review and the 1998 East Asian-Pacific Security Strategy Report .
The U.S. strategic objective is to continue the policy of " engagement and expansion " set forth in mid-1990s .
It is designed to create an international environment favorable to itself , to strengthen its ability in reaction to major world events and to properly handle the post-Cold War security problems such as nuclear proliferation , regional conflicts , transnational crimes and environment protection .
By doing so , the U.S. hopes to secure its long-term leadership in world affairs and safeguard to the maximum extent its economic , political and security interests around the globe .
Such a global strategy decides that the U.S. foreign policy has always carried a tint of power politics , and the slump in the world economy this year has lent a helping hand to the U.S. hegemony .
At the beginning of the year , the East Asian financial crisis continued to spread and worsen as economic recession began to emerge in Russia and Japan , leading to a financial turmoil around the globe .
In contrast , the U.S. economy , although fluctuating , is still growing , heightening the U.S. ambition to dominate the world .
On the issue of weapons inspection in Iraq , the U.S. , after repeatedly threatening to use force against Iraq , finally staged large-scale air strikes without authorization from the United Nations Security Council .
Likewise , it more than once threatened to use force in Kosovo , proclaiming that NATO can take unilateral military actions without the Security Council 's permission .
In European affairs , the U.S. actively pushed the NATO 's expansion eastward to serve its own interests .
Regardless of Russia 's strong objection , the U.S. Congress in April approved a protocol that will admit Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO , a substantial step in expanding the western military alliance to the East Europe .
Earlier in the year , Washington signed the U.S . - Baltic Charter with Lithuania , Estonia and Lat via to bring them under the shield of the western security system .
The Middle East , a strategic region of the Eurasian continent , is regarded by the U.S. as a place of great interests .
Other than political factors at home , America 's wish to continue to contain Iraq and maintain its control over Persian oil and the strategic passage in the region constituted the main reasons for the U.S. to put pressure on Iraq and then waged a war against it .
The U.S. took the initiative on the issue of Palestini an-Israeli peace talks and succeeded in brokering an agreement between the two rivals on the second phase of Israel 's withdrawal from the occupied land .
But the objectives remain the same , either by war or brokering peace , that is , to maintain the U.S. lo ng-term strategic interests in the region .
In East Asia , the U.S. further expanded its engagement with China while increasing security cooperation with Japan and South Korea .
After India and Pakistan challenged the U.S. non-proliferation policy by conducting nuclear tests one after another , the U.S. adjusted its Asian-Pacific strategy by attaching greater importance to the Sino-U.S. relations .
President Bill Clinton 's visit to China this year marked a step forward to establish a " constructive strategic partnership " with China .
In Africa , American policies also underwent constant adjustment .
Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit Africa in 20 years when he toured six African nations in the year .
Though the U.S. intensified its involvement in global affairs in 1998 , the growing multi-polarity put immense challenges to it .
First , instead of solving the weapons inspection crisis , the U.S. air strikes against Iraq created a more complicated situation .
The U.S. met widespread condemnation from the international community after resorting to force against another country without the Security Council 's authorization .
Secondly , on security issues , the U.S. and its western allies have both coordination and cooperation and disputes with each oth e r.
Major Western European nations objected the U.S. request for NATO to more actively engage in non-proliferation and peace-keeping actions .
Besides , the U.S. saw increased trade conflicts with the European nations and Japan in 1998 .
The emerging European Monetary Union will inevitably stimulate the Europeans ' desire to step out of the shadow of their big brother in the new century , diminishing the America 's role as a world leader .
Thirdly , more and more countries feel resentful against the U.S. move to station troops overseas , behave as " international police " and impose its own economic systems and values on others .
In short , the U.S. foreign policies are still in the process of adjustment while the the three factors will significantly restrain its effort to fulfil the global strategy .
It 's predictable that , with the world heading towards multi-polarity , any attempt to dominate the world would end up in failure .
