COUP CHARGES AGAINST FORMER ZAMBIAN LEADER DROPPED

JOHANNESBURG , South Africa _ Kenneth Kaunda , the former president of Zambia , was set free on Monday after prosecutors dropped charges that he had a role in a botched coup attempt last year .
Kaunda , who led Zambia to independence from Britain and ruled it for 27 years , had been in jail or under house arrest for nearly six months , barred from speaking to his supporters or the media .
He was apparently released released in Lusaka , the Zambian capital , as part of a deal brokered by President Nelson Mandela of South Africa , whom he thanked in brief remarks on the steps of the courthouse while hundreds of cheering supporters crowded around him .
The case against Kaunda had always appeared weak .
Two weeks ago , Mandela sent his defense minister to Zambia on a shuttle diplomacy mission between Kaunda and Zambia 's President Frederick Chiluba , a South African government representative said .
No one would officially disclose details of the deal , but it is said to include Kaunda 's agreement to retire from politics permanently .
He said at the courthouse on Monday that `` nothing can stop me '' from pursuing his campaign against Chiluba .
But in a later speech outside the headquarters of his United National Independence Party , he said he was calling a party congress to elect a new leader .
Kaunda was arrested on Christmas Day and accused of being behind a brief coup on Oct. 28 in which army officers led by a `` Captain Solo '' invaded the house of the army chief of staff and the national radio station .
The officers declared that they ran the country and that Chiluba had until 9 a.m. to surrender or be killed .
No troops rallied to their cause , and three hours later they were arrested after a brief gun battle .
The first reports were that it had been a drunken foray by a few captains and majors unhappy about living in poverty while generals enjoyed generous perks .
However , Chiluba quickly declared a state of emergency and started rounding up his political opponents .
Kaunda was in South Africa on a lecture tour but was arrested soon after he returned .
Another opposition leader , Rodger Chongwe , who was wounded with Kaunda last August when the police opened fire on their car at a political rally , is in Australia , fearing arrest if he returns .
About 80 people still face charges in the coup plot , and human rights groups say that several people , including another opposition leader , Dean Mungomba , have been tortured in jail .
Some , including Capt. Steven Lungu , the erstwhile `` Captain Solo , '' face the death penalty .
Kaunda 's lawyer , Sakwiba Sikota , said on Monday that the release was `` a bit of a letdown . ''
`` We 'd come this far , we were ready for trial and we wanted to prove his innocence , '' he said .
Under Zambian law , the prosecution reserved the right to resurrect the charges later , but Sikota said that `` seemed unlikely . ''
The government 's case against Kaunda became progressively weaker after his arrest .
The only evidence it made public against him was an interview he gave shortly before the coup in which he said there would soon be `` an explosion '' in Zambia .
In February , the charge against him was reduced from plotting the coup to concealing knowledge of the plot .
The South African government declined publicly to confirm Mandela 's role but expressed its happiness over the release .
South Africa has longstanding ties to Kaunda .
At considerable risk of attack by apartheid South Africa , he allowed the African National Congress to keep its headquarters in Lusaka while it was in exile .

Kaunda and Chiluba are engaged in a bitter personal feud .
Kaunda locked up many dissenters under his own one-party state , but after pressure from the West allowed a slow transition to democracy .
Decades of low copper prices and mismanagement of the economy impoverished the country , however , and Chiluba , a trade unionist Kaunda had once jailed , defeated him in multiparty elections in 1991 .
Chiluba quickly shifted economic policy to aggressive capitalism , cutting food subsidies and selling state-owned companies .
But things soon went sour .
Layoffs and price increases hurt the poorest Zambians .
Cabinet members were accused of corruption and drug-dealing and his multiparty coalition broke up .
His attacks on Kaunda 's legacy so angered the former president that he came out of retirement to oppose Chiluba in 1996 .
Chiluba pushed through a constitutional amendment barring Kaunda from running , which prompted Western donors to temporarily cut off badly needed assistance .
He won re-election , but the election was widely considered rigged .
Since then the two have lost no opportunity to attack each other in speeches and to spread disinformation through sympathetic newspapers .
