A Justice Department official met with FBI and other law enforcement officials in Salt Lake City today , probing into the accusations that the Utah bid committee offered scholarships and other favors to buy the votes of International Olympic Committee members .
It was said the preliminary review had focused on possible extortion and tax and wire fraud .
The U.S. Olympic Committee appointed a five-member panel led by George Mitchell .
" I believe the Olympic movement holds a special place in the hearts and minds of Americans and people around the world , " Mitchell said .
" We intend to investigate what happend in the past and make recommendation to assure that the selection of U.S. candidate cities for further Olympics is fair and above reproach . "
Mitchell said his panel would cooperate with the other investigations and would turn over any evidence of criminal wrongdoings to prosecutors .
The USOC said that American cities bidding for future Olympics and Pan American Games must abide by a 25-page set of ethics guidelines " that say what you can and what you can not do . "
