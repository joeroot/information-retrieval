WINGS SIDER-TEX WINGS SAY STARS ` DESERVED TO WIN ' ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ C.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
DETROIT _ The broad smile that ran across the face of Red Wings defenseman Jamie Macoun was about the only one visible in the Detroit dressing room after Friday night 's game with the Dallas Stars .
Macoun 's good feeling was understandable : in the second period he scored what proved to be the winning goal .
But most Red Wings players were far more subdued , calling themselves fortunate to escape with a 5 - 3 victory after blowing a seemingly untouchable 4 - 0 lead .
`` We were lucky tonight , '' said forward Martin Lapointe , who shattered the Stars ' comeback hopes with the fifth Detroit goal .
`` We let them back in \Rthe game\S .
It 's a lesson : When you go up four-nothing in the playoffs , you can n't let up . ''
Lapointe said Detroit `` Sat back a little '' after scoring early and often .
`` A lot of the adrenaline goes down , '' he added .
On the plus side , `` We never panicked , '' Lapointe said .
Veteran defenseman Larry Murphy also was hardly jubilant .
`` They outshot us badly the whole game , '' Murphy said .
The Stars had 34 shots on goalie Chris Osgood , to the Red Wings ' 20 on Ed Belfour .
Murphy 's reaction to Lapointe 's goal with about four minutes to play ?
`` That was a huge sigh of relief , '' he said .
Even Macoun 's thrilling moment was somewhat blunted .
Of his goal , he said , `` I didn n't realize it was going to be as important as it was .
`` In the first half of the game we got some lucky bounces and ended up being up four to nothing , '' Macoun said .
`` We probably didn n't deserve to be up four to nothing , and the second half of the game ended up indicating where the game was going . ''
Macoun was impressed with the Stars ' effort after falling so far behind .
`` They 've been the best team in the league all year long and tonight they showed why , '' he said .
`` Tonight was a very important game and they smelled blood .
They realized , for whatever reason , that we weren n't clicking tonight . ''
Red Wings players were at a loss to explain why they weren n't on their game .
`` The effort was there but the passes were off a little bit and we were doing plays that just didn n't work out , '' Macoun said .
Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman said that his team was off form , but that he didn n't feel they had let up on the Stars after getting the big lead .
`` Overall , I didn n't think we were as sharp as we have been , '' Bowman said .
`` I don n't think we tried to be careful , we just lost our focus a little bit . ''
Said Macoun : `` The players and the fans all want to have a nice easy game .
We were up four to nothing , but maybe we shouldn n't have been .
Dallas probably deserved to win tonight , to be honest with you .
I 'm sure they 're thinking they should have won . ''
