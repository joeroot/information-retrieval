People 's Daily On Central Bank 's New Reform Moves
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- People 's Daily , China 's leading newspaper , comments in Monday 's edition on the central bank 's tightening of financial controls as its latest reform measures .
In a commentary titled " A Major Reform in the Administrative Structure of the Central Bank " , it says that the decision to replace provincial-level branches of the People 's Bank of China ( PBOC ) with regional ones is " an important step forward in the current financial reform " .
From 1948 to 1984 , it says , the PBOC played a role of both central administrator of the financial sector and commercial bank doing banking with enterprises and individuals .
Since 1984 , it has preserved its administrative functions.But the decades-old practice of PBOC branches with parallel administrative functions has remained unchanged and continues to hamper the work of the central bank as the policy-implementor and financial administrator , the paper says .
It says that increasing financial reforms , setting up a system that adjusts and controls the financial sector that is adapted to developing a socialist market economy , preventing financial hazards , and pushing for sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy are significant changes and that this accords with the country 's own situation and the international practices as well .
