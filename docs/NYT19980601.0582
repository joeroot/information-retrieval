Three former managers at MCI International in Piscataway , N.J . , pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges of accepting $ 312,000 in kickbacks from companies seeking to do business with the company .
John Vicari , 45 , of Marlboro , N.J . , former senior manager of information technology ; Richard Thies , 55 , of Randolph , N.J . , who was director of operations ; and John Mastromarino , 58 , of Spotswood , N.J . , former senior manager of network operations , admitted that between 1990 and 1995 they had accepted the money from three vendors of office supplies and security and computer consulting services in exchange for contracts with the company , a unit of MCI Communications Corp. , the United States ' second-largest long-distance telephone company .
Thies also pleaded guilty to defrauding MCI of $ 250,000 by paying for computer products and services the company did not receive .
Vicari told Judge Katherine Hayden in U.S. District Court in Newark , N.J . , that he received more than $ 180,000 in the scheme .
Mastromarino admitted receiving $ 60 , 000 .
Three more MCI officials , including a vice president , were also involved in the scheme , according to court papers .
Alain Liebman , an assistant U.S. attorney , declined to say whether the other MCI executives or the vendors would also be charged , but he added that he expected additional proceedings Wednesday concerning the case .
Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 10 .
Vicari faces up to 10 years in federal prison and $ 500,000 in fines ; Thies faces eight years and $ 500 , 000 , and Mastromarino three years and $ 250 , 000 , Liebman said .
`` We 're pleased that justice is served , '' MCI said in a statement .
`` In this case , MCI was the victim of the crime .
MCI paid for products and services which we never received . ''
