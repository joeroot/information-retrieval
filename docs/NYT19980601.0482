WASHINGTON : not great .
Background
From 1990 , Aid Rose to Highest in Region
Since the end of the Cold War and the waning of civil conflicts elsewhere , Colombia has emerged as the largest recipient of U.S. military assistance in the Western hemisphere .
The aid began to rise in 1990 , with the Bush administration 's `` Andean strategy , '' a five-year , $ 2.2 billion plan to try to stop the cocaine plague at its source .
U.S. officials believed that with global security threats shifting after the Soviet Union 's demise , soldiers and intelligence agents could find a worthy new adversary in the bosses of Colombia 's cocaine trade .
And as such efforts gathered momentum in the early 1990s , they focused largely on the bosses themselves .
The expanding U.S. role also coincided with a turn in the region 's oldest guerrilla war .
Starting in 1990 , several guerrilla groups agreed finally to lay down their arms .
Some 7,000 more , mostly of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( known by its initials in Spanish as the FARC ) and the National Liberation Army , rejected the peace .
Cesar Gaviria , then Colombia 's president , attacked the holdouts as `` deranged fanatics who have not read in the newspapers the sorry story of the end of communist totalitarianism . ''
Confident that history was on his side , he doubled military spending and increased the size and authority of the armed forces .
The guerrillas and their supporters also came under new assault by right-wing paramilitary forces that often worked with government troops .
In many cases , drug traffickers have also armed the paramilitaries against the insurgents ; victims of the squads have included thousands of peasants and unionists , and hundreds of the rebels who gave up their guns .
By the mid-1990s , the remaining insurgents had dug in militarily and begun shoring up their finances .
They stepped up ransom kidnappings , extortion and the protection of coca fields , jungle laboratories and clandestine airstrips .
The collaboration of some guerrilla fronts with the drug trade became the central plank of government propaganda campaigns against them .
It also began to emerge as a justification for the difficulty that officials had in keeping U.S. aid from going to Colombian units that fought mainly against the insurgents .
`` They 're guarding drugs , they 're moving drugs , they 're growing drugs , '' the White House drug-policy director , Gen. Barry McCaffrey , said in 1996 , adding that he was `` uneasy '' with U.S. efforts to restrict Colombia 's use of advanced UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that it was then buying from the United States .
`` They 're a narco-guerrilla force , period . ''
Beginning in 1994 , Congress required the Clinton administration to verify that U.S. military aid would go only to troops that `` primarily '' carried out anti-drug operations .
In March 1996 , the administration reacted to evidence that President Ernesto Samper had taken money from Cali traffickers , by cutting off almost all U.S. aid to Colombia except what was designated to fight drugs , a step known as decertification .
Yet according to many officials , the Pentagon quietly distinguished itself by finding creative ways around the restrictions .
`` We refused to disengage , '' said a Defense official who spoke on the condition that he not be identified .
Over all , U.S. anti-drug aid granted to the Colombian military and police rose from $ 28.8 million in 1995 to at least $ 95.9 million in 1997 , according to State Department figures .
Military sales to Colombia jumped from $ 21.9 million to $ 75 million over the same period , largely on the Colombian army 's purchase of the six Blackhawks .
Unlike the early stages of the civil war in El Salvador , when whole battalions were flown to U.S. bases for training , the Pentagon 's efforts to overhaul Colombian forces have been conducted mainly in Colombia by small teams of special-forces trainers .
Administration officials describe the curriculum as heavy doses of anti-drug tactics with some counterterrorism , hostage rescue and medical training thrown in .
But military officials familiar with the programs said they concentrate less on weak links in the cocaine trade than on shortcomings of the Colombian army .
One instance of the vague definition of `` counter drug '' preparation are the courses that U.S. Army trainers , drawn largely from the 7th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg , N.C . , often lead in the Pentagon 's Joint Combined Exchange Training , or J-Cet program .
Working with Colombian units , Defense Department officials said , the teams teach skills as basic as marksmanship and jungle maneuvers .
At the end of a course , the trainers will typically plan a `` graduation '' attack on the guerrillas and then wait at their base while the students carry it out .
Another program , Joint Planning Assistance and Training , often involves the preparation of psychological operations against guerrillas and drug traffickers .
Still other teams analyze military intelligence information to help the Colombian army to plan its operations .
U.S. officials do not deny that many of the Colombian units they train go back into battle against the rebels .
The Colombian army has no forces dedicated entirely to fighting drugs , and the use of U.S . - trained troops is left up to Colombian commanders .
By 1994 , both the General Accounting Office and the Defense Department had found that the light-infantry skills taught in anti-drug training were easily adapted to fighting the rebels .
When the U.S. Embassy in Bogota reviewed the matter in 1994 , officials said they discovered that anti-drug aid had gone to seven Colombian brigades and seven battalions that had been implicated in abuses or linked to right-wing paramilitary groups that had killed civilians .
Conditions subsequently imposed by Congress sought to cut off aid to any Colombian units involved in human-rights violations .
But some U.S . - trained forces have continued to be accused of abuses , and Colombian prosecutors are investigating reports that a massacre of suspected rebel sympathizers last year around the southern village of Mapiripan was carried out by a paramilitary squad flown into the nearby military air field at San Jose de Guaviare , the staging base for U.S . - supported anti-drug operations in the region .
