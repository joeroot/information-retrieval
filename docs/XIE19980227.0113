Australian Tourism Industry Hit by Asian Crisis
CANBERRA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The slowdown in international visitor arrivals from Asia is continuing to hit the Australian tourism industry , threatening investor confidence and job security across the nation , an Australian official said in a statement Friday .
Chief Executive Officer of the Tourism Task Force ( TTF ) Christopher Brown said : " However , we draw some hope from the continued attraction in the United States , Europe and New Zealand . "
Preliminary data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) showed that the tourists from South Korea reduced by about 80 percent in January to 6,500 compared with 30,800 in January 1997 .
The tourists from Thailand also dramatically dropped - falling 30 percent to 3,300 in January compared with 4,700 in the same month last year .
Tourist numbers from Indonesia reduced marginally ( one percent ) to 10100 in January from 10200 last January , which may have been falsely boosted by holiday-makers coming to Australia during Ramadan .
TCA Managing Director Bruce Baird cautioned the full impact of the Asian financial crisis could not be determined on December and January figures alone , but would emerge over several months .
Although there was a slight increase in overall January visitor arrivals from Southeast Asia , the boost was skewed by an influx of tourists to Australia for Chinese New Year with tourists from Singapore alone increasing 85 percent from 8600 to 15 , 900 , he added .
