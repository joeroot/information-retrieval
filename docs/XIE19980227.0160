Trading Human Body Organs Illegal , Official
HAIKOU , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Any form of trade in human organs is in direct violation of Chinese law and is strictly prohibited by the Chinese Government , according to a leading government official .
The official from south China 's Hainan Province cited the futility of creating fraudulent accusations and fabricating false stories about the transplantation of organs removed from prisoners executed in China .
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua , the official responded to a report in the American media that Wang Chengyong has been charged with alledgedly attempting to sell in the United States organs removed from executed Chinese prisoners .
The official noted that Wang served as a deputy chief of the Hainan Branch No.2 Criminal and Procuratorial Division under the Hainan Provincial People 's Procuratorate , in February 1996 .
However , he resigned in March that same year , citing the the low income level
The Hainan Provincial People 's Procuratorate approved Wang 's resignation in June 1996 , and issued a notice clearly stating : " After his resignation , Wang Chengyong will no longer be associated with the procuratorate in any form or manner . "
The official stressed that Hainan 's judicial departments have had no contact with Wang since his resignation .
He said that Wang applied to the public security department for an exit visa to visit relatives in Thailand during the first half of 1996 .
He later departed the country carrying a private business passport .
Medical institutions in Hainan Province have never engaged in any form of cooperation with foreign counterparts and personnel in the transplantation of human organs .
The Hainan Provincial Customs Office has never detected or had a due cause to investigate a case involving the illegal shipment of human bodies to foreign countries .
The official strongly reiterated that any form of trade in human organs is strictly against related Chinese law and is prohibited by the Chinese Government .
He continued by saying that for the purpose of treating sick people and terminally ill patients , and in accordance with relevant provisions , medical units , public health departments and related research institutes are permitted to use organs of executed prisoners under strict conditions in which either the prisoner voluntarily affixes his or her signature or his or her relatives grant approval to his or her organ donation .
However , all related donations are subject to strict examinations and must obtain the approval by relevant public health administrative and judicial departments , according to the official .
The same procedure applies to other Chinese citizens who voluntarily donate their body organs to medical units , public health departments or research institutes following their death .
The official pointed out that Harry Wu fabricated a rumor several years ago that a Chinese hospital was transplanting the kidneys of an executed prisoner .
Surgeons were , in fact , operating on a patient with severe heart disease .
Later , Wu publicly admitted that he had fabricated the report .
The official said he had noticed some media reports said that " Harry Wu who disguised himself as a customer then mentioned of his own accord trade in body organs of citizens on the Chinese mainland , " and " This could possibly be a trap . "
The official stressed that it will be futile to create fraud by fabricating stories regarding the transplantation of the body organs of executed Chinese prisoners .
