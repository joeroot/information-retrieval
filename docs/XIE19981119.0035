Zambia Calls for Free Trade in Southern Africa
LUSAKA , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs of Zambia Wednesday urged the Southern Africa Customs Unions ( SACU ) to accept the principle of free and fair trade .
Committee chairman Vernon Mwaanga said here that it is greatly concerned over the delay in finalizing an agreement between Zambia and SACU , which groups Swaziland , Lesotho , Namibia , Botswana and South Africa .
When Mwaanga presented the Committee 's report on foreign affairs to be adopted by the house , he said the committee wants SACU to finalize the agreement with Zambia without any further delay so that SACU market can be opened to Zambian goods .
Zambia has reached the trade agreement with SACU but SACU member countries have yet to sign and ratify the agreement .
Mwaanga also said that Zambia needs to market itself globally to attract more investment if it has to survive in the face of declining donor aid .
Zambia should start looking to regions like Asia and the Middle East for a new scope of the country 's economic growth , he said .
Seconding the motion to adopt the report , independent parliament member Alexis Luhila called for more funding to Zambian missions abroad .
He pointed out that the missions can not promote foreign policy if they are not adequately funded .
He also urged the government to open a mission in Latin America to attract investment .
