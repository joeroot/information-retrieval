ASEAN Finance Ministers to Discuss Use of Regional
JAKARTA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The second ASEAN Finance Ministers Meeting scheduled here for Saturday will discuss the issue of using regional currencies in an intra-ASEAN trading system , a Thai official said .
" It is the newest issue , " Chairman of Thailand 's delegation Sommai Phasee said after attending the second ASEAN senior finance officials meeting here Friday .
However , he could not say whether the idea would be finalized at Saturday 's meeting , saying that " it is being studied and debated . "
The topic of using regional currencies in a trading system between member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) has yet to be finalized .
The idea was proposed at the ASEAN leaders meeting in Kuala Lumpur last December .
ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , the Philippines , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam .
So far , Malaysia , the Philippines and Thailand have agreed to initially test the innovative scheme .
Intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies instead of the U.S. dollar is one of the strategies which members of the 30-year-old organization plan to implement to control the financial crisis in Asia .
The finance ministers of the nine-member regional grouping will also talk about general issues concerning the economic turmoil that has swept the region since mid-July last year , he said .
The regional economic woes , first triggered by the depreciation of Thailand 's baht in mid-1997 , have led to significant devaluation of many ASEAN currencies .
Secretary General of the Indonesian Finance Ministry Dono Iskandar Djojosubroto said the ministers will also discuss the decisions of the special ASEAN Finance Ministerial Meeting on December 1 , 1997 in Kuala Lumpur , including the status of the ASEAN surveillance mechanism and the establishment of a surveillance secretariat .
Other agenda items include reports on the implementation of Manila framework and the development of an Asian bond market , Dono said .
