CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGNS TARGET LATINO ELECTORATE

LOS ANGELES _ Republican or Democrat ?
David Haro of North Hollywood isn n't quite sure which he wants to be yet .
But with the primary election coming up Tuesday , he is feeling pressure from all sides .
Volunteer Connie Begg coaxed him in Spanish to register to vote as a Republican at a Los Angeles Convention Center naturalization ceremony last week that drew hundreds of new citizens .
At the booth next door , Kathy Checchi , wife of gubernatorial candidate Al Checchi , used her fluent Spanish to win over new voters to the Democratic Party .
`` Latinos , your vote is your voice , '' bellowed a Democratic recruiter in Spanish .
Begg responded in Spanish , `` You can register with us , it doesn n't take much time . ''
Tuesday is California 's first open primary , in which people may vote across party lines regardless of their registration .
But like never before , Latino voters are being courted , bilingually , by political parties eager to recruit this growing segment of the electorate .
Traditionally , registration drives have been used to recruit new voters .
Now , radio spots , glossy mailers and especially television commercials are being more widely used , according to analysts .
`` This is unprecedented , '' said Gregory Rodriguez , a research fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy and an expert on Latino politics .
`` This is the first time Latinos have been courted with such intensity and it 's the first time that Spanish-language ads have been bought at this level . ''
Checchi has taken the lead , spending 15 percent of his $ 20 million television budget solely on Spanish commercials , said Elena Stern , his press secretary .
His opponent Jane Harman followed suit with advertisements that began airing in March .
And though the less-wealthy Lt. Gov. Gray Davis will not be airing TV commercials in Spanish , he did begin airing Spanish-language radio spots last Friday , according to his campaign press secretary .
Checchi began airing his English and Spanish-language commercials the same week , showing the equal importance he placed on both .
`` The ads in Spanish are specifically geared toward the Latino community , they are not simply translations , '' said Stern .
And showing just how serious he is about speaking directly to Latino voters , Checchi opened Get Out the Vote offices in 12 Latino neighborhoods throughout the state .
`` We truly believe Latinos are so key for the future of California and will be even more important as we move into the 21st century , '' said Kathy Checchi , who has appeared in numerous commercials telling voters in Spanish about her husband 's strong Italian immigrant roots .
The numbers back up the dollars .
According to the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project , there were 1.35 million registered Latino voters in the state 10 years ago .
Of those , 705,000 voted in the general elections .
In 1992 , 1.55 million Latinos registered to vote , while 1.05 million voted .
The numbers significantly increased in 1996 when 2.1 million Latinos registered to vote and 1.35 million voted .
Stung by strong anti-Republican sentiments created over Proposition 187 in the Latino community , in the past the Republican Party shied away from recruiting voters at naturalization ceremonies .
`` We never made it a concerted part of our strategy , '' said Mike Madrid , political director for the state Republican Party .
`` But we realized there was nothing to fear . ''
Now , with Republican recruiters speaking Spanish , Tagalog and Korean , the results of the party 's efforts are impressive .
Last month , Republicans registered 2,000 voters at the convention center over two days .
Friday , 1,300 & UR ; & LR ; more were added .
Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren , who launched his Spanish-language commercials last week , also offers Internet browsers a chance to hear his biography with Spanish-language audio .
( SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS )
`` ( Lungren 's ) very serious about asking Latinos to vote for him and that is accomplished in part through advertising in Spanish-language media outlets , '' said campaign director David Puglia .
Rodriguez believes the increasing number of Latino voters makes it cost-effective for candidates to make their case in Spanish .
This year , Latinos are likely to make up 13 percent of the California electorate , up from 7 percent in 1990 , he said .
`` It 's a bigger return for your money and it 's significant enough of the electorate that you 're willing to have separate campaign strategies , '' said Rodriguez .
Rodriguez believes Spanish-language strategies are not necessarily the wave of the future .
He points to a Latino Issues Forum survey done earlier this year by political scientist Fernando Guerra that found only 18 percent of the Latino electorate is likely to get their news from Spanish-language media .
`` I think we 're going to see ethnic targeting marketing in the future , '' said Rodriguez .
`` You 'll see Latinos being courted in English . ''
Madrid , who authored the `` Media and Campaign Strategy for the California Latino Voter , '' said in his report that the greatest number of Latino votes can be garnered by utilizing English speaking media , supplemented by a secondary effort in Spanish media .
Others disagree .
According to exit polls conducted by the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project , 32 percent of Latinos who cast votes in 1996 got their information from Spanish language-resources .
`` In the old days , voters didn n't watch Spanish television , '' said Antonio Gonzalez , president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project , a nonpartisan group in Montebello .
`` Maybe 5 percent of the electorate was watching Spanish TV , but today you have 25 to 30 percent watching , '' he said .
`` I think you have a new pattern emerging since 1996 with the campaigns and parties and candidates really taking note of the big turnout of Latino voters . ''
Often both monolingual and bilingual speakers exist within a Latino family , resulting in a ripple effect for Spanish-language advertising , he said .
`` It is considered to be a way of showing respect and appealing to the Latino electorate and has significance beyond the very important numbers that are now watching , '' said Gonzalez .
In an effort to reach Spanish-speaking voters , the Christian Coalition of California has begun distributing Spanish voter guides in churches throughout California , including the Fuentes de Vida church in Sun Valley .
The voter guides are part of an `` unprecedented '' effort to communicate the message that the Coalition and Latino Catholic voters share many of the same values , the group said .
At the local level , campaign deputies were reluctant to talk about strategy targeting Latinos .
But state Senate candidate Richard Katz , for instance , offers his biography and mailers in Spanish .
His opponent , City Councilman Richard Alarcon has also sent out mailers in Spanish , according to his political consultant , Richie Ross .
That type of campaigning can only benefit local candidates , said Estela Lopez , a communications consultant for Estela Lopez Consulting .
`` It 's not only politically correct , but politically smart to set money aside for campaign outreach in Spanish , '' said Lopez .
`` Whether it 's an issue or candidate , you can n't run in Los Angeles without something in Spanish . ''
