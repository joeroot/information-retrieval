JETS LOSE ANOTHER MEMBER OF ' 96 OFFENSE ATTEMPT

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ The Jets lost another key component of the high-profile influx of offense they made two years ago when they released right tackle David Williams on Monday .
Williams , plagued with recurrent back problems that continually interrupted his Jets career , was about to retire , and will most likely do so .
But the release evoked memories of the Jets ' failed 1996 attempt to buy an offense .
Williams was one of four highly touted free agents the Jets picked up for $ 57 million in long-term contracts in 1996 : he joined quarterback Neil O ' Donnell , left tackle Jumbo Elliott and wide receiver Jeff Graham .
The Jets were widely applauded for these bold moves in their attempt to come back from their 1995 record of 3 - 13 .
But each of the four was injured at some point during the year and the club wound up with a franchise-worst record of 1 - 15 .
The Jets turned themselves around anyway , improving to 9 - 7 last year in Bill Parcells ' first season as the coach , but with less help from Williams .
Now , only Elliott is assured of a starter 's role on the Jets next season .
Graham was traded last draft day , while O ' Donnell remains unwavering in his demand that he receive his full 1998 salary of $ 4.2 million .
The club wants to cut that in half , and so his status remains unclear .
With Williams gone , Jason Fabini , a fourth-round draft pick from Cincinnati , a school that rarely produces offensive linemen for the pros , now becomes a candidate at right tackle .
He is 6 feet 7 inches tall and 310 pounds , and if he can make the lineup , it will give the Jets a pair of bookend tackles of spectacular size .
`` I 've got a bit of a logjam at right tackle , '' Parcells said Monday as the week of rookie camp began .
In addition to Fabini , there is the veteran Siupeli Malamala , who was once the club 's starter at the position , as well as the rookie Eric Bateman of Brigham Young and Deron Thorp of Nevada , who spent last season playing for the Barcelona Dragons of the NFL Europe .
For Fabini , whose time in the 40-yard run is slow but whose movements off the snap are quick , the shift to the right side should not be a problem .
He played left tackle in college .
`` But I 'm right-handed , '' he said .
`` And anyway , I 've been playing football since the fourth grade . ''
Parcells wants a player like Fabini to make it for two obvious reasons : He could have a long run with the team , and he is cheaper to sign .
The Jets are only now getting some freedom from the salary cap that has hung over them since the four-player signing of 1996 .
Parcells has a few million dollars and would like even more for what he calls `` fudge money , '' emergency funds .
The club saves about $ 300,000 toward this year 's cap in releasing Williams .
Fabini doesn n't understand all the economics .
After all , he got his degree in business only last December .
Then he went to work for a money manager .
`` If I didn n't make it in football , '' he said , `` I had my degree . ''
Still , on draft day , when he wasn n't taken in the first three rounds , he was close to throwing something .
Then Parcells called him and told him he was a Jet .
`` It was neat to be drafted , '' he said , `` but now I 've got to do some things . ''

Dorian Boose , the Jets ' top draft pick , was a close friend and Washington State teammate of Eric Bender , the Raiders ' second-round draft pick who was found dead Saturday at a business associate 's home in Marietta , Ga. Boose and Bender were roommates , both played defensive line and both often talked of making it in the NFL .
`` We all knew he had a problem with epilepsy , '' Boose said , `` but he hadn n't had an episode in three-and-a-half years .
The last time I saw him was at graduation , when we congratulated each other and gave each other a hug . ''
The two used to roughhouse in hotel rooms the morning of games , Boose recalled .
`` We 'd tackle each other , but once we heard the bed crack , we 'd stop . ''
Boose said his wife , Brenda , was to speak at a memorial service for Bender .
The Jets will not be looking at David Meggett , Parcells said , despite the fact that Meggett was one of his favorite players .
`` I 'm only interested in him as a person , '' Parcells said .
Meggett was cut last week by the Patriots .
He has not recovered from a broken foot and faces a trial on sexual assault charges .
