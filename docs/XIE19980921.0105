Internet Awareness and Use Grow in Kenya
NAIROBI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The rise in Internet awareness in Kenya has triggered a spiral growth in on-line trading as at least 25,000 people in the country have Internet access .
The vast potential of on-line trading was apparent at a recent Internet auction of seats to various European destinations by Lufthansa Airlines .
Kenyans were among 600 potential buyers who bid through the Internet .
The rise in Internet awareness and use was first noted during the 1997 general election in the east African country and is largely credited to the Nation Media Group website , which had an average of 50,000 hits a day .
During the December election month , Internet services reported eight million visits to Kenyan sites , Barney Lodge , chief of Media Street , an electronic advertising agency in Nairobi , was quoted by Monday 's East African as saying .
In Kenya , " at least 25,000 people have Internet access and the number is bound to grow as the cost of connections and computers falls and back-up services improve , " said Lodge .
Until two years ago , computers cost not less than 100,000 Shillings ( 1,666 U.S. Dollars ) but prices now average 60,000 Shillings ( 1,000 Dollars ) , largely due to a reduct o , HZ7 import duty and competition among a large number of importers .
The growth in the number of Internet users has , however , been hampered by poor telephone connections , with most business clients reluctant to invest in developing their own websites , fearing that these would not be easily accessible .
In response , the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation is planning to install a fiber optic telephone network by November , which will provide " clean " and fast Internet connections .
However , Victor Mabachi , chairman of the Advertising Practitioners Associations ( APA ) , said the Internet still lacks a solid client base to attract good advertising .
Currently , the bulk of advertising on the Internet is by small-scale traders , who constitute 75 percent of all advertisers , said Geoffrey Shimanyula , the marketing manager of AfricaOnline , which is Kenya 's biggest Internet service provider .
