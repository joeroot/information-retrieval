Chengdu Plain Identified As Cradle of Civilization
CHENGDU , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Chengdu Plain in southwest China 's Sichuan Province was one of the places of origin of ancient civilization on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River , according to Chinese archaeologists .
They came to the conclusion after excavating the site of the 4,000-year-old city of Sandaoyan in Pixian County .
Ancient Sichuan was considered as having been a wild and uncivilized place until 1986 , when archaeologists excavated the site of ancient city Sanxingdui , which dates back 2,300 years , near Guang ' an City .
The site of the ancient city of Sandaoyan , 650 m long and 500 m wide , is so far the largest excavation of a pre-historic civilization on the Chengdu Plain .
The excavated items include flat-bottomed jars , pottery vessels , stone axes and chisels .
The archaeologists also discovered the foundations of a large building in the center of the city , which was probably a palace or temple of some sort .
The 550-sq-m building is also regarded as the largest public building dating back to pre-historic times .
