India to Lodge Protest Against U.S. At WTO
NEW DELHI , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- An Indian minister vowed Sunday to lodge a protest at the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) against the United States for its decision to blacklist 40 Indian entities from having any business and trade link with American companies .
" We will lodge a strong protest against the U.S. action since it is particularly not consistent with the WTO policies and regulations , " Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde said on the sidelines of the inaugural session of the Group-77 Trade Conference which opened here Sunday .
The Clinton Administration decided Friday to bar 40 Indian entities and their over 200 subsidiaries from having any business and trade ties with companies of the U.S.
Asked whether the latest U.S. action would hurt India 's exports , the Indian minister said India would find other markets than the U.S. to export its goods .
The Hindustan Times reported Sunday that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has written to United States President Bill Clinton , expressing his unhappiness over a shift in Washington 's stand in its dialogue with New Delhi .
On remarks by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott at the Brookings Institute earlier this week which revealed the contents of the negotiations between the two countries , Vajpayee complained that Washington breached an understanding reached earlier on the mode of the talks .
A spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs Saturday termed the ban by the U.S. as " coercive and counter-productive " .
