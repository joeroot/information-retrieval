Chinese Brewers Eyeing U.S. Market
BEIJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese beer is expected to begin competing more in the United States , the largest beer market in the world , according to Asian Strategic Investments Corp. ( ASIMCO ) .
The company announced today that its joint venture in Beijing , the Five Star Beer Co. Ltd. , will begin shipping to the U.S. tomorrow .
Five Star will be the second Chinese beer with large-scale sales overseas , after Qingdao Beer , which began shipments abroad two decades ago .
It now has annual exports to the U.S. of 800,000 standard cases .
According to Jack Perkowski , chairman and CEO of ASIMCO , the first four containers , or 5,000 cases of Five Star Beer , will leave Tianjin port in north China on Tuesday .
Each case contains four six-packs .
Starting in October , 40 containers will be shipped to the U.S. monthly , he said .
Five Star has been exported to China 's neighbors , says Chang Huaizhi , technical director of the joint venture , who explains that they can now export to the U.S. on a large scale because Five Star 's quality is consistent and it has access to a national network of 600 distributors .
Chinese analysts say Five Star has a light , smooth , and non-bitter taste that may be easily accepted by U.S. beer drinkers .
The packaging points to its Chinese character and attempts to attract American consumers , who are known for their willingness to try beer from different parts of the world .
Annual beer consumption in the U.S. is 20 million tons , and in spite of a flat market last year , imports grew 14.1 percent .
Five Star hopes to become one of the top 25 imported brands in the U.S. in the future , Perkowski said .
It will be positioned as a premium beer in the U.S. , the same as Qingdao , he says , and it will be available not only in Chinese restaurants and Chinatowns , but in grocery stores and supermarkets in the fifty states .
