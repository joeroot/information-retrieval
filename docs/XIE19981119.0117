U.S. Convinced of DPRK 's Nuclear-Related Activities
SEOUL , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. special envoy for Korean affairs Charles Kartman Thursday said the United States was convinced that the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) is constructing an underground nuclear facility .
" There is compelling evidence that this site is intended to be used for nuclear-related activities , " Kartman told reporters after flying in from Pyongyang .
It is the first time that a high-ranking U.S. official has confirmed the underground facility being constructed was to be used for manufacturing nuclear weapons .
While in Pyongyang , the U.S. special envoy asked for U.S. access to the suspected underground nuclear project now underway in Kumchangni , some 40 kilometers northwest of Youngbyon of the DPRK .
" We asked the North Korean side to remove our suspicions about Kumchangni , " Kartman said .
The Kumchangni site is the only one the United States is now pressing the DPRK to allow on-the-spot nuclear inspections , said Kartman , who met South Korean officials earlier Thursday .
A U.S. inter-agency team led by the special envoy conducted " quite intensive discussions " in Pyongyang with a DPRK team headed by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye-kwan without making any significant breakthrough .
" Although we discussed some ideas for access to that site , there is still a rather wide gap between our positions , " the envoy said .
During the discussions , the DPRK officials , who denied they were engaged in nuclear-related activities , demanded monetary compensation in exchange for the " insulting " access to the site .
" We have absolutely rejected the concept of compensation , " Kartman said .
Asked how much the DPRK asked for compensation , he said " the question of the amount is sort of irrelevant " .
While in Pyongyang , Kartman said he delivered a strong message to make sure that the DPRK understood how serious the nuclear issue was .
He hinted that failure to gain access to inspect the site could directly affect the 1994 U.S-DPRK Agreed Framework , under which Pyongyang pledged to freeze its nuclear programs in return for receiving two light-water nuclear reactors and heavy fuel oil .
" My presentations contained very clear elements that failure in resolving the suspicions would pose a threat to the viability of the Agreed Framework , " he said .
Washington and Pyongyang will continue talks on the alleged underground nuclear facility .
" We have invited the North Koreans to continue these serious talks as soon as possible , " he said , adding that the future schedule would be discussed by their representatives in New York .
The U.S. envoy said that Washington and Seoul would maintain close cooperation in dealing with the DPRK nuclear issue .
