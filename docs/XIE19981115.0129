As a least developed country , Bangladesh is on the verge of marginalization in the free trade environment under the globalization process , said vice-president Zafar Osman of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( DCCI ) .
" Our imports have been increasing by leaps and bounds but exports have remained concentrated on a few items and in two markets -- the United States and the European Union -- only , " Osman pointed out .
It is necessary to diversify the country 's exports and markets , he emphasized , saying " participation in the international trade fairs is one of the effective ways to popularize export products . "
