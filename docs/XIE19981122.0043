Jiang Zemin Arrives in Moscow for Sixth Summit
MOSCOW , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived here Sunday afternoon local time for a four-day visit at the invitation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin .
During his stay , Jiang will have his first informal meeting with Yeltsin , dedicated to extensive and in-depth discussions on bilateral ties and international issues of common concern .
The " no-tie " meeting is expected to promote the healthy growth of a strategic partnership between the two countries .
As results , a joint statement on the bilateral relations in the 21st century and other important documents are expected .
This is the sixth summit meeting between the two heads of state .
Jiang visited Russia in 1994 and 1997 , and Yeltsin visited China in 1992 , 1996 and 1997 .
This time , Jiang will also meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov , Chairman Yegor Stroyev of the Federation Council , the Upper House of parliament , and Chairman Gennady Seleznev of the State Duma , the Lower House of parliament .
He is scheduled to tour New Siberia after his stay in Moscow .
Since the first summit in December 1992 , China and Russia have signed a series of important documents , and their relationship has embarked on a track of mutually beneficial cooperation .
In the first summit in Beijing , they worked out a total of 24 documents , including a joint statement on the foundation of the bilateral relations , a protocol on disarmament , an agreement on confidence building in the military field in border areas , and accords on economic , trade , science and cultural cooperation .
When Jiang visited Russia in December 1994 , the two presidents signed a joint declaration , stating that the two countries shall de-target their strategic nuclear weapons at each other .
In addition , they signed a joint statement committing their countries to reducing military presence along their common borders to the lowest possible level , commensurate with their neighborly ties .
The two sides also penned an agreement on the western section of the Sino-Russian border .
Two years later , when Yeltsin visited China again , he and Jiang agreed to build a strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st century between the two countries .
The two presidents agreed to establish a mechanism of regular meetings between leaders of the two countries .
They stated in Beijing that the demarcation on the eastern section of the Sino-Russian border had been completed .
In April 1997 , Jiang and Yeltsin signed a joint statement in Moscow to endorse the multi-polarization of the world and the building of a new world order .
Observers here said the frequent exchange of visits between Chinese and Russian leaders , together with the wide range of common understanding they have reached , have secured the stable growth of the neighborly relationship between the two countries .
