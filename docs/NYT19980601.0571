MAYOR AND COUNCIL DEADLOCK OVER BUDGET

NEW YORK _ Negotiations over New York City 's next budget broke down Monday as the City Council prepared for the first time to pass its own spending plan , perhaps as early as Friday , without the agreement of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani .
Council leaders said a breakthrough appeared unlikely because of Giuliani 's refusal to consider any changes that council members have sought in his budget proposal unless Peter Vallone , the speaker of the council , abandoned his referendum proposal on Yankee Stadium .
The mayor said that if the council passed its own budget , he would use his broad powers to make deep cuts in programs dear to council members .
After a fruitless 15-minute meeting between the two top negotiators for the mayor and the council early Monday , Giuliani and Vallone held dueling news conferences and , amid much chest-thumping , said they would not budge from their positions .
`` Yankee Stadium has absolutely nothing to do with the adoption of this budget , no matter how hard the mayor tries to make it , '' said Vallone , D-Queens .
`` Nonexistent , '' Giuliani , a Republican , said when he was asked about budget negotiations .
Clearly relishing the possibility of a fight with the council , the mayor added : `` I 've read the City Charter three times now .
So we 're ready for them . ''
As of last night , no budget meetings between the mayor and the speaker 's aides were scheduled for this week , officials involved in the negotiations said , but if history is any guide , both sides could resolve matters at the last minute .
Under the City Charter , the council must adopt a budget by June 5 for the fiscal year beginning next month .
Although City Hall officials have routinely exceeded that deadline , they said they had never encountered such a severe impasse before .
While the mayor and the speaker were able to reach agreement on budgets that included painful cuts in city services during Giuliani 's first term , the current apparent deadlock seems paradoxical , given the fact that the city is ending the 1998 fiscal year with a record $ 2 billion surplus .
The battle started in April , when a 500-pound chunk of Yankee Stadium fell into the seats , prompting renewed discussion about building a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan .
Giuliani suggested using revenue from a commercial tax to help pay for a new stadium .
But Vallone , saying the public should have a say on whether tax money should be used for a new stadium , called for a referendum on the November ballot .
Dropping the referendum proposal now would be politically difficult for Vallone , who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor .
Most council members , especially those in the Bronx and Manhattan , oppose the idea of moving the Yankees south .
Vallone and other leaders want to change Giuliani 's budget plan to include a $ 1.4 billion cut in the personal income tax over three years and $ 226 million more in spending on schools , libraries and cultural programs .
Council leaders said they were ready to draft and pass their own budget on Friday .
Such an action would be a hostile move that the mayor could veto .
The council could then override the mayor 's veto , after which the wrangling would probably end up in court .
The council has not passed its own budget since the 1989 City Charter revision enabled it to do so .
`` It 's unfortunate when schools are falling down , '' said Bruce Bender , Vallone 's chief of staff , `` when there 's over 30,000 day care slots that need to be filled , when libraries are at risk , when there 's overcrowding in the schools , that we are bogged down in an issue that 's not related to the budget . ''

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
Randy Mastro , deputy mayor for operations , said that while council leaders were publicly saying that Yankee Stadium had nothing to do with current budget talks , they had in fact privately examined the issue .
To buttress his point , the mayor 's aides gave reporters a page from the council 's alternative budget plan , which includes an item stating that a new Sports Facilities Corporation can study the idea of a ball park , as long as it is not `` located south of 125th Street in Manhattan . ''
`` Peter Vallone is saying the stadium issue has nothing to do with the budget , '' Mastro said , `` but his internal documents prove quite the opposite . ''
Thomas McMahon , the council 's finance director , said the Council drew that provision because of the Giuliani administration 's unwillingness to negotiate unless the stadium issue was resolved .
The provision , he said , was in keeping with Vallone 's opposition to a ball park on the West Side .
At the news conference , however , Giuliani barely mentioned the nettlesome stadium issue .
Casting himself as a fiscal conservative trying to rein in a free-spending council , the mayor focused his attacks on the council 's proposal to spend an additional $ 226 million .
