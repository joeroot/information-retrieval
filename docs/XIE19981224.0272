Uganda Refutes Reports on Electro-Magnetic
KAMPALA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The management of Uganda Electricity Board ( UEB ) has refuted media reports that exposure to low-frequency electro-magnetic fields can cause cancer , leukemia and brain tumor in people , including unborn babies .
They dismissed the reports in a press release issued Wednesday as unfounded .
Alex Mugoya , UEB 's acting managing director , said information available to the Board shows that there is so far inadequate evidence to prove these claims .
Research by the Institute of Electrical Engineers had concluded that there is no firm evidence of low-frequency electro-magnetic fields having any biological effects , and neither is there any mechanism which could produce such effects , he added .
Mugoya advised that all matters concerning environmental and health hazards related to high-voltage electricity transmission lines should be referred to relevant professional and specialized bodies .
Previously , some newspaper reports said that exposure to the above-mentioned environment would lead to serious health problems , making the public worry about their living environment and incurring strong demands for movement to other areas .
