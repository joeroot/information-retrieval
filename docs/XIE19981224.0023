Draft Securities Law Sparks Heated Debates ( 1 )
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Heated debates have taken place between members of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress over the draft securities law aimed at keeping control over the flotation and listing of companies .
Many law-makers described the revised draft which insists on a check and approval system rather than a mere go-ahead as making great progress in preventing abuses of the system .
It means that the China Securities Regulatory Commission will be responsible for checking company documents and once these are proved accurate and reliable , it can give permission for the company to go public .
" The measure will help prevent the CSRC from abusing its power while increasing transparency in stock issuing , " said Jiang Shushen , a Standing Committee member .
" The old practice of the CSRC having the overall right to approval has given tangible benefits to certain people at the cost of the investors ' interests , " he added .
The law-makers differed , however , on what a role the government should play in the market place and to what extent it should interfere .
Jiang Zhenghua , vice-chairman of the Standing Committee , said , " The government should leave many issues relating to securities companies ' internal management to be regulated and settled by market forces in the long run .
Therefore the present law need not be so specific about these issues . "
Yet another member , Huang Yuzhang , argued that as the stock market is highly risky , relaxed government administration would probably lead to chaos , or social unrest .
Standing Committee 's vice-chairman Cheng Siwei and two other members questioned a provision in the revised draft law which suggests that issuing stock premiums should be approved by the CSRC .
" Does the measure comply to the law of the market place ?
What responsibility will the CSRC have if the approved premium is found unreasonable ? "
they asked .
