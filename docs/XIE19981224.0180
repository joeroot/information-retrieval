Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to " Dissidents " in China ( 7 )
Some so-called " democratic activists " in China fled overseas and launched worldwide campaigns against the Chinese government , with speeches and articles claiming that China would be in chaos in three months .
The failure of their original predictions was followed by yet another claim that chaos would rock the country within 10 years .
They colluded with splittists in Taiwan and Tibet , inherited the anti-Communist and anti-China sentiment of some members in the international community , and attempted to create obstacles in order to sabotage the republic 's efforts to perfect democracy .
They responded to rebukes by patriotic overseas Chinese and defended themselves as patriots .
They claimed that not loving the People 's Republic of China led by the Communist Party in no way diminished their love for the nation .
However , the motherland they claim to love is simply an abstract China , or the " one China " claimed by the Taiwan authorities .
Facts clearly demonstrate that freedom and democracy in China are unlikely to result from any action on the part of the United States .
Relations between countries have historically centered on resorting to sheer strength to suppress the weak and using other nations in pursuit of personal interests .
It is no each job for countries to seek mutual benefits , not to speak unselfish assistance with one another .
China 's democratic system relies on the efforts of citizens to gradually complete through political and economic reforms in peaceful environment .
Chinese citizens will enjoy more freedom and democracy along with continued economic growth in a stable environment .
