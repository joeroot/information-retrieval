Demands Immediate Iraqi Compliance on Inspections
LONDON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Saturday urged Iraq to make " immediate and unconditional " compliance to the demands made by the United Nations if it really wants to resume cooperation with weapon inspectors .
" Nothing less than unconditional compliance will do , " Blair said outside his Downing Street office .
Blair made the remark after Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. promising to comply with its demand to allow a resumption of its weapons inspections .
" Any conditions of this nature are unacceptable .
There can be no negotiations , no further deals , " Blair said .
Meanwhile , he noted that British troops on standby in Kuwait would remain on alert to the possibility of military action at any time .
British high-ranking officials said earlier that Blair and U.S. president Bill Clinton had spoken by telephone on four occasions in the last 24 hours to discuss the Iraqi crisis .
