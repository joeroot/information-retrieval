Ferretti to Open in SoHo
NEW YORK _ Ever since acquiring a building at 30 West 56th St. for her U.S. headquarters a few years ago , Alberta Ferretti has been extending the reach of her company outside Italy .
She formed Aeffe USA , which produces and distributes the collections of Moschino , Rifat Ozbek , Jean Paul Gaultier and Narciso Rodriguez , in addition to her own lines .
She recently opened in-store boutiques for her signature and Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti lines at Bergdorf Goodman .
And she has now secured a location for her first freestanding store in the United States , in SoHo .
That store , at 452 West Broadway , near Prince Street , is for the Philosophy collection , a lower-priced version of the signature line aimed at a younger woman .
She is still searching for an uptown spot to open an Alberta Ferretti store .
The West Broadway building , next door to a Rizzoli bookstore , is a Federal-style town house built in the late 1800s .
When renovation is completed in late summer , it will have a three-story glass front and skylights , allowing the interior to be bathed in natural light .
There will be a two-story main floor and a mezzanine , with a zigzag staircase and a sloped frosted glass floor .
The floor , bordered in concrete , will have water flowing beneath it and will be illuminated from below .
The architect is David Ling .
The stark interior , softened by a curving cashier 's counter of ebonized maple and an ornamental niche on the second floor , should be an appropriate background for the softly feminine clothes with their delicate details and colors .
Most designers and fashion companies open flagship stores for their signature lines first to establish a presence , and then follow with boutiques for their secondary lines .
Ms. Ferretti is doing the reverse , because a space became available that was the right size for Philosophy and because she felt that SoHo was the best place to attract the with-it customers to whom the line appeals .
The area is enjoying a rebirth , with an influx of designer boutiques , making SoHo a fashionable shopping destination again after years during which it threatened to become more like a mall with mass merchants taking over .
Beguelin , by Another Name
Henry Beguelin and his business partner , Tullio Murani , have parted ways .
Beguelin has formed a new leather-goods company in Milan , Italy , called Henry Cuir , using the French word for leather .
Murani retains the rights to the name Henry Beguelin and plans to continue producing handbags and other leather goods in Italy in the trademark Beguelin style , utilizing African trade beads and embroideries .
Beguelin himself has a new design philosophy .
He has in a sense returned to his roots , eschewing the African-inspired decorative elements he had added to differentiate his leather bags and belts from those of others .
He is now concentrating on pure design , working with a single leather skin , folding it to achieve a finished shape rather than using several pieces of leather sewn together .
In the spirit of his new esthetic , which is more Asian than African , he is using no hardware and lining his bags in red , a symbol of luck in ancient Chinese culture .
He is also working for the first time with exotic skins like alligator and skate fish .
Barneys New York will introduce the Henry Cuir collection in the fall , said Judith Collinson , the store 's general merchandise manager for women 's ready-to-wear and accessories .
Ms. Collinson , who has known Beguelin for many years , said he had become restless and bored with the sameness of what his company had been producing and wanted to begin again .
She said he felt that there was no longer anything unexpected in the look of the products , which came to include dog collars , luggage , leather objects and furnishings .
The Henry Cuir leather handbags for fall will be priced from $ 575 to $ 875 ; the exotic skins will range from $ 1,700 to about $ 5 , 000 .
