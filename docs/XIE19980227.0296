LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook , whose country is the current European Union president , will pay a visit to the Middle East in mid-March to push forward the stalled Middle East peace process .
A British Foreign Office spokesman said Thursday that Cook would travel to the region in his capacity as a representative of the EU 's presidency and would visit Israel , the Palestinian self-rule territories .
The spokesman said that Cook 's visit would pave the way for a tour of the region by British Prime Minister Tony Blair some time in late March or early April .
" The objective is to ensure that the EU plays its part in pushing the parties to relaunch the peace process , " said the spokesman .
He added that " We remain extremely disturbed that the peace process has stalled ... and we want to work with the United States to make a decisive push in the months ahead on the process . "
