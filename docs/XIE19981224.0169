Bangkok Faces Water Crisis Next Year
BANGKOK , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- A tapwater crisis is looming large for half a million residents in Bangkok , a city sheltering about six million people .
An official from the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority ( MWA ) said Thursday that raw water supplies from the Bhumibol and Sirikit dams , the main sources , would drop from four million cubic meters to 3.6 million from January to July next year .
The MWA expects some 140,000 families or about 500,000 people in Bangkok and neighboring Samut Prakan to be affected , with the hardest-hit likely to be those residing near where water mains end .
The MWA called on families living closer to the beginning of a water main to economize so there would be enough left for those down the line .
A substantial decrease in rainfalls in the North and the Northeast , particularly in water catchment areas , have caused reservoir water at several dams to subside considerably .
The government has warned of a water crisis since last month after finding a drop of up to 60 percent in the volume of reservoir water at the country 's major dams .
A save-water campaign will be launched in Bangkok during January 10 - 16 , the official said .
