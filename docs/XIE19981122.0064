Denmark Beats China 2 - 1 in Badminton Friendly
BEIJING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The visiting Denmark shuttlers showed their superiority in men 's singles with a 2 - 1 victory over China at a badminton friendly here on Sunday .
China sent their Thomas Cup men 's singles trio , Sun Jun , Dong Jiong and Luo Yigang while Denmark dispatched Peter Gade , Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen and Kenneth Jonassen .
Cheered on by a sellout crowd at the Beijing College Stadium , Dong Jiong , the 25-year-old home favorite , tied the current world number one Peter Gade 9 - 15 , 15 - 6 in the first two games of the opening match .
Dong , runner-up of the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996 , led the third game 8 - 5 and 13 - 11 before Peter scored four consecutive points to triumph 15 - 13 , winning the 70-minute battle for Denmark .
" I had no pressure compared with Dong even though I was not familiar with the court , " said the 21-year-old Peter .
" I fortunately exploited Dong 's unforced errors in the third game and won the match . "
The 75-minute tussle between Luo Yigang and Kenneth Jonassen was just a copy of first rubber .
The world number 13 Jonassen and Luo , fourth on the world rankings , split the first two games 17 - 15 , 15 - 6 respectively .
Luo got off to a good start 8 - 3 in third game but his defensive returns let his rival many chances to smash , conceding the lead to Jonassen .
The Dane then led 14 - 11 before the 24-year-old Luo saved six match points to lose the decider 12 - 15 .
The confrontation between Olympic gold medalist Hoyer-Larsen and 1998 All-England champion Sun Jun was one-sided when Sun led all the way to a 15 - 9 , 15 - 5 victory .
" It was a close match though we won the best-of-three match .
Both players performed very well , " said Thomas Lund , coach of the Denmark team .
" We were lucky to snatch the victory at both deciders of first two matches when Chinese shuttlers still had chances to win . "
Li Yongbo , the Chinese head coach , said : " The loss showed our weakness at net play and at the ability of converting the crucial points . "
At the Thomas Cup in Hong Kong last May , China lost a derby 3 - 2 in the preliminary round when world championship runner-up Sun fell to world top player Peter Gade and Olympic silver medalist Dong was defeated by Jonassen .
Luo chalked up the only singles victory for China against Hoyer-Larsen in three rubbers .
Both teams lost their semi-finals as China were beaten by Indonesia while Denmark defeated by Malaysia .
