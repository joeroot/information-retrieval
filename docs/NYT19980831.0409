NEW YORK : bond funds .
Bearing the brunt of Monday 's selloff were many of the technology stocks that have been the most popular with individual investors and the mutual funds in which they invest .
The Nasdaq composite index , the major market index most heavily populated with technology issues , fell 140 points , or 8.6 percent , to 1499.25 _ its second worst daily decline in points and the fourth-worst in percentage terms .
The Nasdaq index is now 4.5 percent below the level it started the year .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange measured 914.7 million shares , the third busiest day ever on the Big Board , and the number of stocks that declined exceeded those that advanced by a ratio of more than seven to one .
Exceptionally heavy volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange caused a computer problem near the end of trading .
But despite that glitch , Rubin said that the financial market 's mechanisms worked `` effectively . ''
The Dow industrial average has declined nearly 1,799 points , or 19.2 percent , from its highest-ever closing price of 9337.97 on July 17 .
That is slightly less , in percentage terms , than the 21.2 percent loss in the index 's value in the bear market of 1990 , which lasted from mid-June through early October .
Most other stock markets around the world posted losses Monday , partly in response to last week 's decline in the American stock market .
Germany 's leading market index fell 2.3 percent Monday , while stock prices in Great Britain fell 2.2 percent .
In Hong Kong , the stock market plummeted , falling more than 7 percent after the government , which intervened to help prop up share prices last week , failed to do so again .
Virtually alone among the world 's major equity markets , Japanese share prices rose 1.4 percent on Monday , bouncing off its lowest level in more than a decade last week .
To some traders and stock-market analysts , the decline on Wall Street Monday took on some of the characteristics of a selling frenzy , the type of relentless liquidation of investors ' portfolios that comes only at the point of maximum pessimism .
`` The only good thing I see is that they are finally going after the sacred cows , the drugs and the retail stocks and the technology sector , '' said Henry Herrmann , chief investment officer at Waddell & AMP ; Reed , an Overland Park , Kan. , mutual fund company .
Until Monday , those stocks had proved a sort of refuge from the storm .
`` When they are pounding the stocks that wouldn n't go down , that tells me that the sentiment is really negative , '' Herrmann said .
`` And when the sentiment gets that negative , you can get a reversal pretty quick . ''
While Herrmann suggested a stock bounce might be in order , Monday 's rout , and the round of relentless selling at the end of trading , leaves open the possibility that further declines will follow Tuesday .
Relatively few market participants seem to believe that the downturn in stock prices is finished .
`` It may be that we are reaching a temporary climax , '' said Richard McCabe , an analyst at Merrill Lynch who tracks the market 's technical indicators .
But he said that the market was just as likely to stumble further , at least as low as 7 , 400 , which was the market 's lowest point in January and 2 percent below its current level .
Last October , on the day that Dow industrials fell 554 points , the Dow index fell as low as 6971 .
McCabe noted that both Monday and Friday , the market started the day with a sharp upward move _ a sign that some investors were hunting for bargains among fallen stocks _ before plunging .
That usually is a sign of further market declines , he said .
A sign that the maximum level of pessimism had been reached , he said , would be for the market to fall sharply in the opening hour after a day when it finishes at its lowest point of the day .
The market will get an opportunity to do just that Tuesday .
Market analysts and participants cited several sources for the heavy selling that came at the end of Monday 's trading .
Laszlo Birinyi , a market analyst who tracks program trading , the computer-driven trading strategies often employed by professional trading firms , said that much of the late-day volume appeared to come from institutions that had placed sell orders earlier in the day and needed them completed before trading ended .
Birinyi concluded that the heavy selling came from mutual fund companies responding to orders placed over the weekend and during the trading day .
Thre was some concern among traders that heavy selling was coming from index mutual funds , one of the few categories of stock funds that have continued to take in cash during the market 's recent decline .
But George U. Sauter , a managing director at the Vanguard Group who oversees the company 's index funds , said in an interview that Vanguard 's two big funds that track the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500-stock index did not participate in the market Monday .
`` By and large we 've had positive cash flow into the funds , although certainly not to the extent we had earlier in the year , '' Sauter said .
One of the big Vanguard index funds had a slight outflow but that was balanced out by an inflow into the other , Sauter said , meaning the impact on the S&AMP ; P 500 was canceled out .
Near the end of the day , according to two traders , heavy selling of stock-index futures by hedge funds prompted some institutions to activate what are known as index arbitrage trades .
In these cases , the trades involved selling the stocks in the S&AMP ; P 500 index and buying the associated futures , in an attempt to lock in as profit the difference between the futures contract and the higher-priced stocks .
Also lending a negative tone to the day 's events was an announcement late in the day by Salomon Smith Barney , which manages one of Wall Street 's biggest trading operations , that it had suffered trading losses of approximately $ 360 million after taxes over the last two months .
The total included $ 60 million from Russia-related credits , $ 120 million in the company 's bond arbitrage portfolio and $ 180 million in other arbitrage businesses .
In such an environment , few stocks were able to maintain gains ; only 27 of the stocks in the S&AMP ; P 500 rose Monday .
Among the winners were utility companies , a traditional haven in tough times because of their high dividends , and shares of companies that sell food , beverages and other staples that consumers are expected to buy in good times and bad .
Monday 's stock plunge knocked about $ 700 billion off the market value of companies in the Wilshire 5000 index .
Since mid-July , the market capitalization of the index , which is made up of about 7,600 U.S. companies and is often used as a proxy for the entire stock market , has shrunk by nearly $ 2.5 trillion .
The rout has taken big swipes out of some long-time investor favorites .
Coca-Cola , for example , lost $ 18.8 billion of market value Monday , and since mid-July , the company has lost nearly $ 59 billion of its value , or 26 percent .
