UNSCOM Affirms Anew Disciplines in Iraq
BAGHDAD , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) on disarming Iraq has reaffirmed its disciplines to the weapons inspectors who have returned to Baghdad , sources close to UNSCOM told Xinhua Wednesday .
Wednesday is the first day for the U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their work in Iraq .
The sources said the inspectors were asked to strictly obey the relevant regulations to avoid " unnecessary troubles . "
Diplomatic sources here said the inspection work within the next few days is " crucial and sensitive , " as Baghdad 's sincerity will be tested following its announcement to resume full cooperation with the weapons inspectors .
" Any carelessness from both sides would likely trigger a new crisis , " a diplomat said .
UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said on Tuesday that he will write to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to ask Baghdad to hand out its chemical and biological documents .
Baghdad on Saturday promised unconditional resumption of U.N. weapons inspections and thus narrowly escaped a military strike threatened by the U.S. and Britain to force Iraqi compliance .
But U.S. officials have hinted that if Iraq fails to comply fully with U.N. resolutions in the future , the U.S. will launch punishing attacks without prior warning .
A group of 86 U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Iraq on Tuesday
