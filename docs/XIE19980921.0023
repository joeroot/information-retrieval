Ex-Warlord Charged With Treason in Liberia
LAGOS , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Liberian government has said it has charged 22 persons with treason , including former warlor Roosevelt Johnson , after heavy fighting left scores dead in capital Monrovia .
A report reaching here quoted President Charles Taylor as saying Saturday that some of the fugitives sought by the government had been granted asylum at the U.S. Embassy , and called on the embassy to turn them over .
Residents said Johnson , Taylor 's major rival during Liberia 's seven-year civil war , was among those at the U.S. Embassy , but the embassy did not comment , the report said .
Information Minister Joe Mulbah said in a radio broadcast that the 22 include another former warlord , Alhaji Kromah , Bal Gbala , an adviser to Taylor , and Vamba Kanneh , a one-time member of the government .
" Intelligence reports have confirmed the recruitment and training of dissident groups for the sole purpose of subverting the government under the supervision of Johnson and his collaborators , " he said .
Mulbah said the Justice Ministry was asking the accused to turn themselves in to any police station .
" Any group of persons harboring the accused must turn them over immediately to the nearest police station with notice to the Ministry of Justice . "
" Failure to do so , such persons or group of persons will be construed as collaborators and will be dealt with as such , " the minister said .
Heavy fighting broke out in central Monrovia Friday night and continued until early Saturday , as government security forces moved into the Camp Johnson Road to dislodge Johnson 's supporters .
Taylor and Johnson have been trading accusations recently .
While Taylor accused Johnson of plotting to topple him , Johnson had claimed assassination threats from Taylor .
Freed American slaves founded Liberia as modern Africa 's first republic in 1847 .
Their descendants ruled the country until Master Sergeant Sammel Doe , a Krahn , seized power in a 1980 coup .
He was killed early in the civil war .
