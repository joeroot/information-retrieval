& HT ; Francly , euro may be off the mark & HT ; By Marilyn Geewax & HT ; c.

ATLANTA _ Throughout Western Europe , roughly a million vending machines dispense Coca-Colas .
That 's a pretty tame business ; people drop in their coins and Cokes come out .
What could go wrong ?
Maybe everything .
And soon .
That 's because the machines are set up to accept coins minted by the many different countries of Europe .
But starting Jan.1 , Germany , France , Spain , Italy and seven other European nations will launch a massive effort to withdraw all existing coins and bills and replace them with a single new currency , called the euro .
When the conversion is completed in 2002 , there will be no more Italian lira , or German marks or French francs .
Only the euro will be used to conduct business in all 11 countries .
That means workers who service Coke machines must convert the coin mechanisms to recognize the new currency .
How much will that conversion cost ?
How long will it take ?
How frustrated will consumers get during the transition ?
No one is quite sure what impact the euro conversion will have on profits in the short term .
A couple of years ago , U.S. business leaders cheered the plans to create the euro because they wanted to end the accounting hassles associated with earning money in many different currencies .
But now with the deadline growing closer , the details of conversion are creating real headaches .
As businesses gear up for the change , they are realizing that the euro may be the equivalent of the year 2000 computer bug .
That glitch , known as `` Y2K , '' already is causing huge problems as corporations race to reprogram their computers to correctly interpret dates after Jan. 1 , 2000 .
In Europe , computer programmers are facing Y2K squared .
Not only will they have to prepare for Dec. 31 , 1999 , but they will have to make computers comprehend the symbol for the euro , which I would show you if only my computer were programmed to make the symbol .
Still , even with all of these technical difficulties , many economists believe the introduction of the euro eventually will have a very positive impact on the global economy .
By making it simpler for international companies to sell goods and services in Europe , the euro could ignite trade .
Instead of debating whether it 's worth the trouble to do business in Luxembourg , U.S. corporations will be more inclined to see Europe as one huge market united by a single currency .
Taken together , the 11 countries adopting the euro have about 288 million people who generate nearly 20 percent of the world 's wealth .
The hope is that with a unified currency , the new European Central Bank will be able to create a low-inflation , high-growth environment that knocks down trade barriers .
Anything that boosts tourism , trade and productivity in Europe will be good for U.S. companies such as Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola , which have extensive operations on the continent .
The euro does hold great promise .
But making the transition at the very time computer programmers are struggling with the Y2K bug may be very bad timing .
If technical difficulties trip up the conversion process , distrust and bickering could break out among Europeans , who have a nasty habit of going to war with each other every few decades .
Though most Americans have given the euro little or no thought , its introduction into the global economy could have an enormous impact on U.S. businesses .
It could spur a golden era of trans-Atlantic trade , or trigger an economic crisis that will make Asia 's current troubles seem mild .
