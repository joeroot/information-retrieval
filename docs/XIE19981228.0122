Ugandan , Libyan Heads Discuss Congo ( K ) Crisis
KAMPALA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is now on a visit to Libya to discuss the Congo ( K ) crisis with his Libyan counterpart Muammar Gaddafi , Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua Monday morning .
In a telephone interview , Kivengere said there are some other issues to be discussed , but the four-month-old crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) is on top of the agenda .
The full details of their talks are not available yet , he added .
A report carried in Monday 's New Vision daily said the Museveni-Gaddafi meeting follows hot on the heels of a Christmas visit to Libya by DRC President Laurent Kabila .
Uganda , which has a large military presence in the DRC , has been accused by Kabila of backing the rebellion in the vast central African country , a charge Uganda has denied .
Both Museveni and Kabila eye Libya for support for their respective stance on the DRC crisis .
In October this year , Museveni flew to Libya and held talks with Gaddafi despite the U.N. air embargo imposed on the country .
He returned to Libya later in the same month to attend a meeting which also drew the heads of Eritrea , Chad and Niger .
Museveni left for Tripoli Saturday , accompanied by State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi and other senior officials .
