THE LAST OF THE GIRLS ' SCHOOL GRANDES DAMES

NEW YORK _ Edes Gilbert will soon be the last of the grandes dames to step down as head of a selective New York City private girls ' school , and thus ends an era of powerful women who cloaked their ambitions in plummy diction and good manners .
Mrs. Gilbert recalls that when she first arrived on the Upper East Side to pull the Spence School out of a slump , she was greeted by her friend Evelyn Halpert of Brearley , the girls ' school of choice for the city 's intellectual elite .
`` It was clear to me that Brearley was running away with the admissions , '' Mrs. Gilbert said .
`` It 's not that I 'm competitive or anything , but I did say , ` Watch out ! '' '
Fifteen years later , Mrs. Gilbert , 66 , is retiring as head of an institution that has given Brearley a good run .
Spanish at Spence now starts in third grade , Japanese in seventh .
There are courses on India , Africa and China .
Minority enrollment is up to 17 percent , and the endowment has reached $ 31 million .
( It was $ 5 million when Mrs. Gilbert took over . )
`` I love to fund-raise , '' Mrs. Gilbert said , which would make her rare among school administrators .
`` I know for a while there was a joke that ` If you get a call from Edes Gilbert for breakfast at the Carlyle , leave your checkbook at home . '' '
Mrs. Gilbert talked last week about her school , her life and her future in her office on East 91st Street overlooking Central Park .
No one has ever called her shy , and she comes with a sense of humor _ probably the essential requirement in running a private girls ' school with any number of rich , famous and self-important parents .
`` School can be a very funny place , '' she said .
Mrs. Gilbert dismissed as a `` minor dust-up '' the 10 weeks last year that Soon-Yi Previn , now Woody Allen 's wife , spent as a Spence student teacher , and said she wondered whatever happened to Shakespeare when the actress Gwyneth Paltrow , the school 's most famous recent alumna , gushed on television about all the women whose works she had read at Spence .
Last spring , after a handful of girls told Spence students and teachers that they considered themselves bisexual , Mrs. Gilbert seemed to take it in stride , and had in a gay psychiatrist to talk to parents .
`` You 're going to find a lot of girls exploring various aspects of their sexuality , '' she said .
`` I think it 's part of growing up in New York City , to tell you the truth .
In fact , I think it would be odd if these girls didn n't think about it . ''
Next week , when Mrs. Gilbert presides over her last Spence commencement , she leaves private girls ' education in good shape .
Like the other retired grandes dames ( Mrs.
Halpert at Brearley , Millie Berendsen at Chapin , Joan McMenamin at Nightingale-Bamford ) , she is convinced that girls thrive free of the pressures of boys .
`` You don n't have to cry , you don n't have to flirt , '' Mrs. Gilbert said .
`` You can just say what 's on your mind . ''

She herself is a product of Vassar , when it was all female , and has spent parts of her life married , divorced and widowed .
From 1970 to 1980 , she worked full-time and was the single parent to three children .
`` That was not easy , '' she said .
Mrs. Gilbert grew up Edes ( pronounced EEDS ) Powell in Brooklyn Heights , descended from New England Yankees like John Edes , the captain of an early 19th - century clipper ship that brought treasures back from China .
Her father , a feature writer for The New York World-Telegram and Sun , died when she was 5 ; her mother wrote for magazines , including an article about traveling with children , for a publication called You .
`` She had all sorts of instructions , '' Mrs. Gilbert said .
`` One of them was ` Keep your child on a harness . ' I was always on a leash .
Which may say more about what kind of child I was . ''
Mrs. Gilbert graduated in 1953 and did what was expected .
`` I got my M.R.S .
pretty quickly , '' she said .
She had three children , but by 1970 the marriage was over .
`` I left him , '' she said .
`` There isn n't a more glamorous way to put it . ''
She taught at a boys ' school near Boston , became headmistress of a private girls ' school in St. Louis and remarried in 1980 .
Her second husband , Peter Gilbert , a cable-system owner , had been part of the Israeli Irgun , or underground ; he fled Vienna , Austria , with his parents , who changed their name from Gans , just ahead of the Nazis .
He died of cancer in 1989 , just three months after Mrs. Gilbert presided over the funeral of a Spence teacher , who had also died of cancer .
`` It was hard , of course , because I knew I was going to lose Peter , '' she said , recalling the silence at the service as both `` beautiful and hard . ''
Mrs. Gilbert will now be a part-time consultant to private schools .
Former heads , she said , are not so much retired as recycled .
And she can always give advice about how to raise money .
`` The reason people don n't like asking for money is because they think of it as raising money , '' she said .
`` I think of it as fulfilling a dream .
So my language is the language of investment : ` Your daughter is in this school .
We want to have the best library we can .
This is what we need to get the job done . '' ' After a first meeting , she said : `` Then you go back and see them .
And at that point , if you haven n't already , you say , ` I hope you 'll consider a gift in the range of .... ' And you have to be careful that you hit a high enough range , so that you 're complimenting them . ''
Also , `` You do not ask for money over breakfast at the Carlyle . ''
