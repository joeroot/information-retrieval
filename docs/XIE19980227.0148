Nigeria 's External Reserve Hits $ 8.1 Billion
LAGOS , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Nigeria has announced that its external reserve has hit 8.1 billion U.S. Dollars by February 24 , an increase of 400 million Dollars from last year 's 7.7 billion Dollars .
This was disclosed by Finance Minister Anthony Ani Thursday in the Nigerian capital Abuja .
Contrary to fears expressed by many economic watchers , the minister said the current weak oil price will not have any significant negative impact on the government 's 1998 budget .
Nigeria , Africa 's top oil producer with a daily production of over two million barrels a day , has more than 80 percent of its budget revenue from oil export .
The government 's 1998 budget projects an average oil price of 17 Dollars a barrel , but as at most time of the first two months , Nigeria 's crude oil has been sold at a much lower price in the international market .
Nigeria 's external reserve has been in a steady rise since last year , sparking off criticism that the government is deliberately propping it up as a proof of its achievement whereas the economy is actually in a serious stagnation .
