Mozambique 's Animal Husbandry on the Rise
MAPUTO , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Mozambique 's animal husbandry has been on the rise over the past three years , with cattle increasing from 293,000 heads in 1995 to 500,000 heads this year .
Meanwhile , the number of sheep has also grown from 435,000 in 1995 to the current 600 , 000 , the Noticias newspaper Monday quoted sources from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as saying .
A survey conducted by the ministry showed that the output of pork , beef and chicken has increased by 96 percent , 30 percent and 105 percent respectively , while milk output has grown by 61 percent .
The ministry attributed the increase to the implementation of the country 's animal husbandry development program , which was initiated since 1992 .
Under the program , the government imports breeding stock and loans them to farmers who will pay back the loan in money or breeding stock when they have the offsprings .
Mozambique had a total of 1.3 million cattle in 1980 .
However , years of civil war which ended in 1992 brought down the cattle number sharply to 254,000 heads that year .
