Top Chinese Scientist Calls for Caution on Information Industry
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- One of China 's top scientists has warned that the information industry will not be the world 's panacea as many predict and that agriculture and basic production skills are still the essential foundations for the society .
Song Jian , president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ( CAE ) made his remarks in an article in a recent issue of the China Science News where he warned that over emphasising the importance of the so-called information industry could lead developing countries to disaster .
" It is a somewhat deceitful perception that the next century will be a society totally focussed on the information industry , " Song added .
" But while I don n't deny the important role it will play in the next century 's economic development , I believe that the production of material goods , food and daily necessities will forever be the foundation of human existence and development , " he wrote .
Song was the Minister of China 's former State Commission of Science and Technology ( now the Ministry of Science and Technology ) before he was elected president of the CAE earlier this year .
Song 's views are readily accepted by some senior Chinese scientists and Zhang Guangdou , an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences , said that the article was very accurate and timely .
