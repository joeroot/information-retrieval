( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) McCAIN , TOBACCO TITANS FACE-OFF OVER SMOKING BILL ( filed in `` a '' and `` w '' categories ) By BENNETT ROTH c.1998 Houston Chronicle
TUCSON , Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain is accustomed to uphill battles .
As a young fighter pilot downed over North Vietnam , he survived more than five years as a prisoner of war .
As a first-term senator , the Arizona Republican overcame a media pounding regarding his association with corrupt savings and loan mogul Charles Keating .
And earlier this year , he defied his own party 's leadership to champion an overhaul of the campaign finance laws .
Now the unpredictable politician who has been toying with running for president in 2000 has taken on another daunting task .
As the chief sponsor of mammoth anti-smoking legislation , McCain has been waging a war with the nation 's tobacco titans .
The measure has made the former two-pack-a-day smoker the darling of the public health community and ally of the Clinton administration , which wants to take a more aggressive role in cracking down on teen-age smoking .
But it has also stirred up hard-core conservative voters in McCain 's party who are deeply suspicious of the steep tobacco price increases and new federal regulations .
The tobacco companies and smokers ' groups have flooded McCain 's home state with ads contending that the legislation is a big government tax scheme that would result in a black market for cigarettes .
The Senate has resumed debate on the issue after a weeklong recess .
Traveling around his home state last week , McCain got a whiff of how the bill was playing , particularly among conservative voters who could be key to any GOP presidential bid .
`` I pretty much have been a supporter of yours , but I do have to disagree on the tobacco thing .
I hate to see any kind of tax increase , '' said Brian , a caller to a local talk radio show where McCain was fielding questions one morning .
`` Don n't people who choose to smoke have rights , too ? ''
asked a veteran at a meeting of McCain supporters preparing for his re-election effort this year .
The senator refused to budge from his support of the anti-smoking measure .
He countered that the tobacco company executives have no credibility and have repeatedly lied to Congress .
But he conceded that the industry 's ads were resonating .
`` Do I resent the tobacco companies doing this to me ?
Well , they are making me famous , '' he said .
A smoker for three decades , the 61-year old lawmaker quit 18 years ago , explaining , `` It was killing me . ''
But the former military man said he doesn n't blame the tobacco companies for addicting him .
`` When I was in the Navy , all the fighter pilots smoked , '' McCain said .
`` It was part of the routine .
Cigarette dangling out of the side of your mouth , standing in the ready room , flight suit unzipped to the navel , '' he said .
But , as a result of the military experience , McCain said he intended to make sure the tobacco legislation included funds to help veterans suffering from smoking-related diseases .
McCain also made it clear he would rather be talking about something else , preferably campaign finance or foreign policy .
He said he will not decide whether to run for president until after the November election , but predicted that potential primary opponents would use the tobacco bill against him .
And he appears to be laying some of the groundwork for a presidential bid .
On Monday he spoke to the Republican Womens Club in New Hampshire , the site of the first presidential primary .
Some of McCain 's constituents view his work with Democrats on such issues as tobacco and campaign finance reform as evidence that he might have broader public appeal .
`` If he wants to be elected ( president ) he needs to look across party lines .
I like it that he considers other people 's ideas , '' said Rodney Short , a 24-year-old University of Arizona student .
McCain has always been somewhat of a maverick .
According to Robert Timberg 's `` The Nightingale 's Song , '' McCain , the son and grandson of Navy admirals , only reluctantly agreed to attend the Naval Academy .
In 1958 he graduated in the bottom fifth of his class at Annapolis , Md. , where Timberg says he became `` the unofficial trail boss for a lusty band of carousers and partygoers known as the Bad Bunch . ''
Shot down over North Vietnam in 1967 , he was imprisoned in the notorious `` Hanoi Hilton . ''
After his first marriage fell apart in the late 1970s , McCain married the daughter of a prominent Arizona beer distributor .
He moved to the state in 1981 and won a Phoenix-area House seat the next year .
An admirer of President Reagan , the rookie congressman nevertheless opposed the decision to send Marines to Lebanon in 1993 .
When the state 's conservative legend , Sen. Barry Goldwater , decided to retire , McCain immediately sought the seat .
Although he handily won in 1986 , McCain was soon engulfed in an ethics scandal for allegedly urging federal regulators to bail out Keating 's failed savings and loan institution .
The lone Republican in the so-called `` Keating Five , '' McCain eventually received a `` mild rebuke '' from the Senate , but he fought back to retain his seat in 1992 .
In recent years McCain has honed a reputation as a thoughtful and independent spokesman on foreign and military policy .
Although critical of many of the Clinton administration foreign policy moves , he backed the president 's decision to re-establish relations with Vietnam .
He has clashed with members of his own party over pork barrel spending , attacking a recent transportation bill he claimed was larded with wasteful highway projects .
Although he has a reputation for a quick temper , McCain also wins over audiences with his outspokenness and irreverent humor .
Prefacing remarks about foreign policy , he told a GOP women 's group , `` I travel quite a bit around the world , usually at your expense . ''
He joked about being jealous that his teen-age daughter had more pictures on her wall of the pretty boy star of the movie `` Titanic , '' Leonardo DiCaprio , than of her father .
`` I detest that androgynous wimp , '' he quipped .
