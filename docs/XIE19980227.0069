Safari Rally Starts off in Kenya
NAIROBI , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Spaniard Carlos Sainz is looking for a record-breaking 22nd world championship victory as the Safari Rally started here on Saturday .
Sainz , winner here six years ago , said on Friday that tyres will play a crucial role as they did in 1997 when he was knocked out by punctures .
Sainz said his Toyota Corolla is strong , but unproven in the Safari , " the roads are rough and the Safari is shorter this time but fast throughout . "
Sainz said he expected tough challenge from Tommi Makinen , winner of the Swedish Rally early in February in a Mitsubishi Lancer , and British former world champion Colin McRae in a Subaru Impreza .
Ford 's leading challenger , three-time Safari champion Juha Kankkunen , said the event has changed from a marathon to a European-type event but it still retains its unique unpredictability .
This year 's Safari is the shortest in the 46-year history of the event with 1,234.44 kilometers of competitive distance divided into 16 stages over three days .
