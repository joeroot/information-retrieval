LaPOINTE 'S PAIN IS RED WINGS ' GAIN ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By JIM REEVES c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
DETROIT _ Do not ask for whom Martin LaPointe 's bells toll , Dallas Stars .
Unfortunately , they still ring for thee .
That 's why he is smiling through the pain .
Two sounds pealed through `` The Joe , '' Sunday afternoon , each in its own way chiming a death knell for the Stars .
`` Ding ! ''
The first came in the opening moments of the game , when the Stars ' Mike Modano broke free to the right of the Wings ' net , silencing the early bedlam of a jam-packed Joe Louis Arena for a frozen moment as he sent a laser shot streaking toward the goal .
The angle wasn n't perfect , but it was good enough , and Modano had Wings ' goalie Chris Osgood dead to rights .
Osgood never saw the screamer , but he heard it .
Everyone from Motor City to west Texas heard it as it whistled past Osgood 's right elbow and clanged off the inside of the far left post .
Somehow _ the `` Joe Jinx '' again ?
_ it didn n't go into the net .
`` The way my luck 's been going , '' Modano sighed , `` why should I be surprised ? ''
`` Dong ! ''
The second , and most ringing moment of all , came less than 10 minutes later when Stars goalie Eddie Belfour snapped during a Wings power play .
Snapped .
Lost it .
Blew it .
In full view of an official , Belfour flagrantly rammed his stick , tip up , between the legs of Wings ' forward LaPointe , yanked him to the ice from behind and drew a backbreaking penalty that gave the Wings a two-man advantage .
As LaPointe slowly skated off , his Wings teammates attacked Belfour like a ravenous wolf on a bloody steak , quickly turning a 1 - 0 lead into a two-goal edge .
Stupid is as stupid does , and when the shouting had stopped , the Stars ' rally to fight back and tie the score had been wasted , and all the explanations had been rolled out and examined , the bottom line was as ugly as the 3 - 1 hole into which the Stars have tumbled in this Western Conference series :
They arguably outplayed the defending Stanley Cup champs in five of six periods here and lost both games because one of the hottest goaltenders in the playoffs has turned softer than the ice at both steamy rinks .
Osgood , the worst goalie left in the playoffs , outplaying `` Eddie the Eagle ? ''
Who could have imagined it ?
`` That 's the best I 've seen Osgood play since I 've been in the league , '' Stars ' coach Ken Hitchcock conceded .
It wasn n't enough that Belfour didn n't play his normally impenetrable defense in front of the Stars ' net _ and yes , he has probably spoiled us _ but to try to turn LaPointe into a falsetto in front of almost 20,000 fans and a very interested referee , was simply indefensible .
`` He 's a young guy , '' Wings coach Scotty Bowman said of LaPointe , `` and he 's married , too .
That just shouldn n't be allowed in hockey . ''
The implication was clear .
Delicate matters were at stake .
`` It 's a very emotional time in a very emotional game , '' Hitchcock contended .
`` You look at it and you say you can n't take that penalty but I think when you 're killing a penalty , the reins have to be loosened a bit .
That 's a call you make 5-on-5 , not 5-on-4 .
`` Eddie wants to see the play , it 's in our zone and it 's a critical time .
He just tried to get him out of his way . ''
Maybe so , but the last time I checked , Belfour doesn n't have a license to perform vasectomies on unwilling patients , even if it is the obnoxious and omnipresent LaPointe .
At least not right in front of the ref .
`` It 's a bad penalty , '' Belfour admitted when he finally emerged to face the media .
`` I shouldn n't take that penalty , especially when we 're already down a man . ''
No , he said , there was no particular provocation , '' but they 're always hacking at your legs , backing into you . ''
LaPointe said he was happy , to a point , to take one for the team , even if it mean a brutal invasion of his `` private area . ''
`` It doesn n't feel good , '' LaPointe said .
`` But it was worth it to get the team on the power play . '
`` That 's just Eddie , '' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said .
`` He just likes to get involved in the game . ''
So did Jack the Ripper .
The Stars valiantly rallied to tie it , but the Wings ' talent _ not a poor Dallas defensive play , like Richard Matvichuk 's on the Detroit 's short-handed first goal , or Belfour 's incredibly stupid lapse of judgment on the second _ provided the winning goal when Slava Kozlov redirected a Larry Murphy sizzler over Belfour 's right shoulder with 8 : 30 to play .
`` It was at a point of the game where the next goal was probably going to win it , '' Bowman said .
And the way the bounces always seem to go here , the odds favored the Wings .
Now the Stars find themselves in a place they haven n't been before in this postseason , facing an elimination game and the prospect of having to beat the good and serendipitous Wings three consecutive times to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals , including at least once in this building in Game 6.
But first they must win at home Wednesday night .
`` We can n't think in terms of being down 3 - 1 in the series , '' Hitchcock said .
`` We just have to try to win a hockey game . ''
It 's that , or ring out the season .
