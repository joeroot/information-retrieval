Traditional Chinese Medicines for U.S. Market
BEIJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- China is promoting traditional Chinese medicine for Western markets with the help of a well-known international pharmaceutical company .
The U.S. 's Covance Inc. is testing two Chinese medicines for cardiovascular disease and will submit them for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
China has over 20,000 types of medicinal herbs and produces 500,000 types of Chinese medicines , but only a small portion of them are exported .
Most medicines that China exports are in the form of raw materials and Chinese medicines now appear in the U.S. as food items .
Covance has signed an agreement with the China Innovation Center for Life Sciences ( CICLS ) , a Chinese medicine promotion institute of the Ministry of Science and Technology to introduce traditional Chinese medicine to the U.S.
Covance Chairman and CEO Chris Kuebler says that Covance will become a bridge between the traditional Eastern approach to medicine and the rigorous standards of Western drug development .
Ma Yonghua , a CICLS official , says that because of various differences , it will take a lot of hard work and three to five years before westerners understand the benefits of the Chinese medicine .
