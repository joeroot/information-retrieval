U.S. Lawmakers Differ on Impeachment , Censure
WASHINGTON , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- President Bill Clinton must state clearly that he lied in the Monica Lewinsky matter before the House of Representatives ' Judiciary Committee can consider any alternative to impeachment , Republican members said Sunday .
But other lawmakers warned not to ignore momentum for the option of censuring the president .
Representative Peter King , a Republican of New York , said that a vote to impeach would fall short in the House and pursuing that course could perpetuate the image that Republicans put the scandal ahead of the nation 's legislative needs .
" It 's going to make it harder to get our agenda across .
We have to show that we can lead , that we can bring an end to this , " he said on NBC 's " Meet the Press . "
But the move to censure was complicated last week by Republicans ' dissatisfaction with Clinton 's answers to 81 questions concerning the affair , which were presented to him by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde , Republican of Illinois .
" This censure idea without an admission on the president 's part is a political cop-out , " committee member Lindsey Graham , a Republican , told NBC .
" I do not want to have an unrepentant perjurer leading the nation into the 21st century . "
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay said on CNN 's " Late Edition , " " The Congress and the House have no other option but to vote impeachment or not . "
Clinton or his representatives have been invited to testify before the committee on December 8 , but White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the White House is still evaluating how to respond to the invitation .
One Senate Republican , Arlen Specter , said on " Fox News Sunday " that Clinton should personally appear to defend himself .
After that , the committee is to decide whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House , which could take up the matter the following week .
If 218 House members vote to impeach , action would move to the Senate where a two-thirds majority , or 67 votes , are needed to convict and remove the president from office .
With opinions split down party lines , there is little chance of that happening .
The first House Democrat to urge Clinton to resign over the affair , Paul McHale of Pennsylvania , said on NBC that while the president 's alleged offenses may be impeachable , it would be " profoundly unwise " for the House to impeach him on a party-line vote " against the manifest will of the American people . "
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Orrin Hatch , a Republican , said he saw a " 50 - 50 chance " that the House would refer articles of impeachment to the Senate .
He said he would meet with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , Democratic leader Tom Daschle and others to prepare for that possibility .
Censure comes into the picture , Hatch said , if it 's clear the Senate doesn n't have the 67 votes to convict .
The question becomes , he said on ABC 's " This Week , " " Do you just let the president off scot-free . "
