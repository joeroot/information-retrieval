Security Council Calls for End to Hostilities in Angola
UNITED NATIONS , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.N. Security Council Wednesday issued a presidential statement , calling for " an immediate cessation of hostilities , " and urging the rebel UNITA to " comply immediately and without conditions with its obligations " to save the long-stalled peace process in the African country .
" The Security Council deplores the serious deterioration of the situation in Angola and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities , " the presidential statement said .
" The Security Council demands that UNITA comply immediately and without conditions with its obligations and reiterates that only a political settlement , on the basis of the relevant agreements and resolutions , will bring a lasting peace on Angola , " the statement said .
Meanwhile , the statement urged the Government of Angola and UNITA to cooperate with the special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General , Issa Diallo , including by facilitating his contacts with all those key to reviving the stalled peace process and to implementing the Lusaka Protocol , signed in 1994 .
The statement stressed that " the primary responsibility for the failure to achieve peace in Angola clearly lies with the leadership " of UNITA , short form for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola .
The Security Council issued the presidential statement shortly after fresh fighting was raging on in central Angola , killing 26 people and wounding two dozens others .
Two sides signed a much-vaunted peace accord in 1994 , but UNITA violated its terms by rearming its forces and retaking territory it had ceded to government control .
The rebel group financed its operations by mining and illicit marketing of diamonds , despite several international trade and arms embargoes against the rebels , reports said .
Since the start of the government 's offensive in early December , the fighting has centered on Bie province where UNITA has its key bases in the towns of Bailundo and Andulo .
The Angolan Government and UNITA have been at war for most of the past 23 years since the nation 's independence in 1975 .
