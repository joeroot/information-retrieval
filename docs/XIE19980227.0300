New Pig Virus Rekindles Fears About Animal Transplants
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- A previously unknown virus in pigs discovered in Australia has rekindled fears about the safety of transplanting animal organs into human patients .
The virus , which caused deformities and stillbirths among pigs , also infected two piggery workers who developed severe flu-like symptoms , the New Scientist magazine reported Thursday .
One of the biggest question marks over the future of cross-species organ transplants is the potential of introducing animal viruses into the human population .
Proponents have argued that animal organs can be screened for viruses before use .
" But you can n't screen for disease agents that you don n't know about , " virologist Peter Kirkland was quoted by the magazine as saying .
Kirkland was a member of a large scientific team which tracked down the cause of a disease which swept through a piggery near Sydney .
The team traced the virus to a colony fo grey-headed fruit bats that were living near the piggery .
They believe the bat is the host for the disease .
The virus , which only attacked pig foetuses , has not been found in pig products or other people who may have been exposed to it .
The two infected piggery workers also recovered .
Although the virus was contained , " there is nothing to say that it won n't break out again , " Kirkland warned .
