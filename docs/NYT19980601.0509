& UR ; NETWORK _ & LR ; Monica Frei , head of a Bay Area nanny placement service , had all the people skills she needed to spot a good housekeeper , nanny or personal assistant .
But until recently she was almost too petrified even to touch a computer .

By Laura Castaneda
& UR ; SMALLWEB & LR ; _ It seemed like a bad omen for small businesses when Saks Fifth Avenue gave up on electronic commerce earlier this year .
