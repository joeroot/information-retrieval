MEMO TO STARS : SKIP BACK SLAPPING , LEARN LESSON
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) EDS : CORRECTS SLUG By JIM REEVES c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
DETROIT _ Bring on the dead octopuses .
They can n't be near as rancid as what the Stars threw out on the ice for the first two periods last night at Joe Louis Arena .
Smelly .
Slimy .
Putrid .
You couldn n't find a week-old , dead eight-legger more rotten than a Stars team that not only forgot what got it here , but got caught up trying to out-Wing the Red Wings , connoisseurs of the fly-and-sigh offense , and failed miserably .
And then , for 15 minutes of the third period , the Stars nearly scared the scarlet britches off the defending Stanley Cup champs and their fans , who sat stunned by a furious Stars rally that might have turned into the biggest comeback in franchise history if not for one final ignominious moment by goalie Eddie Belfour on easily his worst night of the playoffs , if not his life .
If Game 2 was a must-win contest for the Stars , then the Red Wings ' humiliating , 5 - 3 thumping of the intruders from Texas guarantees even more desperation hockey in Game 4 tomorrow afternoon with Detroit leading the best-of-seven series 2 - 1.
This game was over five minutes into the second period when , in an 80-second span , the Wings pumped two goals past the nearly comatose Belfour for a 4 - 0 lead .
Over .
Kaput .
Finished .
The no-offense Stars down by four goals and the Wings on a rampage with half the game to play ?
No way , Jose .
`` It was verging on getting very embarrassing , '' Mike Modano admitted .
`` That much time to play and the way those guys can fill up the net ... ''
There wasn n't a soul in Joe Louis Arena not dressed in Dallas black who didn n't figure it was all done but for the traditional octopus cookout .
Don n't tell me you didn n't think so , too .
But , determined to give the Wings something to think about , here came the Stars , 1 - 2-3 , as in goals flying past the Wings ' own papier-mache netminder Chris Osgood .
With the fans silenced , the Wings on their heels , the Stars riding the momentum of their three-goal explosion off the sticks of Jere Lehtinen ( twice ) and Modano , there was nothing farfetched about thinking that this game was headed to overtime , if not an outright Dallas victory .
But it was Belfour , who has spent 99 percent of the playoffs standing on his head , taking a swan dive _ literally _ that made the Stars rally ultimately meaningless .
Belfour 's penchant for straying too far from the crease took him all the way into the left corner to chase down a dying puck .
As he swiped it around behind his goal , he was brushed by Wings forward Martin Lapointe .
Obviously hoping to draw a penalty , Belfour sprawled to the ice .
No whistle .
As Belfour scrambled to his skates and rushed tardily back to his position , Vyacheslav Kozlov passed to Lapointe , who had stationed himself 15 feet in front of the Dallas goal .
He drilled it into the net on the late-arriving Belfour 's glove side .
Did the `` Eagle '' embellish the fall ?
No question about it .
`` I didn n't think ( Lapointe ) made too much contact with Eddie , '' center Brian Skrudland said candidly .
`` That wasn n't one of Eddie 's best nights , '' coach Ken Hitchcock understated .
`` But he 's carried us since the Olympic break .
I 'm not going to sit here and criticize anything Eddie does . ''
Some of us aren n't quite so loyal .
Then again , the scariest part of the whole ugly evening came in the postgame news conference when Hitchcock raved about his team 's play in front a nearly speechless room of reporters ready to write its obit .
`` The best five-on-five we 've played all year , '' Hitchcock insisted .
`` If we can continue to keep up our energy and play five-on-five like that , we 'll be fine . ''
Hello .
Earth to Hitch .
Maybe he was still feeling the effects of his foray into nearby Greektown for a Friday night dinner he said afterward he didn n't recognize either time he saw it .
Or perhaps he was just doing the obligatory , losing coach spin-doctoring .
If so , give him credit for putting on a much better performance than Belfour , who will win no Oscars for his dive at a crucial part of the game .
`` At that stage , you just want to keep playing the game , '' Hitchcock said .
`` We had a good bead on things until they put in that final goal . ''
At least his players weren n't trying to float anything the Detroit River hasn n't seen before .
`` A terrible first 40 minutes , '' Modano said .
`` We definitely didn n't play well , that 's for sure , '' chimed in Jamie Langenbrunner .
`` We gave them too many opportunities and didn n't take advantage of our own .
`` We kind of got reeled into playing their game as we fell behind .
But when you 're down 4 - 0 , what have you got to lose ? ''
Leave it to the down-to-earth Skrudland to sum it up best .
`` We can congratulate each other , saying we played hard and came back , and slap each other on the back , '' he said , `` but we 're not fooling anyone . ''
I doubt they 're even fooling Hitch , as much as he tried to convince us .
Let 's hope the Stars learned a painful if obvious lesson last night .
All those first-period shots might have looked pretty , they might have even gotten the coach excited , but that 's not this team 's game and it 's not what got them here .
Write it down : They can n't fly with the Wings anymore than a dead octopus can .
