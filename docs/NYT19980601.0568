1998 , Houston Chronicle SALT LAKE CITY _ If ever there was a chance for Michael Jordan to lose in the NBA Finals , this is it .
That 's not speculation or theory .
Or even wishful thinking .
That 's what at least a couple of the NBA 's most knowledgeable insiders believe as Jordan and the Chicago Bulls prepare for a rematch against the Utah Jazz in the Finals , which begin Wednesday at the Delta Center .
Last season , Chicago needed only six games to dispense with the Jazz and earn championship No. 5 in the '90s .
Now , the Bulls start working on the other hand 's rings .
But the Jazz is better prepared this year to sabotage the Bulls .
`` Those are the favorites , '' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said in a mini-preview of the Finals .
`` Through the 82-game season , they proved to be the best teams on each side .
`` What I think we 'll see in Utah is a team that has been there and has a great deal of experience to draw on regarding what happened last year .
I think you 'll see a tougher team .
`` And the big difference is they have the home-court advantage .
So I think , psychologically , they really have to be feeling good about themselves . ''
Tomjanovich is not alone in his belief that the Jazz has an excellent chance of knocking off the Bulls .
`` I will say this : For the first time since Jordan and the Bulls started their championship run , this is the best chance anybody 's had ( to beat them ) , '' said Denver general manager Dan Issel .
`` Why ?
Because the Jazz ( is ) playing well right now , ( will ) have home court and ( will ) have a lot of confidence .
`` If the Jazz can n't do it , let 's say nobody can do it . ''
Utah has a chance to end Jordan 's season on an unhappy note for just the second time since 1990 .
Only when Jordan was making his comeback from baseball in 1995 did the Bulls lose a playoff series in which he participated , getting bumped by Orlando in the second round .
Now , the Bulls seem vulnerable again , at least in the eyes of onlookers .
Anybody who saw the way Indiana played so tough against the Bulls , forcing them to an all-or-nothing seventh game in the Eastern Conference finals , could tell these are the waning days of the Chicago dynasty .
And with the Jazz capable of playing even tougher defense than the Pacers did , it 's logical to see why the Bulls wouldn n't be prohibitive favorites in the Finals .
Is the Jazz ready to dethrone Michael ?
Only the next two weeks will tell .
But Utah coach Jerry Sloan said he believes his team certainly is better equipped this time around than it was last year when the Jazz was making its first trip to a Finals .
`` I just hope we come with the determination to play rather than just show up , '' Sloan said .
`` I think last year in the Finals , we went in there with the determination to show up .
I think that was evident in that second game , where it looked like we were happy to be there , and we got slaughtered on the road .
`` When you 're going to play at that level , hopefully you come to play with every bit of energy you have .
Hopefully , we 'll do that in the series ahead of us , because if we don n't , that team will put you away . ''
The biggest question going into the series is how Utah 's nine days off between games will impact Karl Malone , John Stockton , Jeff Hornacek and Co. All three of the Jazz 's key players put the time off to good use , letting some nagging injuries heal .
But no player enjoys sitting around for more than a week before starting a playoff series , especially when the opponent wasn n't known until Sunday .
The Jazz has won 10 of its past 11 playoff games since falling behind 2 - 1 to the Rockets in the first round .
Utah clearly was on a roll before this dominatius interruptus .
`` We were starting to get there , '' Malone said .
`` We 're not there yet .
But we 're getting closer .
I 'll let you know when we get there ( and are playing our best ) . ''
Malone agreed with his coach that the experience gained last season should help significantly this time around .
`` I think last year we weren n't in awe of them , '' Malone said .
`` It was more like we were upset more than anything , because we knew we belonged , and we felt like we let it slip away . ''
The question , then , is whether the Jazz can put all of its knowledge to work in the Finals and put the pressure squarely on the Bulls , who have never known the tight feeling that goes along with returning home in a 2 - 0 hole , which they will do in this series if Utah holds serve in the first leg of the 2 - 3-2 format .
`` We don n't know if that 's going to work in our favor or not , '' Sloan said .
`` We 've never had the home-court advantage in a 2 - 3-2 . ''
And unlike last season , the Jazz knows that if it wins the rest of its home games , it will be champion of the world in two weeks .
But getting there won n't be easy .
