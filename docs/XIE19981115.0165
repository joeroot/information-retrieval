U.N. Meeting on Climate Change Closes
BUENOS AIRES , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- The United Nations Conference on Climate Change closed here Saturday without signing any important document .
The conference decided to postpone until the year 2000 the application of three mechanisms contained in the Kyoto protocol to reduce the emission of greenhouse effect gases that cause the climate change on the planet .
The conference , scheduled to complete its discussions on Friday , continued until Saturday morning because of profound disagreements between developed and developing countries over the reduction of the emissions .
The conference called on governments to speed up the implementation of the Kyoto protocol urging the developed countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse effect gases between the years 2008 and 2012 to the 1990 levels .
Representatives from developing countries requested that the developed countries actively fulfill their commitments in the Convention of Kyoto and establish an effective mechanism for technology transfer and financial support .
The conference also called on the international community to assist Central American countries recently ravaged by Hurricane Mitch , which left at least 10,000 people dead and tens of thousands missing .
The United Nations Convention on the Climate Change , which was approved in June 1992 at the Summit for Development and the Environment in Rio de Janeiro and went into force on March 21 , 1994 , has been the central theme of international efforts to combat the earth 's warming up .
The current conference , the fourth of its kind , started on November 2 with the participation of more than 4,000 government representatives , observers , and non-governmental organizations .
The previous three conferences were held in Berlin ( 1995 ) , Geneva ( 1996 ) and Kyoto ( 1997 ) .
