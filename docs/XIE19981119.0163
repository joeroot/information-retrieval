Tanzania Stresses Agriculture in Poverty
DAR ES SALAAM , November 19 ( Xinhua ) - Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has urged local governments in the country to eradicate poverty by developing agriculture as the top priority , a government press release said Thursday .
Mkapa told officials at a meeting in northern city of Moshi Wednesday that new farming methods must be adopted to promote production in agriculture , the backbone of the country 's economy .
" Agriculture has not been of great help to peasants as a means for eradicating poverty , hence leaving the majority of Tanzanians without assured food supply , " he said when opening the 14th general meeting of the Association of Local Authorities in Tanzania ( ALAT ) .
The president asked the officials to stimulate agriculture and livestock production by providing basic social services and making bylaws regarding land policy , environmental protection , proper use of seeds and fertilizers .
Mkapa blamed some local organs for being busy only with tax collection while ignoring the fact that underfed Tanzanians could not be good tax payers .
" It is only through revamped agriculture that the majority of tax payers will be able to improve their standard of life and fight the prevailing poverty in the country , " he added .
" Good governance will be a meaningless concept if majority of Tanzanians lead a miserable life , " he stressed .
Mkapa urged ALAT leaders to strengthen democratic practices toward people-oriented development in all aspects of life .
The president expressed fears that the wide development disparities emerging among various regions and districts in the country could endanger the national unity .
" Fresh steps must be taken to rectify this development gap , " he warned .
" Stern legal measures will also be taken against any unscrupulous officials . "
