Zambians Demanded to Surrender Illegal Guns
LUSAKA , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Zambian government has offered a seven-day general amnesty for people with illegal firearms to surrender them to the police .
The move follows a spate of robberies that have rocked the capital city Lusaka and the Copperbelt .
Alex Chilufya , Police Public Relation Officer said here Saturday that the amnesty was effective from Saturday midnight , Times of Zambia reported Sunday .
The police officer announced on behalf of the government that illegal weapons , especially military firearms , should be surrendered to the nearest police stations and the owners would not be prosecuted for not being licensed .
Chilufya , however , added that those in possession of military weapons would not be allowed to get licenses .
He warned that any person who failed to take advantage of the amnesty should be met with stern police action and hoped that the public would cooperate during the exercise .
The officer specifically mentioned Lusaka and the Copperbelt as the most targeted areas .
The police would not compromise with anyone who ignored the government 's goodwill , he said .
Armed bandits have of late been terrorizing Lusaka and Copperbelt residents at will .
A number of petrol filling stations in the capital have been robbered on several occasions .
