THE GROWNUP WORLD OF JUDY BLUME

LYKE c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
SEATTLE _ She worried she would never finish writing the book .
She worried no one would read it when she did .
She worried they would read it and hate it .
She worried no one would show up at the book signings on her 12-city tour .
`` I 'm very insecure about my writing , '' Judy Blume confesses , spearing a steamed turnip at The Painted Table in downtown Seattle during a lunchtime interview Thursday to promote her steamy new adults-only novel `` Summer Sisters '' ( Delacorte Press , 400 pages , $ 21.95 ) .
Blume , who became a household name after selling an astounding 65 million books for children and young adults , sniffs the turnip suspiciously .
She worries it 's an onion .
And she worries onions will upset a delicate stomach .
Her husband , law professor-turned-writer George Cooper , smiles across the table .
This is the woman who worries over tragedies that could happen on the way to the airport , then frets over the possibility of the plane crashing .
This is the woman who keeps a running `` Anxiety Diary '' on her Internet site _ www.judyblume.com _ chronicling her tribulations with `` Summer Sisters , '' a book that required 20 drafts and some painful soul-searching over the two-plus years it took to write it .
`` I promise myself I won n't become obsessed by reviews ...
I won n't read the bad ones more than once .
Maybe twice .
I 'll focus on the good ones _ if there are any good ones , '' Blume writes in her tell-all online diary .
Frankness has always been Blume 's forte .
Asked about the R-rated sex scenes in `` Summer Sisters '' _ her first adult novel in more than 10 years _ she doesn n't blink .
`` I know it 's sexy if I get turned on when I 'm writing it , '' says the writer , who turned 60 in February but says she 's still 12 inside .
Her husband leans forward .
`` That comment 's going to show up in the newspaper , '' he warns .
Blume smiles , a quick , broad smile that sets off high cheekbones , a pert nose and silky skin beneath a curly mop parted at the side and highlighted with strawberry blond .
She looks miles from 60 .
`` That 's OK , '' Blume says , merriment playing in the warm brown eyes .
`` It 's the truth . ''
The truth is what has catapulted Blume 's 20-plus coming-of-age books onto the top of best-seller lists and into the collective preadolescent imagination the past two decades .
It is what has kept America 's kids up past midnight , reading Blume under the covers with a flashlight .
Novels such as `` Are You There God ?
It 's Me , Margaret , '' `` Forever , '' `` Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing '' and `` Blubber '' have unflinchingly tackled subjects like wet dreams , the longing to belong , death , divorce ( Blume 's been through two herself ) , the cruelty of kids , masturbation and , of course , `` menstroo-ation . ''
Complaints about offensive language and blunt subject matter have regularly landed the novels on banned-book lists at schools and libraries .
`` I 've received numerous letters over the years telling me I 'll burn in Hell , '' says Blume , named the most frequently challenged author of the last 15 years by the anti-censorship group People for the American Way .
She has become a spokeswoman for the National Coalition Against Censorship .
`` There 's much more censorship today than when I started writing , '' she says .
Blume , a child who made up stories as she bounced the ball against a wall , didn n't launch her literary career until her late 20s .
She was a bored housewife with small kids in New Jersey , `` going crazy . ''
All the first stories rhymed .
And all were rejected .
Her neighbors thought she was weird to want to be a writer .
`` A lot of people tried to discourage me , '' says Blume , who vividly recalls her first book signing at a New Jersey bookstore .
The book was `` The One in the Middle is the Green Kangaroo . ''
Her children showed up .
A few of their friends .
Her mother .
But the rest of the chairs remained yawningly empty .
Maybe visions of that non-event play in the back of her mind as Blume dabbles with her steamed veggies at The Painted Table _ no canola oil , she 's allergic , she tells the waiter .
She is worried about her reading in a few hours at Elliott Bay Book Co. It 's set for 5 o ' clock . `` Do you think people will show up at that hour ? ''
Blume asks .
But the reading room at Elliott Bay is packed with Blume fans , male and female , who raise their hands to thank her for her honesty , her humor , her battles against censorship .
They nod knowingly when she asks if they grew up on her books .
`` When I was 11 and reading her , I always thought she was the one writer who knew what everyone was thinking .
She always seemed to be in synch with how I felt , '' said Elizabeth Zambelli , 24 .
`` She simplified a lot of complicated stuff . ''
Simplifying a lot of complicated stuff hasn n't always set well with critics .
While some praise Blume 's roll-up-the-sleeves realism , others dismiss her writing as `` trivial '' or `` second-rate . ''
In the most recent Blume-bashing , Sarah Towers _ writing in this month 's Mirabella magazine _ complains that the book about first sex , `` Forever , '' ruined her sex life forever .
`` The crime was not that she ( Blume ) was writing about sex for kids , '' Towers writes , `` but that she was writing badly about it . ''
But critics don n't buy books .
The public buys books .
And the public can n't seem to get enough of Judy Blume 's catchy stories , easy prose and emotional rawness .
`` My success has always come from readers , not from critics , '' says the writer .
And Blume readers are sure to plunge headlong into the nostalgically titillating waters of `` Summer Sisters , '' a page turner that is No. 9 on Publishers Weekly 's best-seller list .
The book is set on Martha 's Vineyard , where Blume and Cooper spend part of the year , with other homes in Key West and New York City .
It is dedicated to Mary Weaver , Blume 's best friend since seventh grade .
Nevertheless , Blume insists it 's her least autobiographical book .
`` After 22 books , you 've pretty much mined your own life , '' she says .
`` If you haven n't , you 're in trouble . ''
The story , which germinated in Blume 's head for 10 years , begins with two 12-year-old girls and follows their tangled friendship and sexual experimentations over the course of two decades .
The main character , Victoria , or `` Vix , '' is a reserved , thoughtful girl from a working-class family , who is developing a voluptuous body .
`` I allow my characters to live out my fantasies , '' says Blume , teasingly opening her sea-grass green wool jacket to reveal a modest bust line under her Banana Republic T-shirt .
Victoria 's friend , Caitlin , a wild , flashy , manipulative golden girl from a well-to-do family , invites Vix to summer at the Vineyard .
The invitation , and what ensues from it , transforms Victoria 's life .
It 's hardly Dostoevski .
And while the adolescent voices sing , the adult voices tend to fall flat .
But Blume 's ability to map that tentative territory between what people think and what they say is intriguing _ and the ongoing chorus of animal moans that emanate from the book 's tousled beds and backs of cars keeps the pages cooking .
`` I have a naughty streak , '' admits Blume , with a devilish smile .
That smile teeters when she begins talking about upcoming projects .
Her 6-year-old grandson , whose first word was `` book , '' loves her Fudge books _ `` Superfudge , '' `` Fudge-a-mania . ''
He wants her to write one for him and dedicate it to him .
She also has another adult book taking shape in the notebooks full of character sketches and observations she calls her security blankets .
Blume 's face grows thoughtful .
`` Will I ever write it ? ''
she wonders aloud .
The insecurities kick in and her mind begins to spin .
She leans close , for a soft confession .
`` Sometimes I think I don n't want to do this anymore , '' she admits in a voice that 's almost a whisper .
`` It 's too hard , too painful .
`` But then I think , you don n't decide whether to write or not .
`` You just have to do it . ''
And that 's OK .
Because it 's the truth .
