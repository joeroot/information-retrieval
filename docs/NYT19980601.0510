MERGER GIVES MONSANTO CHIEF BIG WINDFALL PROFIT
( With AHP-MONSANTO ) ( sw ) By GRETCHEN MORGENSON c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ John Stafford , chief executive of American Home Products , and Robert Shapiro , his counterpart at Monsanto , emphasized on Monday that the $ 34.4 billion stock-for-stock deal they had just constructed was a merger of equals .
But as is almost always the case in life , one player in this high-stakes game is more equal than the other .
After the merger , the men say they will be co-chief executives with equal footing .
But thanks to Shapiro 's unusual executive compensation plan , the deal will put him several rungs above Stafford on the windfall profit ladder .
Not that either executive is going to the poorhouse anytime soon .
After all , Stafford was paid $ 6.4 million last year in total compensation ; Shapiro pulled in $ 3.6 million .
But the real payday comes when stock options held by the executives are exercised .
Because the deal is a merger of equals and not an acquisition of one company by another , compensation experts say it is a near certainty that any options held by the chiefs will automatically be exercisable when the merger is completed .
This makes for several ironies .
Although Stafford of the American Home Products Corp. runs the bigger and more profitable of the two companies , Monsanto 's man will bag the bigger stock option windfall if the combination goes through .
According to figures compiled by Jim Dalton at Compensation Resource Group in Pasadena , Calif. , Shapiro will reap nearly $ 73.6 million in stock option gains from the deal ; Stafford 's stock option gain will be $ 48.3 million .
Here is how the companies stack up : Monsanto generated revenues of $ 7.5 billion last year ; American Home 's sales were $ 14.2 billion .
American Home 's profit margins have been consistently superior to Monsanto 's _ operating margins were 25.6 percent versus 22.2 for Monsanto last year .
American Home earned 50 percent more than Monsanto last year .
But there is another irony to this deal .
In executive compensation circles , Shapiro has been celebrated as a man who holds his managers ' feet _ as well as his own _ to the fire , pegging a portion of everybody 's pay to the performance of Monsanto 's stock .
In 1996 and 1997 , for instance , Monsanto put in place a so-called premium option program for its top executives .
Under the 1997 plan , premium options could be exercised only after the stock price had risen 50 percent from its $ 50 price at the time the plan was announced .
That meant the executives could not cash in those options until the stock hit $ 75 .
The options also had to be held for a minimum of one year .
As chief executive , Shapiro stood a very good chance of winning big on his premium options , which accounted for the lion 's share of his option position .
But unlike other corporate chiefs who win regardless of whether their shareholders do , Shapiro put his compensation at risk to a bad performance by his stock .
For this , he won kudos from those critical of astronomical pay packages for corporate leaders .
After all , Shapiro was to win big only if shareholders did , too .
That was then .
Upon completion , the deal announced on Monday with American Home Products , which is based in Madison , N.J . , will eliminate the risk that Shapiro had in his options plans .
And Monsanto 's stock did not have to get close to $ 75 for him to get his reward .
Shareholders in Monsanto , which is based in St. Louis , were not as lucky ; it fell 87.5 cents , to $ 54.50 , on Monday 's news .
American Home gained 93.75 cents , to $ 49.25 .
There will be no premium paid to either company 's shareholders .
Monsanto 's shares had crept higher since January on rumors that it would be acquired ; in January , the stock was around $ 39 .
Wall Street has also cheered the company 's shift from a politically incorrect chemical company to a eco-trendy bioscience concern .
It trades at almost 50 times next year 's earnings estimates , nearly double American Home 's multiple of 26 .
According to Eric Marquardt , managing director of the Compensation Resource Group 's Chicago office , the merger might not trigger the option gains had Shapiro held a more traditional option program .
That is because the Monsanto plan was based specifically on characteristics of the company 's stock _ volatility , for example _ that will be moot when combined with another company like American Home .
One question on everyone 's lips on Monday was how will Shapiro and Stafford manage as co-chief executives ?
The men could not be more different in management styles .
American Home is staid and conservative and said to be run by lawyers and accountants ; Monsanto is almost new age .
Its divisions are run by teams , not individuals .
And it recently eliminated all its executives ' offices , putting high-ranking officials in cubicles alongside staff members .
Offices of the former executives are now plant-filled meeting rooms with names like Spring , Renaissance and other appropriately `` green '' names .
One clue to how the executives will coexist may be found in the way they resolve the great difference in their pay .
While American Home has a traditional executive pay program that focuses on cash compensation and plain-vanilla options , Monsanto 's packages allow for more ownership and more bells and whistles .
`` One of the toughest challenges will be getting these approaches to meld , '' Marquardt said .
`` But the resolution of these things is usually to raise the bar . ''
By raising the bar , Marquardt means that Shapiro 's salary and bonus _ $ 1.76 million last year _ will probably be brought in line with Stafford 's more generous level of $ 2.5 million .
Total cash compensation for the chief executives of the combined company would be $ 5 million .
Stock options would be additional .
Pretty rich stuff .
Especially when compared with the $ 2.6 million paid to Raymond Gilmartin , chief executive of Merck .
If Marquardt is right , this exceedingly well-run drug industry giant , about 15 percent larger than the combined American Home-Monsanto , could very well have a chief who costs half as much .
Talk about shareholder value .
