HK Communities Urged to Join in Youth Development
HONG KONG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Hong Kong 's Commission on Youth Monday called on the entire community including the government , families , schools , employers , media , non-governmental organizations and youth groups to join hands in nurturing and developing young people .
During a press briefing to announce the findings and recommendations of the Study on Civic Awareness and Moral Values of Youth , Eric Li , chairman of the Commission on Youth , said that youth development is the responsibility of the community as a whole .
The commission began the study after it was asked by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) last October to do a study on how the young people could play a more active role in building up the SAR and in voluntary work .
Li said that the major findings of the study are that most young people possess positive values which are recognized and accepted by the community .
But there are noticeable perception and expectation gaps on the part of adults regarding young people 's civic awareness and value system , Li said .
" Overall , we believe that our young people have the potential to face the challenges of the new millennium and to take an active part in building up the SAR , " Li said .
On the recommendations of the study , Li said that a three-prong approach was suggested to help young people realize their full potential .
Firstly , the widely held positive values among the young people should be reinforced and promoted , Li said .
Secondly , to meet the training needs of the young people , structured leadership training programs should be devised on a continuing basis , he said .
" Thirdly , we call for full community ownership of the responsibility for nurturing and developing our young people , with the government taking the lead , " Li stressed .
The community should give more opportunities for young people to develop their potential and widen their vista , Li said .
Li said that voluntary service can help cultivate a caring attitude and a sense of responsibility and exchange programs with China 's mainland and other countries can help them understand their country better and widen their perspective , Li said .
