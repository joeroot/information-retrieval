( For use by clients of the New York Times News Service ) Virtual Phone System for Businesses Sounds Like the Real Deal By Jonathan Marshall c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle In this era of virtual companies , it was just a matter of time before someone invented a virtual phone system .
The CrossPoint VirtualPBX is just that .
It lets small firms whose employees frequently work from home or on the road look to the rest of the world like a big office with a $ 100,000 phone system .
And the best part is , there 's no up-front investment .
The service is offered by Advanced Queuing Systems in San Francisco ( & LR ; www.aqsys.com & LR ; ) .
AQS put all the fancy telephone-switch intelligence in its computer network , freeing customers from having to pay for and install a complex phone system in their offices .
Each customer gets a toll-free 800 or 888 number for incoming calls .
When a caller dials an employee extension , the call is routed to any of several numbers specified by the employee , such as a home number , branch office , cell phone , pager or a client site .
Custom music or messages play while the caller waits for the transfer .
The system also comes with voice mail , call screening , dial-by-name directories and a fancy feature called automated call distribution , or ACD , usually found only in high-end systems .
ACD routes calls to the next available person in a queue _ for example , for incoming sales or technical support calls .
Customers pay for the system by the minute .
Incoming or outgoing calls within the Bay Area cost 10 cents a minute , within the rest of California 11 cents a minute and outside the state 16 cents a minute .
There also is a small annual maintenance fee that varies with the size of the workforce .
& UR ; & LR ; Stephen Lange , co-founder of AQS , said one customer using the service is an insurance company with offices in San Francisco , Hayward , San Jose and Oakland .
Previously , the company needed phone switches in each office , and expensive T1 lines connecting them at a cost of thousands of dollars a month .
But with the virtual PBX , callers can be transferred seamlessly to agents in any office .
The Center for Human Function and Work in Boulder , Colo. , uses the CrossPoint VirtualPBX to link with a dozen or so professors at the University of Colorado who conduct joint research with the center on work-management issues .
As new associates join the center , extensions can be quickly added and forwarded to university offices or other locations without callers ever knowing .
The center began using the service in February and already finds it indispensable , said the center 's director , Robert Levin .
Levin also likes the fact that he is not buying equipment that will rapidly become obsolete .
`` If we go buy a ( phone system ) now , I 'm stuck with what I just invested in , '' Levin said .
`` But AQS is continually improving the service , and I 'm not paying for the upgrades . ''
In a recent review , Computer Telephony magazine gave the AQS service high marks , calling it `` very robust , '' `` very cool '' and `` great for startup companies with employees at multiple locations or no dedicated office . ''
Rick Luhmann , the magazine 's editor , said he liked the service so much that he subscribed to it for use at his San Francisco office .
AQS also markets the service to companies that want a contingency plan in case their phone system ever fails .
Companies back up their computers , why not their phones ?
This unique product , called the CrossPoint PBXParachute , looks to the outside world exactly like a firm 's existing phone system .
But in case of emergency , it forwards all incoming calls to backup locations , such as home phones , cell phones or satellite offices .
