NZ Government Intends to Cut Social Welfare Spending
WELLINGTON , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The New Zealand government intends to cut social welfare spending as part of its response to the economic downturn .
The Evening Post , a Wellington-based newspaper , reported Monday that the National-led minority government is lobbying independent members of Parliament to get their support for a package of measures it plans to announce in the next few weeks .
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley foreshadowed a tightening of spending last week when she called on the community to debate what services should be available universally and " which we should target to people with specific needs . "
She also announced that the government would try to revamp accident compensation .
James Funnell , spokesman for the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade , told Xinhua Monday morning that the ministry is reviewing the costs of its 48 embassies , high commissions and consulates overseas and could be forced to close some of them because of financial pressures .
According to the latest economic forecast released by the New Zealand Treasury , the country will suffer a negative economic growth of 0.5 percent in the year to March 1999 and the government will have a deficit of 700 million NZ dollars in 1999 - 2000 and 300 million NZ dollars the year after .
But local economists hold that the economic situation in New Zealand is more serious than the government 's forecasts .
It is reported that the New Zealand government also intends to sell state-owned electricity generator Contact Energy , which could return 800 million to one billion NZ dollars to prevent its accounts from being plunged into the red .
The intended cuts in social welfare spending would follow the cutting of 600 million NZ dollars ( 304 million U.S. dollars ) in the government 's spending earlier this year .
