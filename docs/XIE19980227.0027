EU to Verify Mozambican Fish Contamination
MAPUTO , February 26 ( Xinhua ) The European Union is to send a team to Mozambique to check if the fish the country has been exporting to the European market is contaminated as reported .
The Mozambican News Agency quoted Minister of Agriculture and Fishery Carlos do Rosario as saying Thursday that if the team prove the fish here is clean from cholera pollution as suspected by some Europeans , EU would lift the ban on Mozambiqaue 's fish export .
Rosario said that the team is to arrive in Maputo in a few days .
The team would also visit Kenya , Tanzania and Uganda , the countries which have been banned from exporting fish to Europe after cholera erupted in mid-1997 .
The minister said the dispatch of the EU team is a result of several talks between the Mozambican government and EU .
Rosario said that experts have reached a conclusion that the fish from Mozambique is free from cholera contamination .
Mozambique loses about 600,000 U.S. Dollars each month after the EU imposed the fish ban , and 600 jobs were also lost .
