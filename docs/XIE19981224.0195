Shandong Province Hosts More Foreign Tourists
JINAN , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The sharp increase in foreign toursists visiting east China 's Shandong Province during November reversed the stagnant situation during the first ten months of the year .
Shandong hosted 50,534 foreign tourists during November , up 26.3 percent on previous year 's period .
Due to the adverse impacts of the Asian financial crisis , the number of tourists visiting its port cities dropped last year and remained low for several months this year due to the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis .
Shandong has attempted to overcome the impact of the crisis by opening new air routes , including a route from the port city of Qingdao to Tokyo and Fukuoka , as well as a route from Yantai to Seoul .
Local tourism officials attribute the positive change to upgraded port facilities and improved services .
Shandong expects to surpass total number of foreign tourists by the end of December .
