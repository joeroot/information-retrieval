U.S. Confirms 3.8 Percent Economic Growth In 1997
WASHINGTON , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. economy ended 1997 with a 3.9 percent growth rate , below the previously estimated 4.3 percent in the last quarter , but still in robust shape , the Commerce Department said Friday .
However , the latest new estimate of the fourth-quarter in the gross domestic product ( GDP ) was was unchanged from the full year at a nine-year high of 3.8 percent , according to the department .
At the same time inflation fell to the lowest rate in 32 years , 2 percent for all of 1997 and a scant 1.4 percent annual rate during the last half of the year .
Some economists expect Asian financial crisis will bring down U.S. economic growth to about 2.5 percent this year , mainly by expanding the trade deficit .
The latest official estimate of export growth was cut from 11.3 percent to 10 percent .
Import growth was much stronger , 6.4 percent for the quarter versus 1.3 percent .
Other sectors of the economy in the fourth quarter look much the same in Friday 's report as they did in last month 's estimate .
Consumer spending , accounting for about two-thirds of economic activity , grew at 3.1 percent instead of 3.2 percent .
Housing construction increased at 9.7 percent versus 10.4 percent .
Business construction and investment in new equipment declined at 3.5 percent instead of 3.6 percent .
The estimate of growth in government spending was cut from a 1.6 percent rate to 0.4 percent .
The revision was mostly accounted for by the sale of the Elk Hills naval petroleum reserve to private businesses , which offset 800 million dollars in federal spending .
The various changes left the gross domestic product , unadjusted for inflation , at 8.08 trillion dollars for the whole of 1997 .
