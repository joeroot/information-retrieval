EDITORIAL : A WHITE HOUSE LEGAL DODGE

The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday , June 2 :
The latest maneuvering by the White House to avoid accelerated Supreme Court review of its flimsy privilege claims should not deter the justices from grabbing the case .
This is an instance where the court , in its constitutional role , should see the need to intervene in the interest of orderly government and the rule of law .
The nation needs a definitive resolution of the issues that have been raised by the White House to impede the investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr .
In an effort to delay the Supreme Court from entering the fray and to avoid being linked in history with Richard Nixon 's Watergate strategy , President Clinton has dropped his reliance on claims of executive privilege to protect two aides from testifying about issues being probed by Starr .
But he will continue to impede Starr 's investigation into his relationship with Monica Lewinsky by pursuing attorney-client privilege as a reason to challenge , through normal judicial review , some of Starr 's efforts to question Bruce Lindsey , a deputy White House counsel .
In papers filed with the Supreme Court on Monday , White House lawyers argued that Clinton 's use of the attorney-client privilege raised no pressing constitutional issues and therefore did not require the extraordinary step of expedited review .
But a president 's refusal to cooperate with a prosecutor 's reasonable requests for information in a legitimate criminal inquiry is itself a matter of constitutional importance , regardless of the excuses used to justify the stonewalling .
Moreover , Clinton 's remaining claim of attorney-client privilege is really little more than another executive privilege claim in disguise , given that the lawyer he is trying to shield is foremost a political and policy adviser .
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson acknowledged as much when she rejected Clinton 's attorney-client privilege claim regarding Lindsey , applying essentially the same reasoning that she did in turning down the claims of executive privilege .
Although Judge Johnson reached the right conclusions , the Supreme Court could usefully resolve differences between her reasoning and that used by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a year ago in rebuffing a similar White House claim that Hillary Clinton 's conversations with government lawyers about personal Whitewater matters fell under attorney-client privilege .
By taking the case quickly , the court could cut through the barrage of privilege claims that have dragged out the investigation and thus clogged the functioning of the government .
Starr 's brief asking for expedited Supreme Court review called the case `` of high moment , '' and underscored the nation 's interest in having it resolved quickly .
Despite the clever White House legal tactics , it still is .
