TV SPORTS : COSTAS , OUT OF THE STUDIO , IS HAPPY AT COURTSIDE ( JT )
By RICHARD SANDOMIR c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
If Bob Costas pursued NBC 's original plan , he would be completing his eighth season of National Basketball Association play-by-play .
But he chose to be host of the studio show for seven years , deferring to Marv Albert to call games .
Now , Costas is wrapping up his first season of play-by-play in 18 years , and he confesses to preferring calling games to being the studio host .
`` I 'm sorry about the way it happened , '' he said Monday from St. Louis , referring to Albert 's legal woes .
`` But it 's much more fun doing play-by-play .
You feel so much more a part of the league and the games , and it involves more .
It 's more like an orchestra ; there are more elements to take care of . ''
On being hermetically sealed in NBC 's New York studio , Costas said , `` I missed sitting and talking to sports people , to people in the lobby , in the coffee shop , picking up tidbits , being at the shoot-arounds . ''
He added : `` The NBA studio wasn n't the challenge this is .
It was important , but it didn n't have as many variations to it and possibilities of surprise as the games have .
I 'd gotten so used to doing the studio , and I was such a fan of Marv 's , that I never thought of doing games . ''
Costas ' transition from the studio to the game has not been easy .
He had to shake off years of rust _ he last called games regularly for the Bulls on WGN-TV in 1980 _ and tutor the rookie analyst Isiah Thomas .
The late-season hiring of Doug Collins made everyone 's job easier .
And just when Costas was truly getting into a groove , narrating the excitement of the Indiana-Chicago series , a leap by Dennis Rodman onto the broadcasting table nearly turned Costas into a former broadcaster .
`` If he kept going , pile-driving into me , I could have been hurt , but I bounced off him , '' he said .
`` For two seconds , I wondered , ` Am I hurt ? ' I did an inventory of my parts .
Some people thought he did it on purpose , but if he has that much body control , he ought to join Ringling Brothers . ''
Costas ' style is different from Albert 's .
He offers no trademark phrases or exclamations .
The timbre of his voice is different , presenting no staccato accompaniment to the action .
Once Costas was comfortable , he offered a more conventional game call , combined with touches of his humor and the tangible results of his preparation .
His style is to be complete , not idiosyncratic .
Costas usually excels when he sums up a game or an event .
With 8.9 seconds left Sunday in Game 7 of the Indiana-Chicago series , and Chicago up 87 - 83 , he said : `` If the Pacers go here , they have not gone quietly .
It appears the Bulls will survive the Pacers .
But what Michael Jordan termed ` a bump in the road ' was anything but .
It was a mountain to climb , and they barely reached the summit , if in fact they have . ''
Then , he quickly noted the Pacers ' profound shortfall of offensive rebounds as a reason for the loss , but explained that part of the Bulls ' huge lead in the category was due to the Pacers ' good shooting .
That point is often lost in statistic-babble : if you shoot well , you don n't get many offensive rebounds .
What also stood out was Costas ' broadcast-ending comment that credited Indiana for taking the Bulls to the limit .
`` What they did , '' he said , `` was for Mel Daniels and the late Roger Brown , Freddie Lewis , Bob Netolicky and George McGinnis '' _ former Pacers , two of whom played for the American Basketball Association and the NBA _ `` with a brown ball or a red-white-and-blue ball . ''
In post-game interviews Sunday , Jim Gray 's interview with Indiana Coach Larry Bird , and Toni Kukoc 's chat with Costas , Collins and Thomas , both featured questions that focused on the game .
Yet not one of Ahmad `` I Just Spoke to Michael Jordan '' Rashad 's questions to Jordan showed he had watched the game or had taken notes .
When will NBC realize that no matter how close Rashad is to Jordan , he is doing a disservice to viewers by not asking pertinent questions of Jordan ( or anyone else ) in the short time available in the post-game frenzy ?
UECKER 'S NBC FAREWELL : Bob Uecker will not return to call NBC 's baseball schedule _ all postseason except for alternating All-Star Games with Fox _ alongside Costas and Joe Morgan .
He needs surgery on his ailing back .
`` I went to a neurosurgeon , and he told me it 's deterioration from my playing , or my sitting , days , '' he said .
`` It 's not life threatening . ''
Dick Ebersol , the NBC Sports president , said , `` If it 's neurosurgery for Uecker , it 's not life threatening . ''
Ebersol said he tried for three months to persuade Uecker , 63 , to return , but Uecker doubts he will .
He 's content with being the radio voice of the Milwaukee Brewers .
Said Uecker , the sometime actor , `` I 'll just kick back and wait for my Oscar to come in from ` Major League 3. '' '
RATINGS ROOUNDUP : Game 7 of the Bulls-Pacers series generated an enormous 20.8 overnight Nielsen rating , and could become the highest-rated nonfinals game ever .
The Indiana market rated a whopping 50.2 , with Chicago at a 43.8 .
...
Fox 's Detroit-Dallas National Hockey League telecast Sunday produced a 2.5 overnight rating , up from a 1.6 last week , but down from a 3.1 on the comparable Sunday last year .
Still , a 2.5 was Fox 's best hockey rating this season since a 3.1 for the All-Star Game .
...
Fox 's first major-league baseball telecasts of the season _ including the Red Sox-Yankees game Saturday _ chimed in with a national 3.1 rating , up from 3.0 a year ago .
