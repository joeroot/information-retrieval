Business Confidence Drops in New Zealand
WELLINGTON , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Business confidence in New Zealand has dropped sharply as a result of the Asian economic crisis , the Wellington newspaper The Evening Post reported on Friday .
The paper quoted a National Bank survey as saying that nationally , a net 24 percent of companies expect business conditions to worsen , a massive 30-point turnaround from a survey conducted last December , when 6 percent expected things to get better .
It was also 60 points lower than four months ago when the confidence stayed at its peak .
National Bank 's chief economist Brendan O ' Donovan attributed the drastic change to the Asian factor .
He said every sector of the economy surveyed was now more pessimistic about the future .
Among the sectors , services fell 25 points , manufacturing 28 points , retail and construction 29 points each and agriculture 42 points .
One positive finding in the survey was that manufacturers ' exports were holding up well , O ' Donovan said , adding that a net 25-percent increase is expected in exports in the coming year .
