Taihu Lake to be Phosphorus-Pollution Free
NANJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Jiangsu Province in east China has announced a campaign for the next year to clean up phosphorus pollution in Taihu Lake , the third largest fresh-water lake in China .
Complete waste-water treatment plants will be set up around the lake and regulations have been worked out prohibiting the production or consumption of detergents containing phosphoric elements in areas near the lake , according to a seminar held recently in Nanjing , capital of Jiangsu Province .
The phosphoric materials in the lake has been attributed to an over-abundance of algae in the water .
The per capita annual use of phosphoric detergents for local residents in the Taihu Lake valley is 3.5 kilograms , and the yearly consumption of phosphoric detergents in the valley totals about 40,000 tons , producing more than 2,000 tons of phosphorus and accounting for 16 percent of all pollutants discharged into the lake .
Research into and the production of non-phosphoric detergents are in the initial stage in China , and government should encourage the development of this industry , many experts said .
