Kenyan Govt Bails out Cash-Strapped Bank
NAIROBI , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Kenyan government has injected two billion Shillings ( 33.6 million U.S. Dollars ) to save the cash-strapped National Bank of Kenya ( NBK ) , the fourth biggest in the country , from collapse .
The rescue package was announced Saturday by Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae , following panic withdrawals by depositors of 1.6 billion Shillings from the bank in one week , national press reported Sunday .
" To ease pressure on the bank , the government has decided to immediately inject two billion Shillings in honor of its guarantee to the National Bank of Kenya in respect of these parastatal loans " which borrowed money from NBK between 1990 - 1993 , he said .
The NBK has non-performing loans amounting to a whopping three billion Shillings , most of them are due from parastatals , private companies and individuals .
Earlier this year , the government paid 1.5 billion Shillings to the NBK to settle debts owed to the institution by five private companies .
However , the minister said with 23 billion Shillings in assets , NBK was " sound and healthy " and the run was induced by the directors and shareholders of those private banks put under statutory management by the Central Bank of Kenya ( CBK ) in the past two months .
He expressed the determination that the government will do anything possible to re-stabilize the 55-member banking industry in the east African country .
He claimed a plot had been hatched to scare NBK 's depositors by exaggerating the banks liquidity problems as part of a wider scheme to pommel the government to pressurize the CBK to lower the cash ratio and bail out troubled private banks through provision of soft loans .
Meanwhile , he advised fledgling banks to either amalgamate to widen their capital base or transform themselves into financial institutions to do away with demanding responsibilities such as those of trading in the Clearing House .
