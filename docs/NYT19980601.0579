SHE LOVES HER SON , MOTHER TELLS A JURY WEIGHING HIS DEATH
( af ) By JOSEPH P. FRIED c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ Telling jurors who are deciding whether her son should be executed that his fate was really `` in the Lord 's hands , '' the mother of a former jail guard recounted Monday how she fell apart when the police told her that her `` special child '' killed three people .
But despite the bloody 1996 rampage that made her son , Darrel Harris , the first person to be convicted of first-degree murder under New York state 's new capital punishment law , Bertha Harris declared in a Brooklyn courtroom of rapt jurors and spectators , `` My love for my child has not changed . ''
`` I love him and I always will love him , '' the 71-year-old woman said as her son , 40 , stared at her intently from his seat at the defense table in state supreme court .
`` He will always have a special place in my heart , regardless of what happens to him , '' she continued , even as she acknowledged his `` very terrible crime . ''
Ms. Harris did not ask the jury to spare her son 's life _ the panel may sentence him to death or to life in prison without possibility of parole _ saying instead : `` I don n't know what decision you all are making .
That 's not in my hands .
It 's in the Lord 's hands . ''
But her son 's lawyers clearly hope that Ms. Harris ' appearance _ and her portrayal of him as a devoted son who a decade ago made her proud when he was honored for saving the life of a fellow jail guard during an inmate riot _ would help influence the jury to forgo a death sentence .
Deliberations are to begin Tuesday .
In a day of intense emotion , a brother of Harris did ask the jury to spare the convicted man 's life .
`` I don n't really feel that one incident , as great as it is , should determine his life , should put his life on the line , '' the brother , Esau Harris , said .
He was repeating a theme that his brother 's lawyers have sounded throughout the trial : that the jury should consider his entire life , including his heroic act as a jail guard and his lack of a criminal record before the murders he committed during a robbery at an illegal social club in Bedford-Stuyvesant , Brooklyn .
`` I can only ask , dig deep in your hearts and search out the truth and know that one day shouldn n't count for someone 's life , '' said Esau Harris , a senior systems engineer for a banking corporation who is also an ordained minister .
In the hallway outside the courtroom , as a sister of Harris , Shirley Smith , collapsed amid a swirl of television and newspaper cameras , relatives of the people whom Harris murdered reacted emotionally to the testimony by his relatives .
`` I feel for the mother , she got my heart , '' said a crying Detria Davis , the mother of Evelyn Davis , who was 32 when Harris fatally stabbed her at Club Happiness on the morning of Dec. 7 , 1996 .
She said her daughter came to her in a vision Monday morning `` and told me she wasn n't dead , but I know my daughter is dead , '' Ms. Davis , who is in her 50s , continued .
`` And I don n't feel sorry for Harris .
I don n't feel sorry for him at all .
Whatever they give him , he deserves it .
I 'll keep on saying it till I die . ''
Witnesses in the first stage of Harris ' trial , which dealt with the question of guilt or innocence , testified that after shooting three men in the head at close range _ two died and one survived _ and finding himself out of bullets , Harris fatally stabbed Evelyn Davis as she beseeched him to spare her life because `` I have five babies to take care of . ''
Moses Sims , the brother of Jerome Sims , one of the two men Harris killed , told reporters after listening to his relatives : `` Obviously , he came from a very nice family .
But he 's still a killer and he still should get the death penalty .
His family said nice things about him , but I could say nice things about my brother . ''
Jerome Sims , who was 58 , was the manager of Club Happiness and was the first one shot after Harris pulled out a gun and ordered everyone to get on the floor , witnesses testified .
One of the witnesses , Eddie Brown , the man who survived a shot in the head , said Harris had demanded money from the victims and took $ 200 from him .
The third person killed was Michael Harris , 37 ; he was no relation to the convicted man .
One relative of a victim expressed resentment with Harris ' relatives because , she said as she left the courthouse , they were making the victims ' family members `` feel guilty . ''
The testimony by Darrel Harris ' relatives was the last of the trial , and Acting Justice Anne Feldman told the jury of seven women and five men that they would begin deliberating his sentence Tuesday .
