PARIS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Fabrice Tiozzo of France floored Brazilian Ezequiel Paixao in the second round to retain his WBA cruiserweight title in Mont-De-Marsan on Saturday night .
Paixao hit the canvas towards the end of the first round after Tiozzo had connected with a series of punches .
With two minutes of the second round gone , Tiozzo hit Paixao plum on the chin with a right hand for a clear knockout .
Paixao tottered back on to the ropes and fell on to the floor as Tiozzo raised his arms in victory .
The 29-year-old Tiozzo now has a record of 40 wins and one defeat .
Since winning the title on points against American Nate Miller on November 8 last year , he has defended his title twice .
His first was a knockout against American Terry Ray on May 2 after just 57 seconds of the first round .
