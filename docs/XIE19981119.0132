China Offers Giant Market For Overseas Investors
BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- China is projected to push its economy forward at an average annual rate of seven percent in the next ten years and offers a giant market for foreign participation , Sun Zhengyu , vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , said today .
Sun , speaking at the Canada-China Business Council ( CCBC ) 's annual meeting which convened today , said the market exists because China 's planned investment scale for the 1998 - 2000 period exceeds 1.2 trillion U.S. dollars .
" The sources of funds will mainly rely upon domestic savings , but we will also actively utilize foreign funds in a wide range of ways including fund raising for projects , " he said .
He announced that official estimates for the country 's foreign trade volume in the year 2000 will reach 400 billion dollars and that the figure is expected to double by 2010 .
The official expressed his hope that " far-sighted , confident and patient Canadian entrepreneurs will grasp the rare opportunity at the turn of the century " and grow with China .
Sun said that China will increase the import of advanced technology , equipment and materials and provide favorable terms to encourage foreign companies to invest in China .
He said projects that are restricted in the eastern areas have a greater chance of approval in western and central China as local conditions allow , because the resources-rich heartland is in dire need of capital to catch up with eastern regions .
While previously provincial governments could only approve projects with foreign investment of less than 10 million dollars , now they have the authority to approve projects with foreign investment of up to 30 million dollars , he added .
The vice minister expressed his satisfaction with the size and dimension of Sino-Canadian economic cooperation and trade at the two-day conference .
He said that by the end of October China has approved nearly 3,900 Canadian direct investment projects , attracting contractual funds of over six billion dollars , adding that more than 1.6 billion dollars have already been invested in China .
Canadian companies are now involved in agriculture , forestry , transport , telecommunications , electricity , energy , the metallurgical industry , medical care and finance in China .
While Chinese officials try to lure Canadian investment , Sergio Marchi , Canadian minister for international trade , said in his speech that Canada must also attract more Chinese investment in Canada .
He told representatives of over 250 member companies of the CCBC to speak to Chinese businessmen about " the advantages of the Canadian economy and make them aware that Canada could be a choice location for Chinese international investment . "
" Many business leaders in China still see Canada as we were 20 years ago : a resource-based economy , " he said , " But things have changed .
Twenty years ago , 60 percent of our exports were commodity-based .
Today , it 's only about 35 percent -- that 's just 12 percent of our GDP . "
" In fact , when Chinese business leaders think of Canada , they should be thinking high tech , " he said .
" They should be thinking of a knowledge-based economy , fired by information technology , fueled by telecommunications and fortified by the fifth largest aerospace industry in the world . "
The CCBC is a private sector , non-profit membership organization incorporated in 1978 to facilitate and promote trade and investment between Canada and China .
