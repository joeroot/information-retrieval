CLINTON TO ENTER CENSUS FRAY OVER NEW COUNTING PLAN
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By NANCY MATHIS c.1998 Houston Chronicle
WASHINGTON _ The nation 's census for 2000 already has politicians playing the numbers game and the stakes are enormous .
President Clinton enters the debate Tuesday in Houston on the side of the Census Bureau and Democrats who want a new counting method they claim will better tally minorities and poor people left out of the 1990 census .
But Republicans , who claim the new method is unconstitutional , hope to put the issue before the Supreme Court this fall .
At stake are billions of dollars in public and private funds .
`` This is by far going to be the most controversial census ever , '' said a Republican staff member involved in the battle .
The last major census controversy was in 1920 when the population count revealed more Americans living in cities than the country for the first time .
Rural lawmakers refused to procede with the reapportionment that would have cost them control of Congress .
Clinton will appear Tuesday at the Magnolia Multi-Service Center near downtown Houston to hold a round-table discussion with business executives , minority leaders and academics to talk about the impact of the 2000 census and the need for an accurate count .
It will mark the first time Clinton has entered the census fray .
At issue is the Census Bureau plan , developed by the National Academy of Sciences , to use a statistical sampling , rather than an actual hard count , of 10 percent of the population to project the number of people who fail to respond either by mail or to personal contact .
Republican Party officials fear statistical sampling , which would add more low-income people who traditionally vote Democratic , could cost them as many as 24 House seats and 400 seats in state legislatures .
The White House denies politics is a motivating factor .
`` This is the first census of the information age .
It makes sense to use the most modern technology to ensure that we get the most accurate information , '' said spokeswoman Ann Lewis .
`` Our goal is the most accurate census using the most up-to-date scientific methods and the best technology with the most cost-effective use of taxpayer dollars , '' Lewis said .
Houston was chosen as the venue for Clinton 's first remarks on the topic , Lewis said , because the city had a big undercount of Hispanics .
Officials estimate 66,748 people , most of them Hispanics and children , were left uncounted in Houston .
They estimate 482,738 people , half of them children , were uncounted for the state of Texas , one of the largest disparities in the nation .
Texas officials estimate the 1990 undercount cost the state $ 1 billion in federal funds .
`` There 's no question that the newest Americans , the ones we most need to learn about , are the hardest ones to find , '' said Stephen Klineberg , professor of sociology at Rice University and director of the annual Houston Area Survey .
He will be on the panel discussing the issue with the president .
`` They 're the hardest to convince that it 's safe to fill out the census .
They 're the hardest to reach in terms of language and in terms of mobility because they 've just arrived and they don n't have a permanent residence , '' he said .
There is general agreement that the 1990 census left out a significant number of people , but no one knows how many .
`` Accuracy is critically important because America is in the process of rapid social change and rapid demographic change and only the census gives a meaningful picture of what 's actually happening , '' Klineberg said .
But Rep. Dan Miller , R-Fla . , chairman of the House subcommittee on the census , disputed the accuracy of the sampling system and suggested that politics was the driving force .
`` The partisan calculations of political science are driving the Clinton administration census sampling scheme , '' Miller said .
`` Rather than committing himself to do the hard work necessary to end the minority undercount , the president is out peddling statistical snake oil to the public that will add millions of ` virtual people ' in some areas while subtracting millions of real people from other areas , '' Miller said .
Robert Shapiro , the Commerce Department 's undersecretary for economic affairs , said no American will be subtracted from the count and that the sampling method was developed by statisticians , not politicians .
`` The real stake is how well is America governed , '' Shapiro said .
`` The census data is used in the allocation of $ 180 billion in federal funds every year .
Census data is used for the planning and evaluation of scores of very important federal programs .
It 's used to make decisions about where to site hospitals , where to build schools , where to build sewers . ''
Rep. Gene Green , D-Texas , said he is baffled by the Republican reaction to the census plan .
He said the people who weren n't counted already live in congressional districts and already are registered to vote .
The main issue , he said , was one of financial fairness to growing states such as Texas .
A Republican staff member maintained if the bureau had used statistical sampling in 1990 it would have mistakenly given an additional House seat to Arizona and taken one away from Pennsylvania .
A sampling the bureau conducted after the last enumeration contained many errors that officials repeatedly adjusted .
Critics also point to a General Accounting Office report released in March .
The report concluded that the bureau remains confident about its ability but the GAO officials expressed concern `` that important questions remain unanswered . ''
House Republicans maintain the Census Bureau could continue its old enumeration plan but update its address lists and coordinate with other agencies such as Medicaid .
The `` actual enumeration '' is required by the Constitution , they argue in their lawsuit .
Houston and other cities have contested the GOP court action , which will go directly to the Supreme Court once the district court makes its ruling .
But Klineberg noted the first enumerators in 1790 left out a critical element of the population _ American Indians _ a difficulty akin to surveying today 's reluctant immigrants .
`` I thought the idea of a census was accuracy and it turns out it 's politics , '' Klineberg said .
