FROM BRONX GARBAGE HEAP TO GOLF COURSE
( ATTN . : Fla. ) ( ja ) By DOUGLAS MARTIN c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ A bedraggled Bronx garbage heap _ heretofore a place for dumping stolen cars and , at least once , a human body _ will become a $ 22-million city-owned golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus , city officials said Tuesday .
The course , the first new one in the city in 35 years , is planned for an undeveloped section of Ferry Point Park , in the shadow of the Whitestone Bridge .
Despite its municipal ownership and landfill locale , it will aim for a measure of exclusivity .
The developers _ led by Nicklaus , one the sport 's most revered figures _ say the course and its amenities will be of country-club caliber .
The number of golfers will be strictly limited , and the price will be almost twice the cost of a round on the other city-owned courses .
The plan , scheduled to be formally announced today by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , could be a boon for the growing number of golfers in the city and the region .
With the sport 's popularity rising , playing on one of the city 's existing public courses can often be an ordeal , with tough competition for a tee time and near-gridlock on the fairways .
`` We 'll do something special for the Big Apple , '' Nicklaus said in a telephone interview Monday .
He has created a preliminary layout for the course based on pictures and maps of the site , but will see the location in person for the first time Tuesday .
Nicklaus , whose company has designed 152 courses , said he did not want to make the Ferry Point course too complicated .
`` I hope we don n't make it too hard , '' he said .
The development , which is scheduled to be completed in 2001 , also includes plans for a white-tablecloth restaurant , a marina and an esplanade .
The construction cost will be completely financed by the developers , who , in turn , will receive a 35-year lease .
In an escalating formula , the city would get at least $ 1.25 million a year beginning in 2001 , rising to $ 3 million in the last five years of the lease .
The plan , the largest license deal ever signed by the Parks Department , requires approval from the city 's Art Commission , which reviews all design work for public property .
The expected price to play 18 holes will be nearly $ 40 on weekends for city residents , almost double the $ 20.50 at other city courses .
But J. Pierre Gagne , a golf-course developer and one of Nicklaus ' partners , said that would be a bargain given the quality of the course .
He noted that many new courses open to the public charged $ 65 or more while country club memberships ranged from $ 30,000 to $ 150 , 000 .
`` This is quite an opportunity , '' he said .
`` It 's a tremendous asset to the city of New York . ''
The ball fields and picnic area in the western portion of Ferry Point Park will not be affected by the golf course , which will cover the marshy , weedy eastern part of the 414-acre expanse .
Over the years , city officials have proposed all manner of developments for the site , from a new Yankee Stadium to a football stadium to housing .
The administration of Mayor Abraham Beame first suggested a golf course in 1976 .
The site is near the interchange of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Cross-Bronx and Bruckner Expressways , though there is no subway line nearby .
There appears to be little local opposition to the plan , with widespread sentiment that anything is better than a neglected landfill .
`` People in the neighborhood are longing to see this garbage dump become a nice thing , '' said Dart Westphal , president of the Bronx Council of Environmental Quality , an advocacy group .
Some advocates for green space , however , are upset about increasing concessions in parks , which they fear are leading to rampant privatization .
`` There are already plenty of golf courses on public land , '' said David Lutz , program director of the Neighborhood Open Spaces Coalition .
`` At the same time , there are many things the city lacks on public land , '' he added , suggesting a campground and nature educational centers .
Four bids were received for the site , with the runner-up group including Arnold Palmer as a partner and designer , parks officials said .
The site was advertised twice in the last decade in golf business magazines , but there were no serious bids .
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said the interest this time around was a result of a booming local and national economy and a ballooning interest in golf _ as well as a new spirit in the city .
The number of rounds played on the city courses increased to 885,497 last year from 580,588 in 1982 .
The city 's courses , all run by concessionaires , had gross receipts of $ 22 million last year , $ 2.6 million of which went to the city .
The growing popularity of golf is already evident in the city .
The pitch-and-putt course at Flushing Meadows Corona Park is having night lighting installed and is expanding to include mini-golf .
The Randalls Island driving range 's capacity is being doubled to 180 stalls .
Under a program to instruct youth , the Professional Golfers Association is renovating Mosholu Golf Course in the Bronx .
The concessionaire at the Forest Park course in Queens just spent more than $ 1 million in improvements .
Under the Ferry Point deal , the participants _ Nicklaus ' Golden Bear International , based in North Palm Beach , Fla. ; Gagne Development , of White Plains , N.Y . , and the Flag Financial Corp. , of New York City _ will spend $ 22 million to build the course , a driving range , a clubhouse , the marina and restaurant and a catering facility .
They will also build the waterfront promenade , pedestrian and bicycle paths , picnic areas and restrooms , and will make improvements to an adjacent playground .
Flag , the financing arm , is putting up 65 percent of the investment .
The other partners are evenly splitting the rest .
After the 35-year lease expires , the city can negotiate a deal with anyone or run the course itself .
The construction cost is significantly higher than the norm for a course , Gagne said , in part because of the difficulty of building on a landfill .
This means the sub-surface materials must be minutely analyzed before development can begin .
Nicklaus , citing his experience in building a course on top of a toxic dump site in Montana , said soil would have to be brought in .
`` It 's a golf course that will be built on top and not cut in , '' he said .
The architect for the clubhouse and other buildings is Butler Rogers Baskett of New York .
