Thai Military Officers Encouraged to Retire Early
BANGKOK , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Some Thai military officers will be encouraged to retire starting from June next year as part of the Defense Ministry 's cost-cutting measures , source from the ministry said Monday .
The officers will include those holding ranks of special colonel , special group captain and senior captain for at least three years , the source said .
Incentives , including promotion to the ranks of major , air vice marshal and rear admiral and a one-year income tax exemption , will be given to colonels who voluntarily quit the military service .
The move is another step the Defense Ministry takes to improve work efficiency and reduce costs .
The ministry 's restructuring committee has agreed to reduce the number of generals of all armed forces , and only 75 percent of the generals who retire next year will be replaced .
It has also lengthened the duration of the promotion of military officers in which the promotion of a sub-lieutenant to the rank of special colonel will take at least 23 years .
It is said that the proposed military restructuring plan , which put the supreme commander and the three armed forces chiefs under the permanent secretary for defense , has been rejected by military top brass .
The armed forces has reportedly favored the proposed joint chiefs-of-staff system .
Under the proposal , the supreme commander , not the permanent secretary , will oversee the joint chiefs-of-staff committee with the chiefs of the three armed forces serving as committee members .
