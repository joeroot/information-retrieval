HIGH COURT OPENS DOOR TO SUITS AGAINST FEC
( ATTN : Ill. ) ( mk ) By LINDA GREENHOUSE c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Monday opened the door to lawsuits against the Federal Election Commission by voters claiming that the commission has not adequately enforced the disclosure requirements imposed by federal law on certain political groups .
The 6 - 3 decision , recognizing what the court referred to as `` voter standing , '' was surprising for a court that has often appeared to go out of its way to shield federal agencies from having to defend their administrative actions in court .
The Clinton administration had argued on behalf of the FEC that lawsuits of this type expressed no more than `` generalized grievances , '' shared by the populace at large , and were not sufficiently particular or concrete to come within the jurisdiction of the federal courts .
The decision was , however , little more than a pyrrhic victory for the plaintiffs in the case , six former politicians and diplomats who oppose U.S. support for Israel and were trying to force the FEC to require a leading pro-Israel lobbying group to disclose membership and financial information .
While ruling that the six men were entitled to bring their lawsuit , the court sent the merits of the nine-year-old dispute back to the election commission under circumstances that make it highly likely that the organization , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , will never have to make the disclosures the plaintiffs have been seeking .
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion , which was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens , Anthony Kennedy , David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Sandra Day O ' Connor and Clarence Thomas .
The case presented the substantive question _ of interest to a broad array of grass-roots lobbying organizations _ of the definition of a `` political committee '' under the FEC Act of 1971 .
Under the law , political committees must comply with extensive record-keeping and disclosure rules , which include listing any donor who gives the group more than $ 200 in a year as well as disclosing the amount and purpose of expenditures .
The law defines a political committee as `` any committee '' that receives or spends more than $ 1,000 in a given year for the purpose of `` influencing any election for federal office . ''
The six plaintiffs in this case sought in 1989 to have the FEC apply this definition to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , known as AIPAC , and to require disclosure of its members and expenditures .
AIPAC , a nonprofit membership organization that does not endorse candidates or make direct political contributions , argued that it was not a political committee within the meaning of the law .
Because its spending was for communication to its own dues-paying membership of 50,000 on political subjects of mutual interest , AIPAC said , it did not meet the $ 1,000 threshold to be counted as a political committee .
The FEC did not agree , but it decided not to make AIPAC subject to the disclosure requirements in any event .
If an organization did not have as its `` major purpose '' the nomination or election of candidates , the commission said , it would not be considered a political committee even if it came within the law 's technical definition .
On appeal , the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled last year that there was no basis in the law for the `` major purpose '' test and that the commission would have to treat AIPAC as a political committee .

In its Supreme Court appeal , FEC vs. Akins , No. 96 - 1590 , the commission argued vigorously that the six plaintiffs never had standing to bring their suit in the first place .
The government argued that a policy dispute with the commission did not sufficiently distinguish these plaintiffs from others with generalized grievances or give them the concrete , personal stake in the litigation required by Article III of the Constitution , which limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to `` cases or controversies . ''
One of the plaintiffs was Paul Findley , a former Republican member of Congress from Illinois who has blamed AIPAC for his re-election defeat in 1982 and has publicly referred to the federal government as `` Israeli-occupied territory . ''
Another , James Akins , is a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia .
All are highly critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East .
In his opinion for the court Monday , Breyer offered a two-part analysis for why the plaintiffs , and other voters in future cases , were entitled to bring the election commission into court .
First , he said , the wording of the 1971 law , which authorizes `` any party aggrieved by an order of the commission dismissing a complaint '' to file suit in U.S. District Court , indicated that Congress intended to permit suits of this kind , particularly when the suit requested information of the kind that the law requires to be disclosed .
And further , Breyer said , the lawsuit met constitutional requirements by asserting a `` genuine injury in fact '' _ the plaintiffs ' inability to obtain information that , if they are correct about the law , they have a right to obtain .
`` The informational injury at issue here , '' Breyer said , `` directly related to voting , the most basic of political rights , is sufficiently concrete and specific such that the fact that it is widely shared does not deprive Congress of constitutional power to authorize its vindication in the federal courts . ''
However , he continued , the court should not address the validity of the disputed definition of a political committee because the commission was currently considering a new rule that could make the question irrelevant to AIPAC 's status .
The commission 's proposal would take a broader view of the type of `` membership organization '' that AIPAC has always claimed to be , a change that would in turn be likely to treat AIPAC 's expenditures as `` membership communications '' rather than the kind of spending that would bring it within the definition of a political committee .
In that eventuality , Breyer said , the campaign law would not apply and the dispute over the commission 's `` major purpose '' test would be moot .
AIPAC was not a party in the case before the court , but filed a friend of the court brief suggesting the course the court took Monday .
A lawyer for the group , Thomas Hungar , said Monday that the court `` did exactly what we asked '' and that AIPAC would `` clearly qualify '' as a membership organization under the commission 's proposed new approach .
In his dissenting opinion , Scalia said the court had expanded the concept of standing `` beyond what the Constitution permits '' and that consequently the court should have interpreted the 1971 law more narrowly so as not to allow the lawsuit .
`` A system in which the citizenry at large could sue to compel executive compliance with the law would be a system in which the courts , rather than of the president , are given the primary responsibility to ` take care that the laws be faithfully executed , ' '' Scalia said .
One of the plaintiffs , Andrew Killgore , said his group would continue to press for AIPAC to be defined as a political committee and expected to prevail in forcing disclosure of AIPAC 's activities .
`` In the clear light of day , AIPAC 's activities will cease to be those of an 800-pound gorilla on Capitol Hill when it comes to U.S. policies in the Middle East , '' he said .
In a second case Monday , the court agreed to hear a government appeal in one of the country 's longest-running immigration cases , the effort to deport a group of seven Palestinians and a Kenyan for their activities in support of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine .
The government has lost most of the numerous legal battles in the 11-year-old case .
Most recently , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , in San Francisco , ruled last July that a preliminary injunction against deportation should be kept in effect to enable the eight to collect further evidence to support their claim that they are victims of selective prosecution based on constitutionally protected advocacy of an unpopular political viewpoint .
While the government regards the Popular Front as a terrorist group , the eight have been involved in fund-raising and have not been charged with any acts of violence .
Federal immigration law has changed several times during the course of the case .
The government is now arguing that the most recent change , the 1996 enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act , retroactively stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction over the case and should be applied to lift the injunction .
The government argues that the new law left the courts with jurisdiction to review only a final order of deportation , which has not yet been issued .
In its order Monday granting review of the case , Reno vs. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee , No. 97 - 1252 , the justices narrowed the question to an intepretation of the jurisdictional provisions of the new law .
However , because the lower courts have found that the Palestinians ' First Amendment rights are at stake , the justices may have to address the question of whether Congress can close the courthouse door to constitutional challenges to immigration decisions .
