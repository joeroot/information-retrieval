PATRIOTS TEAM TO BEAT IN AFC EAST , HEAD COACHES SAY
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By WILL MCDONOUGH c.1998 The Boston Globe
Pete Carroll wanted to know if he was doing any better with his peers in the AFC East than he has been doing with the national media in preseason polls .
`` Those guys didn n't pick us last , did they ? ''
asked Carroll with a chuckle .
No , Pete , they didn n't .
In fact , the four head coaches who compete against you in division all think you have the team to beat .
Says Jim Mora , Indianapolis Colts : `` The Patriots have the most talented team in the division .
A lot of weapons , and they should be a strong playoff team . ''
Says Jimmy Johnson , Miami Dolphins : `` No question they have the best talent in the division .
But if somthing happens to ( Drew ) Bledsoe , that will change in a hurry .
Then I think we could leapfrog ' em .
With Curtis Martin also out of there , they wouldn n't have anything to hang their hat on . ''
Says Wade Phillips , Buffalo Bills : `` The Patriots are the team to beat .
They are very strong defensively .
I think their quarterback might be looking at a breakthrough year where he takes it to the next level .
It will be interesting to see how they run the ball without Martin . ''
Says Bill Parcells , New York Jets : `` New England has the best overall talent .
A good blend of veterans and younger players .
They are more battle hardened than the other teams in the division .
They 've played in bigger games . ''
& QL ; -- -- & QC ; & QL ;
Johnson , on the Dolphins : `` This will be the best team I 've had since I started coaching here .
The talent is better .
The overall speed is better .
I feel good about every position .
That 's not to say we have a bunch of superstars , but we can put a solid player at every spot .
We are going to run the ball better .
We 've changed our running game .
We had to .
We stopped scoring points in the middle of last season , because we couldn n't run the ball .
Then teams started to blitz us and then by the end of the season they were blitzing us on every down .
If we run the ball with success Dan ( Marino ) is going to be fine .
Defensively , we 'll be pretty good .
We drafted some young players I like that will help us .
We had another good draft .
What worries me most is injury .
I never talked about injuries in my entire coaching career until last year , and then we had so many , I started to become paranoid .
I was starting every sentence with , ` if we can stay healthy . ' But if we stay healthy ...
'' says Johnson with a big laugh , not finishing the sentence .
& QL ; -- -- & QC ; & QL ;
Phillips , on the Bills : `` We 've got a young team , with a lot of new players , and they will have to come through for us if we want to get better .
We have to get better .
Last year we led in fumbles , interceptions , and had the worst passing stats in the league , including last on third-down conversions .
Our main concern will be scoring points .
Our quarterback situation will be better with Rob Johnson ( from Jacksonville ) .
We 're committed to him ( as the starter ) .
We like what we have seen so far .
Doug Flutie is the kind of guy that can give you a spark .
We think Todd Collins can play better .
Our running game will be key .
Our offensive line has to play better than it has .
Sam Gash will be our fullback .
We need ( wide receiver ) Eric Moulds to come through for us .
He 's lost some weight ( 12 pounds ) and looks great .
Our defense will be good .
We are going to switch to a 4 - 3 for the first time since I 've been here because we have a bunch of good defensive linemen , and we 've lost some linebackers .
The most important thing for us will be to run the ball .
When you can n't run , teams just kill you with those zone-dogs .
If you can run , then you can hurt them with the running game . ''
& QL ; -- -- & QC ; & QL ;
Carroll , on the Patriots : `` We 've got some strong things going for us .
Our defense is young and spunky .
We 've got a question at cornerback , and if we get that fixed we should be very good .
Our defense should be better just on the strength of having played together for another system , and knowing the system better .
Offensively , we know we can throw the ball .
We have to find out if we can run the ball , and who the guy carrying it is going to be .
That 's what we will find out in training camp . ''
& QL ; -- -- - & QC ; & QL ;
Mora , in his first season with the Colts : `` The whole key is Peyton ( Manning ) .
We think he is going to be a special player .
Now we have to put the people around him who can help him perform .
I think we have some weapons on offense .
We 've got the runner ( Marshall ) Faulk .
We 've got the wide receiver ( Marvin ) Harrison .
We 've got two fine tight ends , ( Ken ) Dilger and ( Marcus ) Pollard .
And our offensive line is better than some critics think .
We will play a lot of two back , and some double tight end .
We have to do the best job of protecting Peyton that we can .
We can n't let the other teams just tee off on him .
We have to get him in situations ( third and short ) where he has a chance to be successful .
Our defense wasn n't very good last year .
It 's going to take us time to get that reversed .
We gave up too many big plays , and too many easy touchdowns .
We 're going to play better team defense .
We have to make the other team work to score .
''
& QL ; -- -- & QC ; & QL ;
Parcells , on the Jets : `` We should be a better team than we were a year ago .
I think we 've improved our offensive line , and by doing that our running game .
We should have more firepower on offense .
Quarterback will be the question .
We have to see what happens there .
Curtis ( Martin ) should give us a better running game , and I feel my backs will catch the ball better than our backs did last season .
Defensively , we did not give up a lot of points last year , but we are not overpowering , either .
We 'll have good special teams .
I think that will be our strength . ''
& QL ; -- -- & QC ; & QL ;
Division outlook :
Johnson : `` New England is the team to beat .
They have the most talent .
Their defense is very good .
They are going to be tough to beat , not question .
Buffalo will try to run the ball on offense .
Their defense is a little older , and hopefully not as dominant as in the past .
Everyone says Johnson is the answer at quarterback .
We 'll see .
I rate the Jets behind New England .
They 'll have a better running game with Martin . ''
Phillips : `` We 've got three teams in the division in the same situation , all with new quarterbacks .
Johnson here .
( Glenn ) Foley in New York .
Peyton with the Colts .
All three teams want to build a better running game to help those young quarterbacks out .
All three will need some time for the quarterbacks to fit .
New England is solid .
I like them a lot on defense .
Marino is still the big factor in Miami . ''
Mora : `` The Patriots have the best overall talent .
I think they really helped themselves in the draft with all of those picks .
I 've got a great deal of respect for Jimmy ( Johnson ) and the job his staff does .
That team doesn n't seem to have a great deal of talent , but he got them to the playoffs .
The Jets are hard to evaluate because of their quarterback situation .
Foley is the key .
Same in Buffalo with Johnson .
How well those guys plays will determine how well their teams do . ''
Carroll : `` I count on the Jets being stronger .
They made great strides last year , and should get better just from the continuity of the system .
They 've got a heck of a running back and the acquistions of Vinny ( Testaverde ) should really help them .
When he gets to know the system they 'll have a good 1 - 2 punch with him and Foley .
Miami , Buffalo , and Indianapolis will all emphasize the run .
They 've got new coaching staffs and the coaches calling the shots believe in the running game . ''
Parcells : `` New England has the best situation at quarterback .
The rest of us are unsettled at that position , including Miami .
They don n't know for sure how Marino is going to hold up .
And the rest of us will be playing with new starting quarterbacks .
The Colts will be better than people think .
They weren n't that bad at the end of last season when they beat us pretty good .
Buffalo is high on Johnson .
I 've heard some good things about that kid .
So he could make them tougher . ''
& QL ; -- -- & QC ; & QL ;
Overview from Phillips : `` This is a tough division because every team in it is committed to winning .
When the Jets go get Parcells , and Miami gets Johnson , you know they are going all out .
Indy brings in Bill Polian and Jim Mora , two guys who have had great success in winning .
We 're trying to change things here .
It 's going to be very competitive . ''
