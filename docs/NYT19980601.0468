GOVERNING COALITION VICTORIOUS IN MONTENEGRIN ELECTIONS

BELGRADE , Yugoslavia _ President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro celebrated his governing coalition 's sweeping victory in crucial parliamentary elections on Monday , ensuring his domination of a government that will defy integration with Serbia .
The victory is considered certain to widen the schism between Djukanovic and the government in Belgrade led by President Slobodan Milosevic .
The elections for the 78-seat parliament were seen by many as a referendum on whether Montenegro , which with Serbia makes up the present Yugoslavia , should stay in the Yugoslav federation .
The defeat of Momir Bulatovic 's Socialist People 's Party , financed and backed by Milosevic , means that Belgrade will now have to use other means , perhaps a state of emergency , to keep Montenegro from drifting toward secession , Western diplomats said .
With 94 percent of the vote in Sunday 's elections counted , the Montenegrin Election Commission said the coalition led by Djukanovic had taken 49.5 percent of the vote .
Bulatovic 's Socialists won 36.07 percent , and the Liberal Alliance , which openly calls for secession , won 6 percent , with the balance split between smaller parties .
The governing coalition is expected to get about 40 seats in Parliament , with about 30 for Bulatovic 's Socialists .
Djukanovic is also expected to receive support from the Liberals and ethnic Albanian legislators to give him an unassailable majority .
`` Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom , courage and resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro , '' Djukanovic , 36 , told cheering supporters outside Government House , adding :
`` This is not our final victory .
Our final victory will be when democracy wins throughout Yugoslavia . ''
There was no sign that Milosevic was preparing to orchestrate the street protests and rioting that took place in Podgorica , the Montenegrin capital , after the inauguration in January of Djukanovic as president .
Djukanovic narrowly defeated Bulatovic in the presidential vote held last fall , driving him from office .
Bulatovic , however , said on Monday that his party was not satisfied with the `` mechanisms of electoral control . ''
The state-run news media in Belgrade have repeatedly warned that Djukanovic 's coalition was planning to commit fraud and darkly hinted that such vote rigging would be resisted .
Western diplomats said the battle between Djukanovic and Milosevic , who is currently preoccupied with trying to stamp out a separatist rebellion by ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo , was far from over .
They said tactics like Belgrade 's decision not to pay pensions to those living in Montenegro , a refusal to include Djukanovic in the federal government and the sealing of the borders with neighboring Croatia to thwart trade , would continue and perhaps be stepped up .

Bulatovic , in a move that Montenegrin lawmakers dismissed as illegal , was chosen by Milosevic last month to be the federal prime minister .
He is expected to use his office to continue to stymie efforts by Djukanovic to sever links with Belgrade and attract badly needed foreign investment .
The Serbian and Montenegrin Parliaments send an equal number of legislators to the upper house of the federal Parliament , although Montenegro has only 650,000 people to Serbia 's 10.5 million .
Djukanovic will now be able to appoint the deputies from Montenegro , further complicating Milosevic 's hold on power .
Milosevic 's governing Socialists , however , have a substantial majority in the lower house .
The two federal bodies elected and can remove Milosevic from his post as president .
`` This conflict isn n't over , '' a European diplomat said .
`` It may have just begun . ''
