Scientists Stress Development of Aquiculture ( 1 )
JINAN , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Zeng Chengkui , an outstanding academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences , said recently that resolving the issue of grain in China will rely on the full use of marine resources and the development of what he termed " blue agriculture " .
Zeng , a famous oceanologist , explained that blue agriculture can also be referred to marine agriculture , or the development and processing of aquatic products and marine husbandry .
He predicted that China 's maritime breeding industry will have the capability of producing 40 million tons annually in 20 - 30 years if developed properly , or twice the current annual quota for imported grain .
" Who Will Feed China " , a book written by American author Lester Brown and issued in 1995 , points out that the nation currently imports some 20 million tons of grain annually .
However , according to Brown , the volume required when China 's population hits 1.6 billion by the year 2030 has not as yet been determined .
Brown says in the book that no country in the world will have enough extra grain to feed China .
The American scholar 's view not only sparked strong repercussions in China 's political and academic circles , but also attracted worldwide attention concerning the safety of China 's grain problem .
" This is indeed a real problem for China , " said Zeng , adding that grain is an international issue and oceanologists should table their views on the use of marine organisms .
