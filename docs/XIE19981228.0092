Zambians Urged to Cherish Concept of Extended
LUSAKA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- The Zambians have been urged to cherish the traditional concept of extended family and take responsibility to look after the orphans and the old , Zambia Daily Mail reported Monday .
The Zambians should not abandon the extended family concept just because of the existence of orphanages and old people 's homes , Jane Chikwata , deputy minister of Community Development and Social Welfare , said over the weekend at an old people 's home in Livingstone , the country 's tourism capital on the southern border .
The traditional family system in Zambia , where there are about 400,000 orphans , is facing dissolution with the society 's gradual westernization .
The deputy minister urged the Zambians to be mindful of their traditional responsibilities while embracing the western concept of orphanages .
Chikwata also appealed to the citizens to get back to the African extended family system , saying effects of poverty and diseases like AIDS and HIV should not be used as an excuse for the rising number of social institutions in a small country like Zambia .
" Social institutions like orphanages , homes for the blind and homes for the aged are foreign concepts .
The Zambians have villages and extended families , " she said .
The official described the abandoning of relatives as a " shameful " conduct , saying those irresponsible for their relatives needed counseling to help them refrain from such conduct .
