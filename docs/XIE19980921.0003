Zambians Urged not to Import Goods Available
LUSAKA , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- The Zambian government Sunday urged companies not to abuse foreign exchange by importing goods available in the country .
Commerce , Trade and Industry Minister Enock Kavindele warned that the government may be forced to regulate imports if the firms continue to import the goods available in Zambia .
He noted that foreign exchange is being misused by importing the commodities such as bananas , carrots and tomatoes , which are available in the country .
We do understand that Zambia 's economy is liberalized but traders must make right decisions and also exercise self restraint .
Because of reduced foreign exchange inflow , falling international copper prices , slowing privatization process of its copper mines and heavy burden of foreign debts , Zambia 's currency Kwacha has devalued drastically with 2,000 against one U.S. Dollar compared with 1,400 against one Dollar early this year .
Zambia is very dependent on imports , the depreciation of Kwacha has pushed up the prices of imported commodities , and reduced the purchasing power of Zambians .
Foreign reserves of Zambia had dropped to 155 million Dollars by last July from 227 million Dollars at the end of last year as a result .
