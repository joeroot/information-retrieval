Clinton Endorses Shield for Internet Taxes
LOS ANGELES , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday said Thursday in San Francisco that the Internet should be shielded from any tax , at least for five years .
He called for the passage of the Internet Tax Act , which would put up to a five-year moratorium on new local , state or federal taxes on electronic commerce and the Internet .
" There should be no special rates for the Internet , but we can n't allow unfair taxation to weigh it down and stunt the development of the most promising new economic opportunity in decades , " Clinton told a high-tech conference .
Some U.S. governors expressed their concern that untaxed sales over the Internet will drain money from their budgets as consumers shift purchases away from stores .
Clinton said that during the moratorium , a bipartisan commission would work with states to help devise a tax strategy for dealing in the future with online transactions , which will not drain money from states while allowing " the Internet to flourish . "
