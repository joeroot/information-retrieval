Rival Parties in Cambodia Declare Truce
PHNOM PENH , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Cambodian government on Friday ordered its troops to implement a truce throughout the country , hours after rival forces loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh announced a ceasefire .
" To end the suffering of the Cambodian people and to prepare for the upcoming general election in July 1998 , from midnight today , February 27 , 1998 , I call on the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces ( RCAF ) loyal to me to declare a unilateral ceasefire over Cambodia , " Ranariddh said in a statement released Friday .
The prince , however , said that the RCAF fully reserved the right of self-defense if attacked by government forces .
" I also proposed the creation of a bipartisan , ad-hoc committee to monitor the truce , with the assistance of international observers , " Ranariddh added .
The prince ordered the truce after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen promised on Thursday that the government would declare a ceasefire if its rivals did it first .
Hun Sen made the promise in response to a proposal from the Japanese government last week to solve the conflict between Hun Sen 's forces and those of his ousted co-premier Prince Ranariddh .
Tokyo suggested that the ousted first prime minister cut off any military cooperation with the Khmer Rouge and announce a ceasefire immediately .
In return , the government would guarantee the prince 's " safety and security " and allow him to take part in the general election scheduled for July 26 .
Shortly after Prince Ranariddh announced a truce on Friday , Ke Kim Yan , chief of the RCAF General Staff , ordered the government forces to observe a ceasefire throughout Cambodia .
