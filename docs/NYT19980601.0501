DATA GENERAL LAYS OFF 400 WORKERS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By HIAWATHA BRAY c.1998 The Boston Globe
The price wars that staggered the computer industry took another swipe at Data General Corp. The company Monday laid off 400 workers _ 150 in Massachusetts _ and said it would take a $ 125 million charge as it abandons the manufacturing of low-end server computers .
`` The prices have dropped so fast , '' said Data General 's chief executive , Ronald Skates , adding , `` we 're just not going to be in a position to design these products for ourselves . ''
Instead , Skates said , Westborough-based Data General will focus solely on producing high-end server and data storage systems , which bring in fatter profit margins than do low-end models .
Since 1989 , Data General , once among the hardware industry 's hottest companies , has slashed its work force from 18,000 to 5,100 as the industry has shifted to meet the rising popularity of personal computers .
Until recently , there was reason to believe that the bloodletting at Data General was over and a turnaround had begun .
Prior to last quarter , it had reported 10 straight quarterly profits , and booming sales of servers and data storage systems .
But recently , prices for low-end servers have softened .
Servers are used to store or transfer information among PCs in a network .
`` What we 've seen in the last six to nine months is a lot of pricing pressure , because demand has certainly fallen off , '' said Peter Lieu , an industry analyst at Adams Harkness & AMP ; Hill Inc. in Boston .
Lieu said that Dell Computer Corp. is one of the few firms able to grow market share and revenues , further squeezing weaker players like Data General .
Skates said that Data General will continue to offer a full range of Aviion servers running the Unix and Microsoft Windows NT operating systems .
But lower-cost Aviion machines will be manufactured for Data General by other companies .
Skates declined to say which firms would provide the machines , though he ruled out the possibility that Compaq Computer Corp. would be among them .
Compaq is in the midst of acquiring Maynard-based Digital Equipment Corp.
Data General said it will also abandon its Thiin Line Internet server products .
These are low-cost Web server computers designed for use by small businesses .
According to Skates , the company found that relatively few customers wanted the small , cheap servers , while customers with major Internet sites preferred the high-end machines .
As a result of the restructuring , Data General will transfer about 100 employees to its Clariion data storage business unit .
Skates said that there was no room in the company for another 400 employees who designed and built the Thiin Line and low-end Aviion systems .
The job cuts will leave Data General with about 4,700 employees , including 1,650 in Massachusetts .
Skates lamented the layoffs , saying that they would cost the company many talented engineers .
`` It 's something we hated to do , '' he said , `` but we had no choice . ''
The stock price of Data General declined 5 / 8 Monday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange , closing at 14 5 / 8.
Data General in April reported a $ 4.5 million loss in its second fiscal quarter , ending March 31 _ its first in 2 1 / 2 years .
But Skates says that loss was unrelated to the layoffs .
`` If we had made a lot of money in the last quarter , we 'd have taken this same action , '' he said .
Skates blamed the loss on delays in bringing out a new line of Clariion data storage devices .
The new systems use a system called Fibre Channel , which allows fast transfers of data between computers and disk storage systems .
Skates said that the full line of products is now available .
Skates said that although Aviion sales have continued to grow , the company couldn n't find a way to make money on the low-end Aviion servers .
According to a report issued Monday by International Data Corp. in Framingham , overall unit sales of servers dropped 11 percent both in the United States and worldwide during the first quarter of 1998 .
Because of lower sales and lower prices , there was a 17 percent decline in revenue from US server sales , and a worldwide decline of 15 percent .
