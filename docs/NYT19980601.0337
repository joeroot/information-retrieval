People with bad health habits that they will not or can not abandon often make excuses : `` What 's the point of living longer _ you 'll only spend more years in a nursing home ? ''
or `` A healthy life really isn n't any longer , it just seems that way . ''
Perhaps the saddest excuse of all dates back to 1964 when the surgeon general issued the first report on smoking and health .
Diehard smokers told me , `` By the time I get lung cancer , they 'll know how to cure it . ''
If only that had happened .
But 34 years later we are hardly closer to curing lung cancer than we were then .
The fact is none of these excuses hold up under the scrutiny of sound medical research , and a recently published study of more than 1,700 men and women followed for 32 years puts the lie to them all .
The study , published in April in The New England Journal of Medicine , clearly showed that people with healthier habits not only live longer , they live better , experiencing only half as much chronic disability as their less-prudent age mates .
The findings strongly suggest that vitality into one 's later years is less a matter of genes and more a question of how a person chooses to live .
Those who smoked the least , stayed trim and exercised regularly not only lived longer but were less likely to develop disabilities .
Even among participants who died , the low-risk people had shorter periods of disability before dying .
In 1980 , Dr. James Fries , professor of medicine at Stanford University , published a provocative article suggesting that preventive health practices would keep Americans healthier longer and change the shape of the nation 's disability and death curve from one that resembles a water slide to one that looks more like a cliff .
According to his `` compression of morbidity '' hypothesis , most Americans , instead of experiencing a more-or-less steady rate of increasing disability and deaths starting at mid-life , could live reasonably well into their 80s , before they begin to die at an accelerated rate .
To put it another way , if people could be persuaded to choose more prudent health habits , the majority would reach their ninth decade in good health and then die after , at most , a relatively brief period of illness .
But some skeptics challenged Fries , suggesting instead that practicing good health habits , while likely to add years to life , would also swell the number of years during which people are beset by chronic illness and disability .
If true , critics said , this would further overwhelm an already overburdened system struggling to care for millions of elderly Americans with costly , debilitating , lingering health problems .
Now , nearly two decades after Fries ' proposal , he and his colleagues have data that dispute the naysayers .
According to their new findings , living healthfully would not only add years to life , it would also add life to years , keeping people well and able to enjoy life far longer than they otherwise might have .
Although the participants ' average age was only 75 at the last assessment , there is every indication that those with healthy habits will on average remain in better health however long they live .
Those whose habits put them at lowest risk for health problems delayed the average age at which they developed even minimal disability by nearly seven years _ to age 73 as against age 66 for those at highest risk .
The researchers tracked 1,741 men and women who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1939 and 1940 .
These alumni were surveyed by other researchers at the time of graduation and again in 1962 , 1976 and 1980 before the Stanford team took over and reassessed their health habits and health status annually for seven years starting in 1986 .
Participants were classified as being at high , moderate or low risk based on three modifiable factors known to contribute to poor health : cigarette smoking , excess weight and inactivity .
At every assessment _ even when the participants were only about 43 years old _ those at highest risk were more likely to report disabilities than those at moderate risk , who in turn had more disabilities than those at low risk .
The authors emphasize that for the overwhelming majority these risk factors are matters of personal choice .
But it is all too obvious that a growing number are making the wrong choices .
Although tens of millions of adults have quit smoking in the last 34 years , we now face the chilling fact that as many as 40 percent of students in some high schools are smoking .
The tobacco industry has been particularly successful in hooking teen-age girls and young blacks on this noxious weed .
And if you think young Americans smoke too much , in many European countries it is hard to find any young person without a cigarette .
Obesity , too , is a growing concern .
Americans on the whole are fatter now than at any time in our history .
People tend to blame the ready availability of high-calorie foods and the constant temptation to eat too much , especially too much fatty , sugary foods .
Few seem to have the will to resist overindulging .
But the food supply and eating habits are not the only culprits .
Inactivity has a major , deleterious influence on the weight of Americans .
Having created a society replete with labor-saving devices , we failed to compensate adequately for our relative inactivity by building more exercise into our daily routines and leisure time .
Only about one American in five gets enough exercise to keep weight down and health up .
And there is virtually no physical activity in the lives of 60 percent of Americans , whose exercise consists of little more than pressing a finger to the television remote .
Yet , those who exercise regularly weigh less and are better able to achieve and maintain weight loss .
Thus , in addition to its direct health benefits , for example , in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer , exercise can help control weight .
Other factors not assessed in the Fries study also influence health .
But the people who stayed trim and exercised , in all likelihood , regularly ate more healthfully as well .
I think you get the point : at any stage of life , it pays to pay attention to preventive health practices .
Good health and longevity are largely in your hands .
