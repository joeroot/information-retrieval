SONOMA , Calif. : `` Holy Moly ! ''
Let 's just stop here and say a Holy Moly from St. Jean is praise of the highest order .
He used Holy Moly to express his fascination with malolactic fermentation , and to describe his joy with delicious , complex wines .
Holy Moly is , frankly , as good as any wine term I 've ever heard , and it 's a lot less snobby .
Before long , a St. Jean Holy Moly may become the wine equivalent of two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert .
You can just see ads in the newspaper : `` Chateau So-and-So is proud to announce that its sauvignon blanc earned the prestigious Holy Moly from Garry St. Jean . ''
We made the transition to red wines , or as Riffo said , `` That 's enough of chardonnay .
Let 's go taste some real wine . ''
St. Jean tasted an estate merlot from the barrel .
Lovely stuff .
`` Why so heavy ? ''
St. Jean asked .
`` It 's not filtered or fined , '' Riffo said , holding his glass up to the light .
The liquid was slightly murky .
St. Jean nodded .
Riffo climbed up seven barrels and brought down a sample of Ravenswood 's Gregory Vineyard Merlot .
`` What do you taste ? ''
he asked .
M.J .
St. Jean looked thoughtful .
`` It 's minty , '' she said .
`` Why ? ''
Riffo smiled .
`` Because the vineyard is bordered by eucalyptus trees .
The oils are carried by the wind and land on the grapes . ''
St. Jean downed his glass of merlot , a look of deep pleasure on his face .
`` I don n't spit it out , '' he said .
`` I drink it . ''
Then he added , `` Holy Moly ! ''
We were greeted at Arrowood by Michael Monahan , hospitality manager .
Arrowood 's owner , Richard Arrowood , used to be the winemaker at St. Jean , put that place on the map before starting his own winery .
He recently opened a new tasting room at Arrowood _ beamed ceilings , fireplace , view of the hills .
It looks like a ski chalet .
Monahan took us to a private tasting room on the second floor .
On a table , he had set out five glasses for each of us .
First we tasted a 1996 Sonoma County Chardonnay , which St. Jean called `` lush , '' but M.J .
found too `` oaky '' for her taste .
Next came a 1996 Saralee 's Vineyard Viognier ( pronounced vee-ohn-yea ) .
You probably know that viognier is the newest white-wine craze .
M.J .
liked it .
`` It smells sweet , but it drinks dry , '' she said .
When she tasted a 1994 Sonoma County Reserve Speciale Cabernet , M.J .
said , `` Wow ! ''
St. Jean said , `` I love it . ''
They sprung for two bottles .
The price , $ 50 apiece .
A 1994 Reserve Merlot was also astonishing , and its price was too : $ 55 .
But by now , St. Jean 's attention was elsewhere .
Each wine came with winemaster 's notes on an elegantly printed card .
St. Jean held up the card .
He said that when he coached , he 'd write his plays on a card just that size .
There would be regular plays and `` need '' plays for when he absolutely had to have a bucket at the end of the game .
These need plays might be run for Chris Mullin , Tim Hardaway or Mitch Richmond .
`` You watch ( Lakers coach ) Del Harris , '' St. Jean said .
`` He holds his card .
Nellie and I keep it in our breast pocket . ''
So you can imagine this scene , right ?
St. Jean is coaching .
There 's one second left in the game .
He 's down by a point .
He reaches into his pocket and frantically grabs the card .
But it 's the wine card .
The players look at him for guidance .
He yells , `` Arrowood 1996 Russian River Valley Viognier . ''
They make the hoop , and all the players think he 's a genius .
We drove to Chateau St. Jean , where Ken Bailey , the hospitality manager and a Warriors season-ticket holder , escorted us upstairs to the Green Room .
It used to be part of a guest suite for VIPs .
St. Jean and M.J .
have slept there several times , surrounded by vineyards and green hills .
A few years ago , the suite was converted to a private tasting and eating room .
Before that happened , Don Nelson 's son Donnie stayed there on his wedding night .
The last people to sleep there before the conversion were Dusty Baker and his wife , Melissa .
When we sat down at the table in the Green Room , we noticed the private menu .
It said : `` Luncheon at the Chateau Honoring our Guests Mr. Lowell Cohn , Mr. Garry St. Jean and Friends . ''
By the way , if you think I 'm bragging about this , you 're right .
They 'd matched a wine with each course , the way they do at fancy restaurants I can never afford .
For example , the 1995 Robert Young Vineyards Chardonnay went with the Salad of Field Greens With Bay Shrimp , Apple and Dried Cranberries Tossed in Tarragon Dressing .
In my tasting notes on the chardonnay , I have St. Jean saying , `` Boy , is that good . ''
He was smiling .
He had learned about chardonnay years ago by drinking the Robert Young , and now , even though time had passed , the wine didn n't disappoint .
St. Jean was falling in love with this wine all over again .
`` I was surprised that it 's only $ 22 , '' he said .
`` I 've tasted more expensive wine that 's not as good .
Obviously , I 'm partial , but this is my favorite . ''
M.J .
said , `` It 's buttery .
I like chardonnay that melts in your mouth . ''
They moved on to the 1995 Pinot Noir , Durell Vineyards from Carneros .
In case you 're wondering , it went with the Wild Mushroom Risotto .
M.J .
was puzzled .
She 's not been exposed often to pinot noir and struggled for a vocabulary to express her feelings .
`` It 's not my favorite of the day by any means , '' she said .
`` But I 'm trying to figure out why .
It 's spicy . ''
She frowned because that didn n't say what she meant .
`` It 's just different for me . ''
St. Jean had no problem with the pinot noir , which , at $ 28 , was a gorgeous rendering of that grape .
And then there was a 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon , Cinq Cepages , a blend of five reds , which went with the beef tenderloin .
St. Jean savored the cab , price $ 24 .
`` A guy like me , '' he said , `` I don n't understand how Arrowood can charge $ 50 , and this doesn n't need to take a backseat . ''
There was much discussion on that subject .
It was decided that with Arrowood , you pay for the name and the limited production along with the high quality .
St. Jean didn n't care .
He took one more sip of the St. Jean cab .
He let it roll along his tongue and slide down his throat .
He gazed at everyone in the room .
`` Holy Moly ! ''
he said .
And he meant it .
