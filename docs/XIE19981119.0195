Share Prices Close Lower in Tokyo
TOKYO , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo Thursday despite indications that the banking sector is forging ahead with plans to boost their capital bases with the help of public funds .
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 244.77 points , or 1.68 percent , from Wednesday 's close to end at 14 , 354.46 .
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index ( TOPIX ) , covering all First Section issues , dropped 9.42 points or 0.85 percent to 1 , 104.00 .
Turnover on the major section was heavy at an estimated 515 million shares , up from Wednesday 's 477.90 million shares .
Aoki was the day 's most heavily traded issue .
Bank shares rose initially on reports that 15 of Japan 's 18 major banks are ready to ask for a combined 4 - 7 trillion yen ( about 32.8 billion dollars-57.4 billion dollars ) in public funds to strengthen capital bases .
But the sector ended marginally lower and analysts pointed out that bank stocks have already rebounded strongly from their lows in September and October .
A sharp afternoon drop in Nikkei 225 futures prices also helped to depress stock prices , traders noted .
In Osaka , the near-term December contract fell 110 points to 14 , 360 .
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section , losers surpassed gainers 659 to 492 , with 142 issues remaining unchanged .
