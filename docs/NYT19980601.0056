BENDER DIED OF SEIZURE , FAMILY SAYS BY RON KROICHICK
BENDER-SFCHRON c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle
OAKLAND , Calif. _ An empty , wrenching feeling revisited the Raiders this weekend , after the sudden and unexpected death of rookie defensive tackle Leon Bender .
Nearly nine years ago , in the summer of 1989 , safety Stacey Toran died in a car accident .
Now owner Al Davis and his team mourn the loss of Bender , the victim of an apparent seizure .
`` Al was devastated , like everyone is , '' club executive Bruce Allen said Sunday .
`` He had such high hopes for Leon .
.
.
.
He ( Davis ) just wants to make sure everyone sticks together and helps the family as much as we can . ''
Bender , 22 , was found dead Saturday in Marietta , Ga. He collapsed in the home of Terry Bolar , an associate of Bender 's agent , Eugene Parker .
Bolar discovered Bender 's body in the bathroom .
Bender 's family and Parker _ in a statement issued after Sunday 's preliminary autopsy _ said Bender died `` from complications resulting from a seizure . ''
He had had an epileptic condition since childhood .
The statement also said , `` Although the final and conclusive report will not be available for two weeks , the coroner at this time has ruled out foul play , drugs or alcohol as factors in his death . ''
Cobb County ( Ga. ) police said autopsy results were inconclusive .
According to a recorded message left by police spokesman Robert Quigley , `` no foul play is suspected '' in Bender 's death .
Bender took regular medication to control his epilepsy , in part at the urging of his wife , Liza .
Bender spent the past two weeks of his life away from Liza , working out with a personal trainer near Atlanta .
A spokeswoman for the Cobb County medical examiner 's office said there was no indication that medication contributed to Bender 's death .
More test results will become available later this week .
Allen said the Raiders were aware of Bender 's medical condition when they selected him in the second round of the NFL draft on April 18 .
Bender had at least one seizure during his days at Santana High School , near San Diego .
`` It had not been a problem at all during most of his college career , '' Allen said .
`` With the proper medication , it appeared to be under control .
Everyone on our medical staff was confident of that . ''
Bender was eager to join the Raiders .
He signed a five-year , $ 3.45 million contract on May 12 ; the deal included a $ 1.2 million signing bonus .
Bender was paid the bonus before his death .
By all accounts , Bender was a large ( 6-foot-5 , 320 pounds ) and gentle man .
Janay Leddy , the graduate assistant in Washington State 's sports information office , referred to Bender 's `` infectious '' smile .
`` When you looked him in the eye , he had a sparkle , '' Allen said .
`` They were happy eyes .
He didn n't mind smiling or laughing out loud .
His enthusiasm was very contagious . ''
Bender 's demeanor was evident April 23 , at the Raiders ' practice facility in Alameda .
That day , the team formally introduced its top four draft choices to the local media .
Bender sat at a table alongside fullback Jon Ritchie , offensive tackle Mo Collins and cornerback Charles Woodson .
Most questions sailed toward Woodson , last year 's Heisman Trophy winner .
Finally , when someone addressed Bender , he took a playful dig at Woodson .
Bender sarcastically referred to the referees prematurely walking off the field in the Rose Bowl game , as his WSU team staged a belated comeback against Woodson and Michigan .
Woodson laughed .
Bender wore a wide smile throughout the press conference on that day , barely more than five weeks ago .
He seemed almost giddy , clearly excited about his impending career playing professional football .
Sadly and suddenly , Bender 's career ended before it ever started .
A memorial service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at Emanuel Baptist Church in Pullman , Wash. Funeral arrangements in San Diego are pending .
