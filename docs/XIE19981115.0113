NEW DELHI , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has written to U.S. President Bill Clinton expressing his unhappiness over a shift in Washington 's stand in its dialogue with New Delhi , the Hindustan Times reported Sunday .
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott , in his widely publicized address to the Brookings Institute earlier this week , revealed for the first time the contents of the negotiations between the two countries .
In his letter to Clinton , Vajpayee complained that Washington breached an understanding reached earlier on the mode of the talks .
However , the Hindustan Times did not say when the letter was written .
There are misgivings in New Delhi over the timing of Talbott 's revelation since the seventh round of his negotiations with Indian Prime Minister 's special envoy Jaseant Singh is scheduled for next Thursday in Rome .
Indian termed on Saturday as " coercive and counter-productive " the action of the United State on Friday barring 40 Indian entities along with their more than 200 subsidiaries from having any kind of business or trade relations with U.S. companies .
