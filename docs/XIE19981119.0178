The news agency quoted Lesotho government officials as saying that the meeting will focus on bilateral issues between the two countries , and that the two leaders are also expected to discuss political developments in Lesotho .
The Lesotho opposition alliance , accusing the government of harassment , Monday suspended talks with the Mosisili administration and Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) mediators .
The SADC mediators said Thursday that it remains convinced that the Lesotho government and opposition parties are still committed to the launch of the interim political authority ( IPA ) tasked to prepare for fresh elections due within 18 months .
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki 's spokesman , Ronnie Mamoepa , said : " In this regard , the Lesotho government and opposition parties have expressed their wish to see the launch of the IPA take place sooner than later . "
The establishment of the IPA was agreed upon after difficult negotiations between the Lesotho government and the opposition .

The unrest boiled up to a major political crisis in September and ultimately led to military intervention by SADC forces .
