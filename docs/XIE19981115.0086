UN International Staff Not Yet Return to Afghanistan
ISLAMABAD , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The United Nations international staff have not yet returned to Afghanistan due to the Taliban militia 's failure to fully implement the agreement reached last month .
The News Network International quoted a U.N. official as saying Sunday , " We have not yet sent international staff to Afghanistan and are still waiting for progress on the security agreement by the Taliban . "
The Taliban and the U.N. signed a " security agreement " in Islamabad on October 23 which had made the militia responsible for the security of U.N. personnel and U.N. premises in Afghanistan .
The U.N pulled about 50 foreign workers out of Afghanistan on August 21 after the killing of an Italian U.N. worker who was shot dead during an angry demonstration against the U.S. cruise missile attack on Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden in the eastern province of Khost .
Under the agreement , a small team of the U.N. staff would have to return to Afghanistan to assess the situation after progress on the agreement by the Taliban .
However , the U.N. official said the accord has not been fully implemented .
The return of international U.N. staff depends on implementation of the agreement , he added .
The Taliban are bound , under the accord , to give a detailed report about the killing of three staff members in the Taliban-controlled areas this year .
However , the Taliban are reported to have failed to present a satisfactory report .
Under the agreement , the Taliban would have to provide protection to the U.N. premises .
It also guaranteed that if any U.N. staff member is detained they should be released within 72 hours in the absence of formal charges against them .
The U.N. and other international relief agencies have other outstanding issues with the Taliban including equal access to women and girls , adequate health care for women and restrictions on working women .
However , the agreement did not mention the women issue .
