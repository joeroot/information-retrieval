UNDATED : this era .
Because Ford 's vision was so jaded , it was terminal .
Ford has performed like Paul Newman in `` The Hustler . ' He has nearly cleared the table , and left those who follow him in the game not a single clear shot .
How does any designer follow a collection that reads as utterly bored with artifice , when , after all , fashion is only artifice ?
Even Ford has found himself in a creative cul-de-sac .
In trying to undo the jaded esthetic that Ford has wrought , some designers have opted for ultra-romantic and ultra-ornamental .
Unfortunately , those tricks are the generic goop of fashion design , owned by no one , used at one time by everyone , but certainly not the basis for anyone 's breakthrough .
Young designers who have received the most attention of late _ and youth is relative _ are those who have proven not that they have inventive ideas , but those who have proven they can toe the commercial line .
But the creative lull isn n't being caused only by the timid younger generation .
There 's a lot of graceful aging going on in fashion , with no small help from Botox injections and behind-the-scenes staffs full of young , uncredited advisers .
What fashion needs right now is for some of its aging designers to be a little ungraceful , take a risk , a big risk .
Think Warren Beatty making `` Bulworth , '' not Robert Redford making `` The Horse Whisperer . ''
Gucci is now a billion-dollar company , built on a generation 's fascination with sex and cynicism and a designer 's savvy in tapping into it .
`` That really had a huge effect on fashion , on the way people dressed , '' Ford said .
`` It made what we did in the mid - '90s possible .
The kind of sexuality that was dangerous .
Beauty , but non-touchable beauty .
Slightly hostile , angry fashion . ''
That has run its course .
But no one yet has found a more optimistic way to express the same sophistication .
Perhaps sophistication became too synonymous with cynicism .
For fashion , moving on might mean embracing a little innocence .
