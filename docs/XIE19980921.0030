Libyan Criticizes Dutch-British Proposal on
CAIRO , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Libya on Sunday criticized a Dutch-British proposal of holding the trial of two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing at a military camp in the Netherlands .
In a statement carried by Libya 's JANA news agency , the Foreign Ministry also demanded an agreement of all sides involved in the matter , including the defendants ' lawyers , on the trial site .
Dutch and British officials agreed last Friday to hold the trial at Camp Zeist in the former U.S. Soesterberg airbase , some 30 kilometers south of Amsterdam .
Such an arrangement will deny the defendants a " calm atmosphere " and does not facilitate a fair trial , the statement said , saying " Couldn n't any other place than a military camp be found ? "
The bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie , Scotland in 1988 killed 270 people .
Libya has accepted a British-U.S .
proposal to try the two suspects by Scottish judges under Scottish laws in the Netherlands .
