Gulf States Consider to End Dollar Link
ABU DHABI , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Gulf Arab states are considering to unlink their currencies from the U.S. dollar to guard against persistent fluctuations and prevent further loss in oil income , according to a senior Gulf official .
" There is a general trend in the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) states to detach the national currencies from the dollar and consider linking them to a basket of world currencies to avoid the negative effects on oil exports , " Mohammed al Mulla , secretary general of the GCC chambers of commerce and industry was quoted by the UAE 's Wam news as saying Thursday .
" The GCC countries are waiting for the creation of the single European Union currency ... , but this issue needs a political decision although it is supported by the economists and other concerned parties in the region , " he said .
With the exception of Kuwait , whose dinar is linked to a basket of major world currencies , the currencies of the other five GCC members are pegged to the U.S. dollar .
The six GCC members , namely , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Oman , Qatar and Kuwait , have discussed a joint peg for their currencies as part of plans to intergrate their economies and create a common market .
But they have failed to reach any agreement as some members expressed reservations on unlinking their currencies from the dollar on the grounds that it is the official price of oil and it could be interpreted as a political issue .
The GCC states export more than 12 million barrels of oil per day , fetching them nearly two thirds of their total income .
It was estimated that in the past years , the GCC states have lost billions of dollars in oil revenues and higher import bills because of the decline in the dollar against other major currencies .
