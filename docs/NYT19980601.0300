A RADICAL IDEA : KICKING THE SPENDING HABIT
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By DIANE WHITE c.1998 The Boston Globe THE OVERSPENT AMERICAN Upscaling , Downshifting , and the New Consumer By Juliet B. Schor .
Basic Books .
253 pp .
Illustrated .
$ 25 .
When I was a little girl my grandmother always said the same thing whenever I 'd ask her to buy me something .
The words `` I want ... ''
would barely pass my lips when she 'd answer , `` Want , want , want .
Want will be your master . ''
Grandma was wise , as usual .
Want is more than ever our master , according to Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor , who in `` The Overspent American '' argues that we are financially and psychologically enslaved by `` competitive consumerism . ''
We know we spend too much money on stuff we don n't really need .
We read about it , we hear about it , we talk about it , we complain about it .
But most of us keep doing it .
So while Schor 's book is interesting , with some important things to say about the excesses of consumerism , you have to ask : Will she succeed in persuading readers to change their ways , to `` downshift '' their lives in the direction of less work and less spending ?
Schor devotes a chapter to suggestions aimed at reducing the relentless creep of consumerism , among them : avoid `` occasions of sin '' ( i.e. , malls , stores , catalogs , shopaholic friends ) ; don n't be taken in by the desire for status symbols ; learn to share ; don n't use shopping as `` therapy '' ; de-commercialize Christmas , weddings , and other occasions .
A few people may take inspiration from these and other ideas in `` The Overspent American , '' because anybody who picks up this book is probably already leaning , if only slightly , in Schor 's direction .
However , most people will never hear of the book , and even if they were to read it the author 's ideas would not likely have any effect on their spending .
The majority of Americans enjoy competitive consuming too much _ it 's practically our national pastime .
To give it up would be to surrender part of our identity because , just as Schor explains at length in this book , we are what we acquire .
Our buying habits are tightly bound to the image we want to present to the world , she writes .
We are what we buy .
Or , more precisely , we aspire to be what we buy .
`` This is not to say that most Americans make consumer purchases solely to fool others about who we really are , '' she writes , `` that we are a nation of crass status-seekers . ''
We 're not ?
Well , it 's not that simple , according to Schor , who continues , `` Many of us are continually comparing our own lifestyle and possessions to those of a select group of people we respect and want to be like , people whose sense of what 's important in life seems close to our own . ''
The problem is that the `` select group '' has changed over the years .
We used to want to keep up with those famous Joneses who lived next door .
The Jones family may have made a little more money than we did , but basically we were in the same financial ballpark .
Now , though , the neighbors no longer provide the benchmark .
We 've upscaled .
We want to live like the rich and famous , like the celebrities and CEOs we read about and see on TV .
`` The result is that millions of us have become participants in a national culture of upscale spending , '' Schor writes .
`` I call it the new consumerism . ''
Schor sees the new consumerism as a source of profound stress , dissatisfaction , frustration .
Why can n't we have a country house like Martha Stewart 's ?
Or an apartment like one we see on `` Frasier '' ?
Why can n't we take a vacation in Bora Bora like those people we read about in last Sunday 's travel section ?
Common sense provides the answer , or it would if common sense had anything to do with competitive consuming , which it doesn n't .
Like spoiled children we want what we want , even if we know we can n't afford it , even if upscaling means going deeply into debt , even courting bankruptcy .
Competitive consuming is not confined to those with limited incomes , Schor writes ; on the contrary .
It thrives and creates problems at all income levels , and it 's most acute in the middle and upper-middle classes .
Schor 's own 1994 - ' 95 survey of 80,000 workers employed by a telecommunications company revealed that 27 percent of those in households with incomes of more than $ 100,000 a year said they couldn n't afford to buy everything they need .
The key word here is `` need . ''
Our concept of `` need '' has changed in the last few decades , Schor writes .
What we want swiftly becomes what we `` need . ''
Many of us walk around with an ever-present wish list of things we `` need '' to buy .
Were our expectations always so high ?
No. We weren n't quite this flagrantly acquisitive until fairly recently .
Schor writes that competitive consuming took off like a rocket in what she calls `` the decade of greed , '' between 1979 and 1989 , when the rich and super-rich took conspicuous consumption to extraordinary levels .
Their excesses reverberated through the upper part of the upper-middle class , who began acquiring luxury status symbols .
These upper-middles , writes Schor , have come to define material success and provide the visible lifestyle to which most Americans aspire .
Schor explores the ways in which people become competitive consumers .
The pressures of advertising .
The desire to keep up with the high-status buying of others .
The allure of consuming as a kind of fantasy fulfillment , as the `` enchanted domain '' of consumer culture , as she calls it .
She cites studies indicating that people spend an enormous amount of time fantasizing about what they 'd like to acquire .
She quotes one woman who dreams of her `` perfect '' house : `` The awe and respect and wonder of my guests are basic to every daydream about my house . ''
Many of these consumer dreams are destined to remain dreams , not just because they were unrealistic to start with , but because for most people it 's becoming more and more difficult to keep up with rising levels of consumption .
Family finances have deteriorated .
Credit-card debt is at an all-time high .
Bankruptcies abound .
The national savings rate has plummeted .
The average American household currently saves only 3.5 percent of its disposable income .
The zeal to consume more goods threatens the quality of people 's personal lives , Schor writes .
They have to work harder and longer to afford more things .
They skimp on college funds , retirement savings , and health insurance so they can buy more .
She argues that Americans are increasingly angry and resentful about having to pay taxes to support schools , parks , public transportation , and programs for the poor because they see taxes as subtracting from the money they need to finance their private consumption .
A large part of Schor 's book is devoted to the personal stories of downshifters , people who are voluntarily opting out of the consumer economy , with its stress , debt , lack of free time , and competitive consumption .
The simplicity movement has been gaining ground in recent years .
Schor notes that there 's no `` typical '' downshifter profile , and her interviews bear that out , though many of the people she talked with had one thing in common : They hated their jobs and were willing to chance almost anything for a change .
The stories are not particularly inspiring .
Some have adjusted .
Others have struggled , trading in old stresses for new , like the woman who gave up an extremely high-pressure nursing job for occasional per-diem work and now frets about whether she can afford to buy a sandwich for lunch , or get her teeth cleaned .
Want is still her master , but the level of her wants has moved downscale .
