FROM DEMAGOGUE TO DEMI-GOD : REMEMBERING BARRY GOLDWATER

WASHINGTON _ He opposed restrictions on abortion , supported gays in the military and thought Pat Robertson 's religious right was a bunch of `` kooks . ''
To hear the television news and read the obituaries , you might have thought that Barry Goldwater was a liberal .
Of course the right-wing senator from Arizona who died on Friday was a liberal , in many of the ways that the word is used in Britain .
He was in the Manchester tradition , a foe of government intervention and an individualist .
In America being a liberal means being something else _ a friend of the state _ and so Goldwater 's lifelong crusade was against liberalism .
But in his later years he found himself often at odds with the Republican Party , over abortion , school prayers and gay rights , as they became more authoritarian .
Nonetheless , the ease with which the mainstream media in America slid into eulogy was slightly disturbing .
`` Barry Goldwater was a politician who stood by his own salty views , '' the New York Times said in an editorial , failing to point out that it had long regarded most of these salty views as a grave threat to the nation .
He had , after all , saltily suggested using low-yield nuclear weapons in Vietnam .
Saltily , he had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act which started to dismantle apartheid in America 's South .
The warmth of the reaction from President Bill Clinton to Goldwater 's death was also slightly surprising .
When Goldwater ran in 1964 , as the Washington Post pointed out , he was regarded as `` a demagogue and a leader of right-wing extremists and fascists who was likely to lead the United States into nuclear war , eliminate civil rights progress and destroy such social welfare programs as Social Security . ''
Alternatively , as Clinton put it , he was `` a great patriot and a truly fine human being . ''
Part of the reason for the mellowing of opinion towards Goldwater is that he remained in favor of personal choice , while the fanatics of the religious right were colonizing conservatism .
`` A lot of so-called conservatives today don n't know what the word means , '' he told the Los Angeles Times in 1994 .
`` They think I 've turned liberal because I believe a woman has a right to an abortion .
That 's a decision that 's up to a pregnant woman , not up to the Pope or some do-gooders or the religious right . ''
That and similar lines were much quoted yesterday as evidence that Barry hadn n't been so bad after all .
Goldwater was in a way an American Enoch Powell .
He crystallized the rise of conservatism , a John the Baptist figure who stood slightly outside politics , yet created a permanent change in it .
Yet Goldwater has had his effect on British politics as surely as if he had been born and raised in the East End .
He began the wave of reaction that crashed on to our shores in 1979 .
He helped to make politics what it is now in Britain and America , which is why so many found such kind things to say about a man once regarded as a lunatic .
