& HT ; COMMENTARY : A short guide to the nouns of summer & HT ; By Mark Lane & HT ; c.
1998 Cox News Service
One neat thing about summer is the way it can be put in front of another word to suggest something fleeting and not to be taken seriously .
Is that literature ?
No , it 's summer reading .
Are those kids getting serious ?
No , it 's just a summer romance .
Is this an engaging and thoughtful film that shimmers with unexpected insights into the human condition ?
Naw , just a summer movie .
You mean he 's finally getting to work at school ?
No , he just wants to hang out in the student union and meet girls in summer dresses in summer school .
Are you going to work at a video store all your life ?
No , it 's just a summer job .
There is nothing similar in the other three seasons .
No fall romances , winter reading or spring jobs .
I 'm sure fall romances exist , but the language doesn n't support them .
Such lovers are unsanctioned and probably in for a long , cold winter .
Spring jobs may work out that way but aren n't generally entered into with that idea .
Winter reading is too grim to contemplate except for a degree .
We use `` summer '' as a modifier because it conjures brighter , happier , more irresponsible images than any other season .
It should be used more widely if we are going to give summer its due .
Here are a few suggestions for starts :
SUMMER NEWS -- Stories that only gain attention because it 's a slow news cycle .
The major institutions of government are on vacation or at half-speed .
In the Sunbelt , the heat can even slow down outdoor criminal activity because it just requires too much exertion .
Summer news is big on lottery jackpots , Beanie Babies , anniversaries , proto-trends , pre-pre-election handicapping and celebrities of the second-tier , rediscovered or recovering kind .
SUMMER SOFTWARE -- Clever , cheap and not overly practical programs , usually downloaded from the Internet and installed for only a few months .
Example : a program that simulates the old Magic Eight Ball .
Click and it will display messages like : `` Concentrate and Ask Again . ''
And `` Signs Point to Yes . ''
It will be off the hard drive before the lunch boxes hit supermarket shelves .
SUMMER SHOCK -- The sudden realization that school will be over in only a few weeks and you have no idea what you 'll do with the kids .
SUMMER HIT -- Every summer there will be one song , one happy , light song that will be played on seemingly every radio station in the country as well as on MTV , VH-1 and the stereo in the next apartment .
Its simple , infectious tune will induce ` It 's a Small World After All ' Syndrome and come to you unbidden in your sleep .
Its first three bars will have the ability to make you climb walls by August , begging to be put out of your misery .
Then , by September , all trace of it will vanish from the earth for 20 years .
After that time , it will be converted to a piece of amusing campy nostalgia for kids .
( This should not be confused with summer music , which is just about anything by Jimmy Buffett . )
SUMMER PROJECT -- An oxymoron .
The opposite of `` summer '' is `` power . ''
People put the word `` power '' in front of perfectly harmless nouns to suggest an activity more purposeful , self-improving and dynamic than you would otherwise suspect .
For example , a `` power breakfast '' puts a whole new spin on a bowl of cereal .
It is supposed evoke hitting the ground running instead of sitting and staring into the scrambled eggs .
I would counter it with a `` summer breakfast '' which is never served before 10 a.m.
`` Power napping '' is supposed to show that you are recharging for the next task .
`` Summer napping '' is best done in a place where nobody can find you for the next task .
`` Power walking '' is fast-paced , timed and on a set course .
`` Summer walking '' might take you just about anywhere and make you late for everything else .
I could write about this more comprehensively , but that would be contrary to the spirit of the season .
This is only meant to be a summer column .
