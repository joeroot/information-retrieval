SMALL STOCKS REMAIN LOW DESPITE RISING TIDE

NEW YORK _ A rising tide lifts only big boats .
Ask any investor who owns small-capitalization stocks .
He will tell you that the old saw about bull markets levitating all stocks no longer holds true .
While the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index are both up more than 13 percent so far this year , the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index has barely budged from the level at which it began the year .
Even worse , this frustrating performance has come as a throng of market seers and Wall Street pundits have repeatedly proclaimed small-cap stocks to be cheap and poised for a move .
The throng is only half right _ small stocks are cheap .
The price-to-earnings ratio of the Salomon Smith Barney emerging growth index stands at 1.13 times that of the S&AMP ; P 500 .
It has been cheaper on only two occasions since 1979 : during the market plunge of 1987 and the 1990 recession .
It is much more common for small stocks to trade at premiums of 1.5 times to 2.25 times the S&AMP ; P Just two years ago , for example , the P/E on the Salomon Smith Barney index was double that of the S&AMP ; P 500 .
But just because small stocks are cheap does not mean that they are poised to move .
Indeed , this is the paradox facing small-cap stock investors , patiently waiting for their stocks to come to life .
Their companies may have real products , solid financials and seasoned managements , but their stocks still trade at depressing discounts to investor favorites like Yahoo Inc. or Netscape Communications Corp. , which have no sales and no earnings .
What many small-cap investors do not realize is that they could be waiting quite a long time for their shares to bounce .
In fact , the lid on small-stock prices is the result of a confluence of events in the market and it is not likely to be lifted soon .
Small stocks , worthy of investor attention though they may be , could remain in the cellar for the duration .
If small stocks continue to lag behind , investors will need to do some serious rethinking of their expectations for these shares .
And the underperformance could cast doubt on the long-held assumption that small stocks always outperform large stocks over time .
This does not mean that small stocks are bad investments , of course .
But because most people with money in the market like to see positive results sooner not later , it is likely that small stocks will continue to disappoint even the most patient investor .
L. Keith Mullins , an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney , likens small-cap stocks to real estate in Chernobyl .
`` It might be cheap , but who wants to buy it ? ''
What is keeping small stocks down ?
A series of factors , both large and small , obvious and obscure .
The biggest factor in small-stock underperformance is the dominance of institutional investors in today 's markets .
Direct stock ownership by individuals has fallen to about 47 percent of all U.S. equities last year from 91 percent in 1952 .
Individuals have handed over management of their portfolios to professionals who run mutual funds and pension funds .
Because many of these professionals have billions of dollars under management , they require easy entry and exit from the stocks they buy .
Being able to buy a $ 5 million position in a stock without pushing its price up is known as liquidity , and the demand for it among institutional investors has driven prices of the large-capitalization stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average and at the top of the S&AMP ; P 500 to record valuations .
Meanwhile , small stocks lag behind .
`` The demand for liquidity has created a new class of stocks we call orphans , '' said J.D .
Sullivan Jr. , vice president of Carleton , McCreary , Holmes & AMP ; Co. , the Cleveland-based investment banking arm of Keycorp .
`` The people with all the money can n't own them , so they have not enjoyed the same kind of value appreciation enjoyed by the market as a whole . ''
At the same time that the demand for deep liquidity in stocks has risen among institutional investors , liquidity among many small stocks is in decline , making them even less likely to be traded by professionals .
Perhaps the biggest contributor to illiquidity among small stocks is the change in Nasdaq market trading rules , which took effect last year .
The new rules , mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission , require that a Nasdaq market maker post an investor 's price for a stock if it falls between the firm 's bid and offer prices .
Posting an outsider 's price on a Nasdaq stock is good for investors .
It has had the effect of narrowing the difference between what an investor must pay to buy a stock _ the ask _ and the price at which he or she sells it _ the bid .
But the rules have hurt the big Nasdaq market-making firms .
That is because the difference between the bid and ask on a stock , known as the spread , is often pocketed by the trading firms .
Therefore , these firms are earning much less from trading small stocks today than they did before the rule change .
Result ?
Major brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch , Salomon Smith Barney and Bear , Stearns are cutting back on the number of Nasdaq or small-cap stocks they trade for their customers .
We are not talking about big , actively traded stocks like Cisco Systems , Oracle or 3 Com Corp. , which continue to have many firms trading their shares .
But a more obscure stock that might once have had 10 market makers , could easily now be down to five .
A result of fewer firms making markets in a stock is much less liquidity .

Small-stock investors face more problems than just a lack of liquidity .
According to James Paulsen , chief investment officer of Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis , small companies are likely to be hurt by declining inflation much more than big companies are .
Small companies , with their lower overhead and more nimble operations , have traditionally won customers by doing what their bigger competitors do more cheaply .
But , Paulsen contends , declining inflation forces big companies to reduce their prices , stealing low-price thunder from small concerns .
In addition , small companies are less likely to have either the capital to invest in technology to lower their costs or the money to buy other companies to achieve economies of scale .
`` In a disinflationary world , small companies can n't compete as easily with big companies , '' Paulsen said .
As proof of his theory , Paulsen pointed to small-cap stock performance during other periods of low inflation or deflation going back to 1925 .
Small-cap stocks underperformed their larger colleagues throughout the 1920s and 1930s , when inflation was low or in negative territory .
Only when the Consumer Price Index surged in 1945 , did small stocks start to recover .
Then again , in 1975 , when inflation started to pick up , so did small stocks .
` It 's my belief that the small-stock outperformance over the last 70 years is a result of the fact that the period had more inflation than less , '' Paulsen said .
`` If low inflation continues , that could change the outlook for small stocks . ''
Disinflation could explain the intriguing deterioration in operating margins among small companies recently identified by Christine Callies , investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York .
In the first quarter of this year , operating margins at companies whose market capitalizations were among the top one-fifth came in at an average 13.5 percent .
Those in the second and third quintiles showed operating margins of around 11 percent .
But operating margins among the smallest companies _ those in the fourth and fifth quintiles in market cap _ averaged 9.3 percent and 5.4 percent , respectively .
Ms. Callies pointed out that the drag on small-company performance was not limited to the first quarter ; margin deterioration among these concerns was a constant through the second half of 1997 as well .
She also noted two more reasons that small stocks are not likely to recover anytime soon .
First , a bull market in small caps has never materialized near the middle or end of an overall advance in stock prices like the one we are in .
And second , recent data from the Federal Reserve Board shows a surge in foreign buying of American equities .
`` Foreign investors prefer large-cap companies with global names , '' Ms. Callies said .
This goes a long way toward explaining the recent outperformance of the S&AMP ; P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials .
Rising tide indeed .
