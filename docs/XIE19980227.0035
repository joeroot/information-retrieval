Cyprus Denies Purchase of Russian Tanks
NICOSIA , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The Cypriot government Thursday denied press reports that it has signed a 20-million-U.S . - dollar deal to buy 40 Russian-made T-80U tanks .
" We deny a report that we have bought T-80 tanks .
We had bought T-80 tanks in 1995 , which have upgraded our defense , " government spokesman Manolis Christofides said at his daily press briefing .
Media reports said that the Cypriot government had signed the deal to buy the tanks from an arms factory in the Siberian city of Omsk in Russia .
The Speaker of the Omsk National Assembly , Vladimir Varnavsky , was quoted as saying that the Cypriot government had given a three-million-dollar down payment for the tanks .
Press reports said that any new arms deal would heighten tension in Cyprus , with the delivery of Russian-made S-300 missiles set for late summer this year .
The Cypriot government signed an agreement with Russia early 1997 to purchase S-300 surface-to-air missiles to upgrade its defense .
The deal angered Turkey which has threatened to strike the missiles if they are deployed .
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia .
