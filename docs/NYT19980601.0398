HARRISON FORD : STARDOM WITH A SHRUG
( This `` separate buy '' article is from this week 's StarBeat entertainment package . ) ( To publish this article , it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1 - 800-444-0267 or 816 - 822-8448 , or by fax at 816 - 822-1444 . ) ( She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat , a weekly package of five intriguing features with color art . ) Includes a color slide of Harrison Ford with Anne Heche in a scene from `` Six Days , Seven Nights . ''
By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & HT ; Some questions apparently have to be asked , especially about Harrison Ford 's new film , `` Six Days , Seven Nights , '' which co-stars Anne Heche .
& HT ; No , not the ones about Heche 's high-profile lesbianism _ she 's Ellen DeGeneres ' companion _ or how it affected Ford 's romantic scenes with her in the desert-island film .
& HT ; No , not any of the who 're - you-sleeping-with-lately questions that spice many current interviews .
Ford is notorious for his unwillingness to get personal .
& HT ; `` It is unseemly to air your problems in public , '' the actor says .
`` Plus I don n't feel any obligation to make myself sound interesting to a reporter .
The most interesting thing about what I do is up there on the screen for everyone to see . ''
& HT ; No , apparently what inquiring minds want to know is what would Harrison Ford take with him to a real-life desert island ?
& HT ; In a day of interviews at Manhattan 's Essex House , he 's been asked the question 27 times in English , plus two in Spanish .
For the record , here are some of the answers : & HT ; `` I 'd bring my wife and children .
Is that one choice or three ? ''
& HT ; `` Some books , but I don n't know what . ''
& HT ; `` Gold Coast hot dogs from Chicago . ''
& HT ; `` I just don n't know . ''
& HT ; And then there are the more specialized questions .
& HT ; `` I don n't know what cereal I would bring to a desert island .
I do not eat cereal . ''
& HT ; And now Ford is heading into a press conference with a whole room of foreign reporters .
& HT ; `` Right now that desert island is looking pretty good , '' he whispers as he heads in .
& HT ; He settles in , and the first question is asked .
& HT ; `` Mr. Ford , let 's say you were really stranded on an island .
What would you bring ? ''
& HT ; Ford pops a peanut M&AMP ; M , as if to give himself time to think .
& HT ; `` Hmmm , you seem to be the first person who has thought of that one , '' he begins .
& HT ; Ford has answered a lot of questions in his time , most of them many times .
It 's no surprise _ after all , he remains the biggest-box-office draw in Hollywood history , having starred in films that sold more than $ 2 billion worth of tickets .
& HT ; `` I read those numbers .
I don n't relate , '' Ford says , relaxing after the press conference in a suite at the hotel , looking handsome in a dark-olive suit , his hair cropped short and a hint of a tan on his face .
& HT ; `` I don n't take it personally , '' he adds .
`` I 'm very lucky to have stumbled upon those roles .
It 's my enormous good fortune .
I 'm glad people take some pleasure in them . ''
& HT ; Ford has been on a roll of late , with `` Clear and Present Danger '' ( 1995 ) , `` The Devil 's Own '' ( 1997 ) and `` Air Force One '' ( 1997 ) all having scored at the box office .
& HT ; `` Six Days , Seven Nights , '' which opens June 12 , varies the action formula of those three films , casting Ford as a rough bush pilot who crashes his plane on a desert island , ending up stranded with his passenger , an imperious magazine editor played by Heche .
& HT ; `` It 's kind of an ` African Queen ' type of situation , '' Ford says .
`` It 's an unlikely love story . ''
& HT ; Heche 's relationship with DeGeneres began _ and went public _ after she 'd already been cast in the film .
Suddenly everyone was buzzing about whether there could be romantic chemistry between Ford and half of Hollywood 's most famous lesbian duo .
& HT ; `` I think we have great chemistry .
It 's called casting , '' Ford says with a bit of an edge to his voice .
`` Anne impressed us the first time we read with her .
We knew she 'd bring something unique to the film .
She has a slightly off-center sense of humor .
She also brought great wit and energy , and she is a very skilled actress .
She 's a natural . ''
& HT ; As for her sexuality , Ford says it 's not an issue : `` I could care less about my co-stars ' personal lives . ''
& HT ; Most of Ford 's characters have been men of action who were nonetheless sensitive , caring people .
That isn n't necessarily the case this time out .
& HT ; `` I don n't know the exact definition of a guy 's guy anymore , '' the actor says , `` but I guess it 's someone who says , ` Take what you get , warts and all . ' I play a man who is not exactly PC , but what he lacks in manners he makes up for in passion .
& HT ; `` Maybe it 's nice to see this guy because we 're a little too serious about male-female parameters these days , '' Ford says .
`` I understood his pain and his ambition to control his life by simplifying .
I personally empathized with that one . ''
& HT ; Actually , as movie stars ' lives go , Ford 's is already pretty simplified .
He lives in Wyoming with his wife _ Melissa Mathison , screenwriter of `` ET '' ( 1982 ) _ and their children , coming to Hollywood only to work .
& HT ; `` I don n't do the star thing , '' he says .
`` I don n't do premieres , I don n't talk about my charities .
You don n't need me to nominate a cause . ''
& HT ; His success , Ford says , means only one thing to him .
& HT ; `` It means that I have the opportunity to have some control over the work that I do , '' he says .
`` And that is what is really important . ''
& HT ; Unlike many actors , however , Ford doesn n't use that control to experiment with more risky roles in lower-budget art films .
He feels no great need to `` stretch , '' as actors say .
& HT ; `` You know what would happen ?
The press would treat it like a big Hollywood movie , and that 's not good for the movie , '' Ford says .
`` That 's what happened when I did a smaller film like ` Regarding Henry ' ( 1991 ) .
It was supposed to be a little film , but the press blew it out of proportion .
And that was tough on the movie .
& HT ; `` I like the kinds of movies that I do , '' he says firmly .
`` My sense of this is that I 'm in a service occupation .
I am a storyteller , and movies are so expensive these days that you have to tell your story well .
I want to tell stories that people around the campfire want to hear . ''
& HT ; Among those stories are upcoming reprises of his roles as Jack Ryan and Indiana Jones , but not as Han Solo , who won n't be seen in the new `` Star Wars '' prequels .
& HT ; `` The truth is , I wanted Han Solo to die at the end of the last one , but George Lucas didn n't find that too amusing , '' Ford says .
`` I 'm pleased George Lucas has found something that interests him again .
But I don n't feel involved in it at all in the prequels , except I know my kids will enjoy them . ''
& HT ; Ryan and Jones should be enough to ensure that Ford will stay on top of the Hollywood heap for the foreseeable future _ a prospect that he sees as not an unmixed blessing .
& HT ; `` My anonymity is almost like a commodity I would like to buy back , '' he says , sipping coffee .
& HT ; That isn n't likely , however , which was borne home to him recently when he was pursuing one of his fascinations , flying .
Fog forced him to make an unscheduled landing at an airport in Trenton , N.J .
& HT ; Waiting for the fog to lift , he reports , `` I started to wander around the airport .
I got a lot more attention than I ever imagined .
& HT ; `` It 's so funny , '' he says .
`` It 's like people have radar detectors and they center in on me .
They will mouth , ` You 're Harrison Ford . ' & HT ; `` I used to shake my head as in , ` No , I just look like him , '' ' the actor says , smiling .
`` Now I just wink and nod my head .
I think a few little old ladies in the airport still didn n't believe me . ''
