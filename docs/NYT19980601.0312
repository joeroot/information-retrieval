Pedro Lopez left his Bronx home in a big hurry one morning several months ago and became a medical statistic by nightfall .
Nothing happened to him ; he felt fine .
But the vials of prescription medications on the edge of his bathroom sink went unopened that morning , and again that afternoon , and then most of the rest of the week .
By the end of the month he had stopped taking them at all .
With other things on his mind , Lopez , 41 and disabled , had joined the ranks of millions of Americans who fail to take their medications as prescribed _ and who are suddenly attracting a flood of attention in the health-care world .
Study after study over the last 20 years has shown that misuse of prescription drugs is a worldwide epidemic every bit as dangerous and costly as an actual medical illness .
It was tagged `` America 's other drug problem '' in the early 1990s when researchers consistently found it responsible for 10 to 25 percent of hospital and nursing home admissions studied .
In 1984 , the National Pharmaceutical Council , an association of pharmaceutical companies , estimated that misuse of prescription drugs had caused 125,000 deaths a year from heart disease alone .
In 1993 the same organization calculated that not taking medicines correctly was draining upwards of $ 100 billion a year from the nation 's economy in direct and indirect costs .
And with increased cost consciousness has come a new appreciation of the problem of `` noncompliance , '' as medicine has labeled the phenomenon of skipping some doses , doubling up on others , forgetting to refill at the end of the month , or taking a few of a family member 's antibiotics on the chance they will work better than the ones prescribed .
Interest has been sharpened by new studies clearly demonstrating that disorders ranging from elevated blood cholesterol to asthma respond far better when patients take medications as prescribed .
And the flip side of the equation has been vividly illustrated by the medications for tuberculosis and AIDS : they may actually damage a patient 's health when taken improperly , by inducing drug-resistant disease that may be passed on to others and can not be treated at all .
In fact , improving medication-taking behavior may be one of the few arenas in health care today where widely disparate interest groups _ including medical researchers , patient advocates , drug companies , public health authorities and HMO executives _ share a goal .
The result : an outpouring of medical articles and studies on the subject and a cornucopia of new tactics , devices and programs all aiming to cajole patients like Pedro Lopez to remember their pills .
Ten years ago , his lapse might have netted him nothing more than a lecture from his frustrated doctor and a sheaf of new prescriptions .
Instead , only days after he confessed at the doctor 's office , Lopez found himself the center of a flurry of activity directed at getting him back on track .
He had a set of new medications with fewer side effects , a simplified schedule for taking them , a stack of informational brochures about them , a weekly appointment with a health educator , a little oval tag for his key chain that beeped at pill-taking time , and an account with a mail-order pharmacy that delivers his refills automatically at the end of each month .
Several weeks later Lopez said he was taking his medication more regularly .
`` People in general take about 75 percent of their medications as prescribed , '' said Joyce Cramer , a medical researcher at Yale University and an authority on drug-taking behavior .
But within that figure the range of misbehavior is wide .
Nancy Houston Miller , a nurse who is the associate director of Stanford University 's Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in Palo Alto , estimated that 10 to 20 percent of patients grossly flout medication regimens _ never filling the prescriptions or taking only a few token pills .
About 50 percent take doses more or less correctly .
And an all-important 30 percent to 40 percent in the middle are `` partial compliers , '' forgetful enough that the medication may have only a fraction of its desired effect or may actually be harming them , but well-intentioned and able to be trained .
The interplay of medications and diseases and human behavior further complicates the picture .
Some drugs are more `` forgiving '' than others , said Dr. John Urquhart , a physician and professor of pharmacoepidemiology at Maastricht University in Maastricht , the Netherlands , who is one of the world 's experts in medication-taking behavior .
The blood-pressure drug reserpine , for instance , continues to lower pressure for a full two weeks after a dose , forgiving many pill-taking lapses .
Shorter-acting medications demand better compliance to work .
And some diseases are more forgiving , too .
Patients with serious diseases who are veterans at taking medication _ cardiac-transplant patients , for instance _ are usually better pill takers than those with silent conditions like high blood pressure , Urquhart said .
But in general , predicting what patient will display which pill-taking behavior often yields surprises .
Income , education , sophistication and competence in other parts of life correlate only very poorly with pill-taking behavior , the experts agree .
People who know the purpose of the medication and the way it is supposed to work often do better than others .
But education has its definite limits in inducing good pill-taking behavior _ doctors , for example , are notoriously poor at it .
In one large study of heart-attack prevention in male doctors in the 1980s , a full 30 percent of doctors were disqualified because they proved unable to take a single pill reliably every day .
Thus , as valuable as educational brochures , package inserts and videotapes may be , they are often now supplemented with a range of new compliance tools .
Some tools are million-dollar , labor-intensive programs .
At Stanford , for instance , Ms. Miller has shown that heart-attack patients assigned to a nurse who spends hours educating them about diet , smoking , exercise and drug treatment , and then makes follow-up phone calls at home , are far more likely to stay on their medications than those who receive standard medical care .
Similarly , in New York City , a program in which city health department workers actually hand tuberculosis patients their medications every morning and watch them swallow has been credited with dramatically increasing cure rates for the disease in the last five years .
Other new gadgets encourage patients to supervise themselves .
A famous prototype for these devices was the circular container developed in the 1960s to help women remember their daily oral contraceptive pill .
Flat blister-packs of prescription medications are now widely used in Europe to serve the same purpose , Urquhart said .
At the AIDS clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital , every patient is supplied with a large rectangular pillbox whose 28 compartments can hold a week 's worth of medications to be taken several times a day , said Dr. Gerald Friedland , a professor of medicine at Yale who directs the AIDS program .
Current treatment for AIDS requires patients to take up to two dozen pills daily , often with different requirements for each , like an empty or a full stomach .
`` What 's special about HIV infection is the sheer complexity of the medications , '' Friedland said .
`` One of the definite predictors of poor adherence to treatment is the complexity of the regimen . ''
Other gadgets now on the market include simple electronic alarms that can be programmed to sound at intervals throughout the day and more sophisticated beepers that flash messages ( `` Time to take a gemfibrozil now , '' it might tell patients with heart disease ) as well .
And the newest devices entering offices and clinics can actually provide patients with little monthly medication report-cards , for both patient and doctor to inspect and try to improve .
They are pill-bottle caps fitted with a battery and a computer chip that remembers every time the bottle cap is opened and closed .
Once a month the chip 's memory can be downloaded into a computer and turned into a graph of exactly when during the month the patient dipped into the vial .
Originally developed by Urquhart at Aprex Corp. in California in the 1980s , the bottlecaps have until recently been used almost exclusively in research studies .
But the product is now making significant inroads into regular medical care .
More than 100,000 patients have been monitored with the Aprex device to date , said Janice Wohltmann , a vice president of the company .
Far more accurate than other monitoring devices like medication diaries or blood levels of drugs , the bottle caps can tell doctors if `` the drug failed the patient , or the patient failed to take the drug , '' Ms. Cramer said .
Patients are seldom aware of the extent of their missed medication doses , and , if aware , they are unlikely to share the dismal truth with the doctor .
But the information is crucial if doctors are to figure out if a patient who does not respond to a medication needs a different one , or just some help in taking the original prescription .
The bottle cap data can also be used in a kind of behavior modification system to encourage patients to stay with the treatment , she said .
Patients can see for themselves that when they take their pills properly , their blood cholesterol , or blood pressure , or blood sugar reflects the good work .
`` It 's the type of monitoring that should become very common , '' Ms. Cramer said .
`` It 's a part of a diagnostic evaluation '' _ an objective reflection of the patient 's medical condition just like a blood test .
So far no issues of privacy have surfaced in marketing the caps , she said .
Even schizophrenic patients , generally leery of surveillance devices on or near their person , have accepted the caps with equanimity , she said , and greatly improved their medication-taking abilities as a result .
Starting a medication is a little like enlisting in the army , Urquhart said .
`` You 're recruited in an office with the flags and the uniforms and you hear all about the big picture .
But then after you sign on you find yourself in boot camp '' _ and everybody needs a little help learning how to march in step .
