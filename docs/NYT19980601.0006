SCHOOL DISTRICT MATH QUIZ : WHEN SHOULD CLASSES START ?
( ATTN : N.Y . , N.J . , Conn. , Pa. ) ( bb ) By MARIA NEWMAN c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
For education officials , setting the school calendar has become as mind-boggling as solving a complex math equation .
They have to take into account religious holidays , federal holidays , contracts with teachers , family vacations and local customs .
This year , they have one more consideration : Labor Day is unusually late , falling on Sept. 7.
And the date is playing havoc with the decision on when to begin classes for the fall .
In Norwalk , Conn. , school will start Sept. 1 , a bit later than surrounding school districts , but before Labor Day , when many families are still enjoying the last of their summer vacations .
In Farmingdale , on Long Island , students will return to classes on Sept. 3 , the first time they have done so before the holiday .
In Perth Amboy , N.J . , school officials opted to convene classes on Sept. 9 , but to do away with vacation days for two Jewish holidays .
That has angered the teachers ' union , which is enlisting the help of Jewish groups and legislators to challenge the schedule .
In New York City , where the teachers ' contract says school can not start before Labor Day , classes will also begin Sept. 9.
State laws dictate the number of days children must be in school _ generally about 180 .
But in most states , local districts determine when school starts , with the decisions setting the rhythm of family life .
As officials everywhere are realizing this year , any tinkering with the first day of school affects every other holiday or day off throughout the year .
More important , the start date affects the length of the summer break , the vacation most families still care most about .
`` Every time we try something that impinges or infringes on that traditional summer family vacation , it becomes controversial , '' said Orville Ballard , a regional liaison to the State Commissioner of Education in Texas .
`` People still expect summer to be vacation time . ''
For Nancy Powers , a sales director for a medical company in Bucks County , Pa. , the decision by the Pennsbury School District to start school before Labor Day almost ruined her family 's vacation .
Ms. Powers said she and her family had paid a year in advance to rent a beach house in North Carolina this August .
But in December , she learned that the district had decided to start school on Aug. 30 , before her family was to return .
Ms. Powers said the family had trouble getting the rental agency to return the money and had to pay twice as much to rent another house a week earlier .
`` We are still going down there , and we 're going to enjoy it , but we had a traumatic change of plans for no reason at all , '' Ms. Powers said .
In Norwalk , the calendar is set two years in advance , sometimes three .
Officials there begin school before Labor Day if the holiday is late , and after if it is early .
But unlike its neighbors , Norwalk usually does not start school in August .
And the district continues to have two breaks in the spring , one in February and one in March or April .
`` We love tradition here , '' said Dr. Susan Weinberger , public affairs officer for the district .
`` Parents don n't want to lose their vacations . ''
Besides the usual holidays and family vacations that a district has to work around , setting the calendar can involve a range of other issues .
Connecticut law , for instance , says school must end by June 30 , the last day of the state 's fiscal year .
That means many districts begin classes in August .
In Perth Amboy , the worry was having enough time to prepare for the high school proficiency exam , a test on which the district has performed poorly .
Jack Roedecker , the assistant superintendent in Perth Amboy , said his district did not want to start before Labor Day and so to gain extra days decided to not close for two Jewish holidays .
That decision angered teachers , many of whom are Jewish .
Most of the students in the district are Hispanic .
`` For as long as anybody kept track of the school calendar , the Jewish holidays have always been observed here in Perth Amboy , '' said Norm Tankiewicz , the district representative for the Perth Amboy Federation / AFT , the teachers ' union .
`` We 're going to have a significant number of teachers who will be absent anyway , so it 's going to be very chaotic . ''
Around the country , districts have different starting dates : Los Angeles begins Sept. 9.
Miami starts Aug. 31 .
In Kansas City , Mo. , classes convene Sept. 1 , the first time school has started before Labor Day .
Districts that have chosen to begin school after the late holiday have had to compromise on other days off .
Most schools on Long Island will begin classes before Sept. 7.
In South Huntington , though , the board decided to begin classes after Labor Day , but to do away with part of the winter break in February .
Most parents said they preferred starting after the holiday .
`` If we had started before Labor Day , we would have had a lot of absences , '' said Irene Cruikshank , president of the Council of South Huntington PTA 's .
`` It would have been like starting school twice . ''
