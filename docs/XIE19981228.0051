BEIJING , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) today announced that its four research institutes of Mathematics , Applied Mathematics , System Sciences , and Scientific Computing will be integrated into one , under the name of the Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences .
As the largest of the CAS 's 12 pilot knowledge-innovation projects for this year , this reform is aimed at establishing a unified administration on the four institutes and introducing a modern research institute system , said Xu Zhihong , vice-president of the CAS .
" We will try to build the academy into a national innovation center of mathematics which will be on a par with the world 's best by 2005 , " said Yang Le , president of the newly-founded academy .
" To achieve this goal , we will first reach the advanced Asian level in the fields of basic and applied mathematics and system sciences , " Yang said , adding that the academy will focus on 13 major research fields , which have been recommended by the four institutes .
He said that to meet the needs of major research projects , the academy will employ 80 research professors and 100 associate research professors .
Researchers under the age of 45 will become the majority at the academy within two years .
The academy has already chosen the first group of 60 research professors from its original staff .
Yang said the academy will also increase the number of " transient researchers " including overseas visiting scholars , postgraduate students , and other scientists invited from outside the CAS , until these are as many as the permanent staff .
The Research Institute of Mathematics was founded in 1952 , and the other three institutes , which originated in the Research Institute of Mathematics , were all founded in the 1970s .
