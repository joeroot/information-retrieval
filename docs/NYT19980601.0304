JFK , TOWER AND A TALE OF SEXUAL INTRIGUE
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By RON HUTCHESON c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
WASHINGTON _ Of all the strange items in the recently released FBI files on former President John F. Kennedy , one of the strangest is a cloak-and-dagger tale involving former Sen. John Tower of Texas .
On July 29 , 1963 , Tower telephoned FBI headquarters to report what he called `` a very unusual set of circumstances . ''
The rest of the story is spelled out in an FBI memo on file in the National Archives .
About two weeks before Tower went to the FBI , his office received a series of phone calls from a New York man who identified himself as Robert Garden .
Garden said he had information regarding the `` national welfare '' that he wanted to pass on to the Republican senator .
Tower 's aides initially rebuffed Garden 's overture but finally relented after about a week of repeated phone calls .
The brief conversation persuaded Tower to send administrative assistant H. Edward Munden to meet the mysterious tipster at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York .
Garden , who identified himself as a private detective , reached into a tan briefcase and pulled out legal documents that he said `` dealt with personal matters '' involving Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy .
`` The gist of the matter appeared to concern an affair between the president and a woman and as a result of which the woman became pregnant , '' the FBI summary states .
`` Garden claimed to have compromising pictures and additional documents in safe deposit boxes in the midwest and west coast . ''
The private detective identified the woman as the widow of a top executive at the Singer Sewing Machine Co. He also told Munden that Robert Kennedy used his influence to block a lawsuit that threatened to expose the relationship .
The meeting ended when Munden told the tipster that he `` wanted nothing to do with such material . ''
The FBI was unable to verify Garden 's identity , but Hoover and his inner circle were already well aware of the allegations against the president and his brother .
About a month before Tower 's call , the FBI investigated reports that another New York private detective had tried to sell similar documents to union leader James Hoffa .
Kennedy 's alleged lover was Alicia Darr , who had worked as a prostitute in Boston and New York .
She first came to the FBI 's attention in 1961 , shortly after Kennedy 's inauguration , when she told an Italian magazine that she had been engaged to marry Kennedy in the early 1950s .
She said the engagement fizzled because Kennedy 's father objected to the union .
Darr later married British actor Edmund Purdom , but the couple divorced in 1961 .
Darr rebounded by marrying Alfred Corning Clark , an heir to the Singer fortune , a short time later .
Clark died of a heart attack less than two weeks after the wedding , leaving his new bride the bulk of his $ 10 million estate .
The resulting legal tangle was ordered sealed by a New York judge , a move that helped fuel speculation of a Kennedy cover-up .
The FBI files offer no evidence to support either the love affair or any cover-up .
Muckraking journalist Seymour Hersh also dismisses the allegations in his new book , `` The Dark Side of Camelot , '' an otherwise scathing account of Kennedy 's personal life .
Ironically , Tower later had his own experience with unproven allegations in FBI files .
In 1989 , an FBI file filled with unsubstantiated reports of womanizing and heavy drinking helped scuttle Tower 's nomination as defense secretary .
He died in a commuter plane crash two years later .
