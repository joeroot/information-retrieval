During his meeting in the Kremlin with the heads of the country 's three major television channels , Yeltsin called for " a mutually acceptable form of cooperation " and " a new understanding , " the Interfax news agency reported .
This form should include " guarantees for you on many issues , including financial ones , " he said .
" There will be no censorship , no blackmail and , God forbid , no persecution for criticism " of the state , Yeltsin said .
" The Constitution firmly and precisely stipulates freedom of speech and press , and as the guarantor of the constitution , I must ensure it , " he said .
Oleg Dobrodeyev , director General of the NTV Independent Television company , attended the Kremlin meeting .
