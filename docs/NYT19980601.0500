POLISH WRESTLER DENIED STAY OF DEPORTATION
( For use by N.Y .
Times News Service clients ) By BOB PETRIE c.1998 The Arizona Republic
( Phoenix ) - Former world-class wrestler Roman Wroclawski find s himself pinned to the bureaucratic mat _ with little chance of a reversal .
Without comment , Wroclawski 's stay of deportation to Poland was denied Monday by the Immigration and Naturalization Service .
Unless a U.S immigration judge agrees to hear Wroclawski 's case , he and his family will be shipped out of the country on June 15 to Poland , where he is accused of treason and political enemies await .
`` No explanation was given , '' said Marshall Whitehead , a Phoenix lawyer representing Wroclawski , a 1982 world Greco-Roman champion who trains wrestlers in the Valley .
`` It 's very cold and there was no effort to try to show some compassion , '' Whitehead said .
Wroclawski , who has been critical of his homeland
in a book , was ordered deported in absentia in March after failing to show for a political asylum hearing .
Though the government sent a letter to Wroclawski 's former lawyer , former Arizona Gov. Raul Castro , notifying him of the hearing , the
letter was lost after Castro signed for it .
Wroclawski , 42 , entered the country on a one-year visitor 's visa , which expired in March 1995 .
Upon hearing the ruling , Wroclawski 's children , Michalina , 16 , and Roman , 9 , began sobbing at
the INS office in downtown Phoenix .
`` It was a really emotional meeting and especially emotional for my kids , '' Wroclawski said through an interpreter .
`` For four years , they have Americanized themselves and they felt really bad . ''
Pa trick Contreras , an INS official who made the decision , declined comment .
Russell Ahr , an INS spokesman , said he could not comment specifically on Wroclawski 's case , but said Judge Dean LeVay , should he agree to open the case , would be fair and impartial toward the wrestler .
`` The outcome is not guaranteed , '' Ahr said .
Should LeVay decide to rehear the case , a decision expected later this week , Wroclawski 's family would be allowed to stay in the country .
If he doesn n't , Wroclawski could appeal to the federal courts , but would still be deported June 15 .
`` If he leaves the country , we 'd have a very difficult time appealing these things , '' Whitehead said .
Each family member would be able to leave with 60
pounds of baggage .
The rest would be shipped overseas .
In Poland , double warrants seeking Wroclawski 's arrest await .
He is accused of treason for writing the book , as well as defrauding a Polish company of about $ 300 , 000 .
Wroclawski , who first sought asylum in 1996 , said he is innocent .
Whitehead says his client , who has an offer to help coach Olympic wrestlers in Colorado Springs , deserves another chance in court .
Wroclawski 's first hearing , in mid-1997 , was suspended w hen the judge and INS officials said they wanted to read the book .
`` He 's helped the American wrestling scene and our ( the government 's ) thinking is to turn around in a cold-hearted approach and throw him out of the country without his day i n court . ''
