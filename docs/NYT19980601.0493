NASA PREPARES FOR SHUTTLE LAUNCH AS RUSSIANS FIX MIR 'S STEERING
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By MARK CARREAU c.1998 Houston Chronicle
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla. _ With some difficulty , the Russians regained steering control of their drifting Mir space station Monday , satisfying NASA that it was safe to proceed with a final U.S. shuttle visit .
The shuttle Discovery and a six-member crew were to blast off from the Kennedy Space Center at 6 : 09 p.m. , EDT , Tuesday .
Shuttle program managers planned to monitor the Russian repair effort through the night but did not slow efforts to dispatch Discovery .
U.S. astronaut Andy Thomas , who boarded Mir in late January , waited eagerly for the arrival of his ride back to Earth on Thursday .
At midday Monday , Mir cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin and their flight control team in suburban Moscow managed to restart the station 's steering system after two days of slow but uncontrolled drift .
The system constantly steers Mir so that its power generating solar arrays gather the sunlight required to generate electricity .
NASA 's experts acknowledged that the underlying cause of the steering problem had not been pinpointed , though it seemed to reside in the primary sensor that measures Mir 's turning motions .
Those rates are then transmitted to the guidance computer so that it can command the station 's turbinelike gyrodynes to move the outpost .
Initially , the Russians believed the difficulty was in the system 's software , then the guidance computer itself .
The computer was replaced by the Mir crew Sunday but balked at accepting information from the rate sensor .
Early Monday , the station crew switched the computer to a backup motion sensor and succeeded in folding in the station 's steering jets .
The Russians planned to wean the station from the jets to the gyrodynes Tuesday .
`` We have more than 24 hours to watch the attitude control system .
That will be adequate to have confidence in it , '' said Frank Culbertson , who manages NASA 's cooperative human spaceflight program with the Russians .
`` We would not rush into this .
We will launch when both the Mir and shuttle are ready and safe to go . ''
`` The situation is basically under control , there is no reason to delay , '' said Boris Sotnikov , the Russian manager for the cooperative program .
`` Rest assured , if there was any risk at all , we would definitely decide to stop the launch and wait until the situation was stable . ''
The loss of steering control is the first for the station since early January .
In 1997 , the station was rocked by a succession of major difficulties .
Those included a collision , flash fire and breakdowns of its life support systems , as well as the faltering of guidance systems blamed on aging computer components .
The recent incident has been mild in comparison .
Without steering control , Mir is technically in a tumble and in jeopardy of losing its ability to generate electrical power .
Fortunately , the tumble rate was small , about one revolution every 60 hours .
The station remained drenched in sunlight , and there was little power loss to the Mir 's life support systems .
The ordeal , however , forced the cancellation of the brief news conference NASA had planned with Thomas on the eve of the shuttle launching .
Nonetheless , Monday 's developments bolstered his spirits .
`` Let 's hope I can find my boarding pass , '' Thomas joked as he spoke with NASA colleagues at the Russian ground control facility .
`` I hope it 's around here somewhere . ''
Over the weekend , he had expressed some anxiety over how Mir 's difficulties would influence shuttle launch plans .
Thomas is the seventh and final U.S. astronaut assigned to live and work on the orbital outpost .
Discovery 's crew will deliver 3,300 pounds of food , water and other supplies to the Russians .
The shuttle astronauts plan to return to Earth with more than a ton of U.S. research equipment and worn out Russian gear .
