MEET THE POLITICAL TRENDS ON THE WAY FROM CALIFORNIA
2 TAKES ( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN c.1998 The Boston Globe
UNIVERSAL CITY , Calif. _ This is the first political primary of the 21st century .
Voters in the biggest , gaudiest , wildest state go to the polls Tuesday to select their gubernatorial candidates in the most costly , colorful , and bitter campaign of the year .
By any measure , the California race is the most important political campaign in the country this year .
The state 's annual budget is about $ 75 billion , by far the largest in the nation .
It is the only governor 's office in the eight biggest states that the Democrats have a realistic chance of capturing .
And the winner will play a major role in reapportionment in 2002 , when California , which has 52 seats in the House , may have as many as 60 _ or almost one-seventh of the entire chamber .
But the California race also is significant because , in the political as well as popular culture , California is the national pacesetter .
What happens here eventually happens everywhere .
`` From music to entertainment to the national dress code , almost all trends begin in California _ and politics is no exception , '' said US Senator Robert G. Torricelli , a New Jersey Democrat .
`` We watch it very carefully . ''
Here are the California political trends that are on display here _ and that could be coming to an election near you soon :
& UR ; 1.
Money may be the mother 's milk of politics , but it doesn n't make for the whole meal .
& LR ; One of the gubernatorial candidates , onetime Northwest Airlines cochairman Al Checchi , may spend $ 32 million before Tuesday .
He probably will come in third in the Democratic race .
Another , US Representative Jane Harman , probably will spend $ 15 million .
She is in second place .
Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis , the smallest spender at $ 8 million , is the favorite .
But the likely triumph of Davis won n't mean that money isn n't important in politics .
It is .
A 30-second ad on the television program `` ER '' in Los Angeles costs $ 55 , 000 .
Even a candidate who is badly outspent uses most of his time asking for contributions and very little speaking to voters ; Davis has had to raise about $ 35,000 a day just to remain competitive .
`` The lesson of California , '' said US Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert , who has contemplated a Republican gubernatorial campaign in New York , `` is that you want to make a contribution but you end up spending most of your time trying to get contributions . ''
That changes the rhythm of politics _ and affects the sort of people who run for office .
`` In a very highly visible race , where there aren n't many candidates , it is possible for an underfinanced candidate to win , but in a way it validates the criticism of the role of money , '' said Robert Fellmeth , director of the University of San Diego 's Center for Public Interest Law .
`` But imagine if someone who was as little known and little qualified as Al Checchi ran without his money .
He 'd have absolutely no chance . ''
Checchi almost certainly won n't win the primary , but he has shaped the character of the race more than Davis , a notion that has not gone un-noticed by political professionals elsewhere .
`` The money people can buy their way into politics , '' said US Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell , a Colorado Republican .
`` Even if they don n't win , they degrade it and pollute it . ''
& UR ; 2.
Politics is , more than ever , an insider 's game .
& LR ;
Look at the media consultants of the three Democratic candidates .
Bob Shrum , who works for Checchi , once was a partner of David Doak , who works for Davis .
Bill Carrick , who is running Harman 's media campaign , worked with Shrum on the staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy .
And all three worked on the 1988 presidential campaign of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri .
`` They may be on different sides , but they have more in common than in conflict , '' said Kam Kuwata , Harman 's campaign manager .
Media consultants are like baseball managers : They rotate with the seasons as principals in a game that is chilly if not outright frosty to outsiders .
`` They are the equivalent of the party hacks of 50 years ago , except that they make big bucks , '' said Bruce Cain , associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley .
But consulting isn n't the only closed world in California politics .
There are only about a dozen political writers who follow state politics , so it is possible to talk to all the insiders of a state of 32 million people within an hour .
& UR ; 3.
Negative ads don n't hurt only the target .
& LR ;
Checchi was competitive until he started a negative assault , first on Harman , then on Davis .
His negative commercials hurt his rivals , but in the end they hurt him even more .
`` Sometimes you have to be thankful for the mistakes your opponents make , '' Davis said in a speech here last week .
A Los Angeles Times poll shows that California registered votes , by a margin of more than four to one , believe Checchi has run the most negative campaign , followed by Harman , and then Davis .
The same poll suggests that the three Democrats will finish in reverse order , with the least negative candidate , Davis , finishing first .
