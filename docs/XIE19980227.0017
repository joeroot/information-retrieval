Implementation of Ozone Treaties Hailed as
NAIROBI , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- A senior U.N. official said the results of ozone treaties in the last 10 years had been " startlingly good " and hailed by many as " a shining example for solving other global environmental problems " .
At a press briefing here Wednesday , K.M .
Sarma , Executive Secretary of the Ozone Secretariat , noted that a total consumption of about 1.1 million tons CFCs ( chlorofluorocarbons ) in 1986 had been reduced to 160,000 tons by 1996 .
CFC is one of the Ozone Depleting Substances ( ODSs ) which are controlled by ozone treaties like the Vienna Convention for the protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer .
He said that the CFC consumption in the developed countries which stood at about one million tons in 1986 had been completely phased out .
The Montreal Protocol allowed a grace period for developing countries in implementing the control measures as more time will be needed for them to obtain and introduce alternative ODS-free technologies .
Sarma pointed out that the developing countries would begin their implementation of their control measures by July 1999 and phase-out thereafter .
According to atmospheric scientists , in Antarctic continent , massive losses of ozone ( ozone hole ) discovered in 1985 increased steadily to more than 20 million square kilometers in the early 1990s and has been varying between 20 and 25 million square kilometers since .
From August to November last year , the area of the ozone hole exceeded 24 million square kilometers , more than twice the area of Europe .
Scientists predict that " the ozone layer will begin healing only by the year 2000 and we can expect the healing to continue , if the Protocol is fully implemented . "
The full recovery of the ozone hole over Arctic will be effected by the year 2050 , they added .
The developing countries have phased out HBFCs by 1996 and are committed to phasing out CFCs , Halons and Carbon Tetrachloride by 2010 , HBFCs by 2040 , and Methyl Chloroform and Methyl Bromide by 2015 .
Talking about future challenges , Sarma noted , while the protocol has been hailed as an extraordinary success so far , there are still some challenges to be faced .
He said that the phase-out of Methyl Bromide is a difficult issue because its alternatives are less easily available .
Methyl Bromide mainly used in soil fumigation and storage is used only in a small number of countries and only for high value crops .
According to Sarma , as of February 20 , 1998 , the Vienna Convention had been ratified by 166 countries and the Montreal Protocol by 165 countries .
