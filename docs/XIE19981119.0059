UK Widow 's Pension Can Be Extended to Men
LONDON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The widows ' pension is to be extended to men in a pension system reform , British Social Security Secretary Alistair Darling announced Wednesday .
He said the move was taken after a case was submitted to the European Court of Human Rights by a widower Kevin Willis .
Willis is expected to win his claim that the current UK system discriminates against men .
Darling said the benefit changes will take place after April 2001 .
He stressed changes would apply only to people of working age who lose a spouse , and not to existing widows , widows over state pension age and war widows .
Those aged 55 or over who qualified for income support and were widowed in the five years after the changes were introduced would get support worth the same amount as the current widows ' pension .
He also said 20,000 already widowed men and their dependents would benefit from the plans .
