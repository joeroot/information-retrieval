Research : Women Play Important Role in Building
TEHRAN , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Women have played an important role in building the ancient Iranian capital of Persepolis , local newspaper Iran Daily reported on Monday .
Some 30,000 terra-cotta inscriptions unearthed in Persepolis showed that some of the worker 's groups were headed by women , the public relations department of the Cultural Heritage Organization announced on Sunday .
There was no gender difference within the working class and sometimes , women acted as the manager of a group , said Dr. Abdulmajid Arfaee , an Iranian expert .
The inscriptions also showed there was an accurate and complicated administrative system during the Archamenian period ( 6th to 4th century B.C. ) .
The inscriptions , including bills , receipts , financial and accounting reports showed that workers received wheat and barley as their wages and those women who gave birth to children also received horses and camels as special wages .
And there were regular workers on fixed salaries who were summoned from cities to work for their employers , he said .
Persepolis was built during the rein of Darius the Great ( 522 - 486 B.C. ) , but was burnt during the invasion of Alexander the Great .
