CLINTON AND GORE URGE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO USE PLAIN ENGLISH
( EDs : HEADLINE stands for GORE-ENGLISH in budgeted story ) ( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By EUN LEE KOH c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
WASHINGTON _ Plain talk in the federal bureaucracy ?
It may never happen , but the administration said Monday it 's going to try .
President Clinton ordered all executive departments and agencies to issue documents in clear English and avoid wordy technical jargon that often confuses the public .
`` By using plain language , we send a clear message about what the government is doing , what it requires and what services it offers , '' Clinton said in a memorandum to executive department heads .
The memo said that by this October simple language should be used in all new federal documents including letters , forms , notices and instructions distributed to the public .
The order also said documents created before October should be rewritten by January 2002 .
In announcing the write-clearly directive , the administration 's latest initiative in its `` reinventing government '' effort , Vice President Al Gore said , `` Clarity helps advance understanding , and understanding can help advance trust .
The point is to make sure the American people understand us . ''
He said that `` the language in some of these forms is like gobbledygook .
Most people are left confused . ''
Gore urged agencies to revise such documents as forms for tax payments , immigration and naturalization applications , and Social Security benefits by using active rather than passive voice , shorter sentences and everyday words .
Clinton 's directive also said regulations printed in the Federal Register , a daily publication that contains presidential and federal agency documents , should be rewritten by January 1999 .
Several departments and agencies have already adopted plain-English policies .
They include the Veterans Affairs Department , Securities and Exchange Commission , Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Small Business Administration .
Clinton 's write-clearly effort is the first since President Jimmy Carter urged federal agencies to simplify their documents in 1977 .
But most agencies failed to comply , according to a spokesman for the Jimmy Carter Library Center in Atlanta .
