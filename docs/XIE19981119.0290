Indonesia 's Gross Forex Reserves Up
JAKARTA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Bank Indonesia 's gross foreign exchange reserves rose by 985.3 million U.S. dollars to 22.76 billion dollars in the week ending November 13 from the previous week .
The central bank attributed the increase to the withdrawal of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) extended loan arrangement , The Jakarta Post Thursday quoted a central bank statement as saying .
Bank Indonesia said , however , that net international reserves dropped by 100,000 dollars primarily due to servicing government foreign debt and stabilizing the rupiah , the country 's currency .
The net international reserves level of 14.23 billion dollars was still above the adjusted net international reserves level of 11.26 billion dollars targeted by the IMF , the bank said .
