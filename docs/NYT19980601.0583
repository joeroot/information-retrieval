1998 , Houston Chronicle CHICAGO _ The Utah Jazz may be within sniffing distance of its first NBA title , but the Chicago Bulls sense something else in the air .
It 's the sweet smell of six-cess .
The Bulls and Michael Jordan will be gunning for their sixth NBA championship in the '90s when they take on the Jazz in the championship series starting Wednesday night at the Delta Center , a rematch of last year 's NBA Finals won by Chicago in six games .
That 's not much time for the Bulls to recover from their physically demanding battle in the Eastern Conference finals , in which they edged Indiana 88 - 83 in Game 7 on Sunday at the United Center .
Utah , meanwhile , has been sitting around since eliminating the Los Angeles Lakers on May 24 .
`` Chicago has an excellent chance of going out there and stealing one of the first two games , '' said Indiana coach Larry Bird .
`` Utah has been lying around for 10 days .
I was in that situation one time .
I think we had eight days off , and there 's no way you can stay in game shape by sitting around .
So Chicago has a great opportunity to go out there and get one early . ''
Scottie Pippen is hoping Bird is correct .
`` You look back over the season at some of the games you should have won , and it comes back to haunt you , '' the Bulls forward said .
`` We go into this next series now not having the home-court advantage .
But with all the time off Utah has had , it could work in a negative way for them . ''
Chicago coach Phil Jackson wasn n't sure how the quick turnaround will affect his team , which isn n't exactly overflowing with young players .
`` We are very curious to see how we 're going to recover , '' Jackson said .
`` We 're going to have two days off , and that 's not a lot of time .
But then again , we 're going to be playing hard , and we 're going to battle tougher , because that 's what happens when you play all the time .
`` Utah runs a great fast break , and they move the ball up and down the court quickly .
If we 're fatigued and can n't get up and down in transition , it 's going to hurt us . ''
As if anything can hurt the Bulls .
There were whispers that the Chicago dynasty was teetering on the brink , that a combination of age and the incessant talk about dismantling the team when the season ends had sapped the Bulls of their drive .
But here they are .
Again .
Michael Jordan , who registered a near triple double ( 28 points , nine rebounds and eight assists ) in the Game 7 victory over the Pacers , feels something else has been chipping away at the Bulls _ human nature .
`` When a team is trying to do something for the third time , it 's not uncommon to lose focus at certain times , '' Jordan said .
`` You have to fight yourself , basically , to excel as a team .
I think that 's the battle we deal with now .
`` Sure , it 's a great team we 're about to play against , but when you talk about a team ( the Bulls ) that has won so much , achieved so much , and an organization that has won so much , a lot of times it 's a battle against yourself .
The expectations are there , and you try to live up to those expectations .
`` So maybe you come into the situation a little cocky , with a little swagger , which you can understand , and you don n't put forth the team effort .
That 's just human nature .
That 's something that you just can n't control . ''
One thing the Bulls have pretty much been able to control through the years _ the home court _ will not be in their favor this time .
While the Bulls were busy ringing up 72 and 69 wins over the previous two championship seasons , they won just 62 games this season .
Pretty good , but not good enough .
Utah also won 62 games but swept the two meetings with the Bulls during the regular season , giving the Jazz the home-court advantage in the Finals .
Only once before during the Bulls ' championship reign , in the 1993 Finals against the Charles Barkley-led Phoenix Suns , did Chicago not have the home-court advantage .
`` That was the one year , '' Jackson said .
`` Obviously that was a unique year , because we won both of the opening games ( in Phoenix ) . ''
But Jackson and the rest of the Bulls think the Eastern Conference finals against the Pacers was a tremendous tutorial for the Jazz .
Just like Utah , Indiana loves to fast-break .
And just like Utah , the Pacers have a deep bench .
Neither Bird nor Utah 's Jerry Sloan is afraid to use his reserves .
`` Thinking about Utah , they played very well this season , '' Jackson said .
`` Their bench is very similar to Indiana 's .
I think this was a very good preparatory series for us as far as the type of matchups and the type of energy their bench gives them _ the relief they get from their bench players .
`` It 's a team that has much more poise and moxie than a lot of teams in the league because of their veterans .
The matchups are going to be very difficult for us .
( John ) Stockton and ( Karl ) Malone , obviously , and some of their players coming off the bench have played very well in the playoffs . ''
