Eds : We call your attention to a special series of articles from & UR ; The Boston Globe & LR ; that will be moving this week .
John Yemma and Daniel Golden of The Globe have examined why Harvard University , considered by many to be the world 's greatest university , is increasingly under siege .
One criticism is that the university , which has an endowment of $ 13 billion , is obsessed with making money .
Another is that Harvard 's influence has become too pervasive _ not only at the top levels of business and government in America and around the world , but also in finance , where its interests are as diverse as oil wells , women 's cosmetics , auto dealerships , luxury apartments and subsidized housing .
Harvard 's internal practices and politics are also questioned .
The power struggles , personal animosities and turf wars that are seldom seen by outsiders would be of little consequence , except that they contribute to making Harvard what many experts now say is not the place to go for an undergraduate education that emphasizes intimate scholarly contact , risk-taking , and intuitive thinking .
The four-part series ( with one or more sidebars accompanying parts one , two and three ) will be moving on Wednesday .
The articles are available for use upon receipt .
For questions or repeats , call Al Simons at The Globe : 617 - 929-2597 .
Graphics and photos are being sent to NYT clients .
Non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling 212 - 556-4204 or - 1927 .
