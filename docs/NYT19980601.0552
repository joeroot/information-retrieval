LOOKING PAST FRANCE TO PROJECT 2010
( ATTN . : Fla. ) ( ja ) By JACK BELL c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
Alan Rothenberg , the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation , caused a bit of a stir last week when he said he did not expect the United States national team to advance past the first round of the World Cup .
Rothenberg 's comments came during a news conference to announce the ambitious Player Development Opportunity as part of the federation 's Project 2010 .
That 's 2010 , as in the year the United States would ( hopes to , expects to ) win the World Cup .
The objective , Rothenberg said , is to identify and then train players at a younger age , providing the educational and financial support that will get the best players to skip college ( even leave high school ) to play professionally .
With financial backing of more than $ 50 million from Nike and the International Management Group , the federation hopes to house up to 120 players full time in the under-17 group , initially , at the Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton , Fla.
Developing soccer players in the United States has always been a bit serendipitous , and there are no guarantees of world-class talent emerging even though millions of children are playing the game .
What 's more , unlike the rest of the world , the best athletes in America are far more interested in the big-money sports , like basketball , baseball and football .
Around the world , the biggest , strongest and fastest athletes in most countries play soccer first .
Not here .
Too much competition from other sports .
In the rest of the world , soccer is to the poor and working classes what basketball is to minority youths in this country _ a relatively inexpensive sport that offers a chance , albeit remote , at stardom .
`` Somewhere out there we 've got a 9-year-old Ronaldo , and we 've got to find him , '' Rothenberg said .
That 9-year-old Ronaldo might be out there , but he might not want to devote himself to soccer .
The players on the U.S. team going to France for the World Cup finals are world-class soccer players , but how many have been developed in the current system ?
World Cup
Much was written the past couple of weeks about the naturalization of David Regis , a Frenchman who plays in Germany , married an American and is now going to play for the United States in France .
Consider the case of two Brazilians .
Wagner Lopes is now a Japanese citizen and will play for Japan in France .
Jose Clayton last week was declared a citizen of Tunisia after government officials there waived the five-year residency rule .
`` I didn n't know anything about Tunisian football , '' Clayton told Reuters .
`` But my agent said ` It 's like Brazil : the beach and sun . '' '
Crisis Time I : Coach Bora Milutinovic and Nigeria .
The Nigerians were beaten by Yugoslavia , 3 - 0 , on Friday , but more important , the team that some people believe could do well in France will have to play with a second-string goalie .
Nigeria 's starter , veteran Peter Rufai , is hurt and is not expected to play .
His replacement , Abiodun Baruwa , looked unpolished and played poorly against Yugoslavia .
Crisis Time II : Mexico .
The perennial regional power again looks as if it is about to fall flat in the World Cup finals .
Last week , Mexico lost 4 - 1 to the German Bundesliga club Wolfsburg .
The loss comes on the heels of a 5 - 2 drubbing by Norway .
One Mexican newspaper , Reforma , called the exhibition against Wolfsburg `` pathetic . ''
Shaun Bartlett , a former player for the MetroStars , was named to the South African roster for the finals .
All 32 teams must submit their final 22-man rosters for the finals to FIFA Tuesday .
Major League Soccer
Four Los Angeles Galaxy players have scored more goals ( 29 ) than all except one _ D.C. United _ of the other Major League Soccer clubs .
Welton leads the league in scoring with 10 goals and six assists for 26 points .
Second on the list is Cobi Jones with 8 goals and seven assists .
Mauricio Cienfuegos has six goals and four assists and Martin Machon has five goals and five assists .
On Saturday , Los Angeles lost its first game at home , 2 - 1 , in the shootout to Chicago .
The Galaxy also lost for the first time in 27 games after leading at halftime .
In Denver on Sunday , Ross Paule scored the two fastest goals by one player in the league 's three-year history as Colorado beat Kansas City , 2 - 1.
Paule scored in the fifth and sixth minutes to break the record of two goals in a two-minute span held by three players .
Paule netted the first goal from 18 yards out on a chip shot and he put home the rebound of a shot by Jason Boyce one minute later .
The MetroStars ' shootout victory against New England on Sunday was the first time the MetroStars have won at Foxboro Stadium in three attempts .
It 's also only the second time in team history that the MetroStars have been over the . 500 mark .
According to figures from the league , the number of shootouts this season is down slightly .
In 66 games so far , there have been shootouts ( 12 in all ) in 18.2 percent of the matches .
That compares with 33 shootouts , representing 20.6 percent of matches , in 1997 and 34 shootouts , accounting for 21.2 percent of the matches , in 1996 .
