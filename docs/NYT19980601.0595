PORT ST .
LUCIE , Fla. _ The New York Mets outfielder who denied to police he was too drunk to drive in March , pleaded no contest Monday to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence .
St. Lucie County Judge Dan Vaughn sentenced Bernard Gilkey , 31 , to a year of probation and 50 hours of community service .
His license was suspended for six months and he must attend DUI classes and pay $ 250 plus court costs .
Gilkey was not in court when his attorney , Richard Kibbey , entered the plea .
Kibbey said his client decided to plea no contest to the charges because there was no videotape of his arrest , meaning the case would boil down to his word against that of the two police officers .
He also didn n't want to interrupt his ball playing for a trial .
`` He 's having a phenomenal season right now , '' Kibbey said .
`` He wants to focus his energies towards what he does best . ''
Addressing reporters soon after his arrest , Gilkey said he 'd had `` a couple of beers '' on his way home but denied his driving was impaired .
He was unavailable for comment Monday .
`` The point I want to make , yes , I did make a mistake , and the mistake probably , most definitely , was driving after having a couple of beers , '' Gilkey said at the time .
Prosecutors dropped a charge of driving with license suspended .
A charge of failing to drive within a single lane was dismissed .
On March 3 Port St. Lucie , Fla. police pulled over Gilkey 's leased 1998 Cadillac at 1 : 30 a.m. _ half an hour past his curfew .
Police said the ballplayer was driving westbound at about 55 mph on Port St. Lucie Boulevard , where the limit is 40 mph .
Gilkey slammed on his brakes and had to swerve to avoid a concrete median when officers behind him turned on their blue lights , they said .
Sgt. Mike Maycen wrote in his report that Gilkey smelled like alcohol and `` seemed to be confused '' when Maycen pulled him over .
