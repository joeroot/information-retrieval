Talks on Congo ( K ) to Be Held in Botswana
JOHANNESBURG , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The United Nations , the Organization of African Unity and the Southern African Development Community will hold talks in Gaborone , Botswana Friday trying to secure a cease-fire in Democratic Congo .
The rebels fighting to overthrow the government of President Laurent Kabila will be allowed to attend the meeting , South African television , SABC , reported Wednesday night .
Previously the rebels have only been consulted on the sidelines at such talks as Kabila 's government refused to have direct talks with them .
The meeting is being seen as a prelude to a peace summit to be held in South Africa early next month , SABC said .
A SADC peace summit held in Pretoria in late August called for an immediate troop standstill and cease-fire in Congo ( K ) , but a cease-fire has never been achieved .
At present , Zimbabwe , Angola , Namibia and Chad have sent troops to fight on Kabila 's side to help suppress the rebels who are being backed by Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers .
As more countries were directly involved in the war , which started on August 2 , situation in the central African country has become all the more complicated .
