Former Tehran Mayor Summoned to Face Verdict
TEHRAN , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Iran 's conservative judiciary has summoned former Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi to face the court ruling against him , a local daily Iran reported on Monday .
The summon was delivered to Karbaschi 's home by a judicial official on Sunday , the daily said .
The former mayor must introduce himself to the relevant judicial body within three days , otherwise he will be put into prison .
An appeals court in Tehran issued the verdict against Karbaschi on Thursday , reducing his sentence terms from five years to two years and the period he is banned from taking public office from 20 years to 10 years .
Karbaschi , publicly tried on charges of graft , was sentenced five years in prison , a 20-year ban from holding government posts , 60 lashes of the whip and a fine of one billion rials ( about 160,000 U.S. dollars ) in July .
The appeals court also changed his lashing sentence to a cash fine of 10 million rials ( about 1,600 dollars ) , but it insisted on a fine of one billion rials and ordered him to return 600 million rials ( about 100,000 dollars ) to the public coffers .
Karbaschi 's lawyer has filed a protest to the judiciary calling for forming a public court to reconsider the case , the daily said .
The mayor , a well-known reformist and a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami , has been a target of hard-line political rivals who control the country 's judiciary .
Karbaschi was temporarily jailed in April , but was released under an order from the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei after political disturbance occurred in the country following his arrest .
