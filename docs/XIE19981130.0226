Scottish Scientist May Be First to Clone Human Embryo
LONDON , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- A Scottish scientist is on the brink of making medical history by becoming the first person to clone a human embryo , The Sunday Times reported Sunday .
Dr Austin Smith , director of Edinburgh University 's center of genome research , is expected to pioneer a revolutionary form of cloning by giving every baby an embryonic " twin , " from whom spare body parts can be grown and life-threatening diseases treated .
He is in consultation with the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh which created Dolly , the first cloned mammal , and said that within the next 12 years it would be routine for every baby to have an embryonic clone .
" All it takes now is financial investment , " he said .
" This therapy will be the medicine of the next century . "
A working party from Britain 's Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority and the human genetics advisory commission will report to the government within the next few weeks .
It is understood that it will recommend approval of new " therapeutic " cloning but come down firmly against reproductive cloning by replicating a living human being .
If the group 's report is accepted by ministers , it would mean that Britain could be the first to clone a human embryo , The Sunday Times said .
