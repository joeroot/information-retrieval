Nigeria Labor Congress Issues Ultimatum over Oil
LAGOS , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress ( NLC ) has issued a 12-day ultimatum to the government to reverse the recent pump price increase of petroleum products or face the wrath of workers nationwide .
In a communique issued at the end of an emergency meeting to discuss the oil price increase , the NLC said Wednesday that if the situation is not reversed by January 4 , 1999 , " congress will not be in a position to guarantee Nigerian workers ' reaction thereafter " , the Post Express reported Thursday .
Following last week 's proposed deregulation of the price of petroleum products by the Nigerian government , petroleum products marketers increased at the weekend the official pump price of petroleum from 11 Naira ( about 0.13 U.S. Dollar ) to 24 Naira per liter .
The decision to increase oil price , the NLC noted , portends a " hidden agenda and a deliberate attempt by the government to create the objective conditions for perpetuation of this regime or another military intervention in the event of mass protests against the increase . "
The Nigerian government relied on the economically irrational arguments of the need to stem smuggling and prevent scarcity of oil supply over the past two years by increasing price , the NLC pointed out .
However , the congress explained that the recent price increase would not end scarcity and smuggling but would only enrich a few Nigerians .
