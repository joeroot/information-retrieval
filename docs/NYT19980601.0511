( For use by clients of the New York Times News Service ) Networking for Profits By Jonathan Marshall c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle Monica Frei , head of a Bay Area nanny placement service , had all the people skills she needed to spot a good housekeeper , nanny or personal assistant .
But until recently she was almost too petrified even to touch a computer .
That all changed last year when associates finally convinced her to install a computer network in the three Bay Area offices of Town and Country Nannies and Mothers In Deed .
By themselves , the firm 's computers weren n't any friendlier than before , but networked together they became too powerful a business tool for Frei to ignore .
The network has made `` a huge , huge difference to our business , '' Frei enthused , noting that employees now share files and communicate far more effectively between offices .
`` Our efficiency and thoroughness have increased dramatically . ''
Small businesses all over America are discovering similar benefits from letting their computers communicate together .
A computer network lets employees swap files with the push of a button instead of walking from room to room with floppy disks .
It lets them share a high-speed printer instead of wasting desk space and money putting printers by every workstation .
And it permits everyone in the office to share Internet access without the expense of multiple dial-up lines and accounts .
Networks also let offices centralize files on one hard disk , so safety backups become easy and routine rather than onerous and infrequent .
The message hasn n't sunk in everywhere .
Eighty percent of America 's 7 million small businesses ( those with formal offices and fewer than 100 employees ) have computers , but only about a quarter have a computer network , according to International Data Corp. , a market research firm .
Many more would take the plunge if they listened to Frei .
Until last year , her employees had computers but mostly relied on paper files .
If a client came to the Larkspur office seeking a nanny whose file was in San Francisco , the offices wound up faxing piles of paperwork back and forth .
And when new references came in on a prospective housekeeper or nanny , or a placement worker got important leads on new clients , word didn n't always get out to employees in other offices .
With much apprehension about cost and complexity , Frei finally gave the green light to the installation of a computer network last year .
Now all 25 staffers in Palo Alto , San Francisco and Larkspur can call up files and communicate with each other instantly by interoffice data links .
When one employee updates a nanny 's file , the new information is instantly available on a central computer , called a server , to everyone in the company .
E-mail messages now pass important tips to the entire staff without delay .
And the offices can now communicate via the Internet more readily with clients in the technology industry , for whom e-mail is second nature .
Employees can also work from home or on the road by dialing into the office network to retrieve files from the server .
`` I 'm expecting my first baby in September , and I 'm excited to know it 's possible to work from home , '' Frei said .
Between the three offices , the network hardware and installation cost about $ 12 , 000 , including a new server .
Frei said it `` has already paid for itself ten-fold in the amount of time we save and the things we don n't miss by communicating efficiently .
Even the tiniest offices can benefit from networks .
Based in San Rafael , the U.S. subsidiary of Novacart , an Italian maker of baking molds , linked together its two computers at the beginning of the year and has already reaped big rewards .
Joe Miglia , head of the office , said his desk used to be covered with paper jottings about possible customer leads and where to send samples .
When he did use his computer to produce a document , he had to detach the printer from his assistant Sarah Eitel 's computer , a messy process .
`` It was a disaster , '' he said .
Then he hired a consultant to network the computers together .
Printing is now automatic .
He and Eitel share files instantly , so they can keep track of customer inquiries on a single computer database .
`` Now if Joe 's bakery calls up , I know if they already talked to her , '' Miglia said .
The database also reminds him when to follow up sample shipments with sales calls to customers , a process that used to be haphazard at best .
`` Our productivity is way up , '' Miglia said .
`` I tell Sarah almost once a week , God , this system is great . ''
Networks become even more essential as a business grows .
Tom Pelton discovered that last year as he added employees to Micro-Metric , a San Jose firm that makes precise measurement equipment for makers of hard disks and semiconductors .
When Pelton worked out of a garage and handled sales and accounting himself , he didn n't need a network .
But , recently , he hired a bookkeeper , office manager , purchasing agent and three programmers who need to work on common files .
The only practical solution was to put files on a central server and share them over the network .
Pelton hired T&AMP ; R Communications in Milpitas to install the network last year for under $ 15 , 000 , including three computers , an uninterruptible power supply and other equipment and support .
Today he can n't imagine living without it .
`` Most of the time you aren n't aware that it 's there , '' Pelton said .
`` But without it , I 'd have a mutiny . ''
After Pelton installed the network , he soon discovered another big advantage : the ease of backing up files off a single server rather than many separate computers .
`` In the old days , each person was responsible for his own backups , '' Pelton said .
`` If I didn n't back up or my secretary didn n't or a programmer didn n't , we were in a hurtin ' way .
Now every night we have a tape drive that sucks everything up off the server .
A month ago the hard drive on my computer crashed completely .
At first , I was blown away .
Then I realized everything I care about is backed up on the network ( server ) . ''
To install networks without costly interruptions to their business , many small firms rely on consultants .
Owners should pick consultants with care , relying on personal recommendations from satisfied customers , said Michael Boorstein , a Marin-based network consultant .
`` Many consultants are hanging out shingles these days with no experience , '' he said .
`` They hooked up two computers at home and found it was easy , then get out into the real world and find bazillions of problems . ''
Consultants typically charge anywhere from $ 80 to $ 125 an hour .
But jobs often take only a few hours .
Boorstein got a network of 12 Pentium computers up and running at Spirit Rock meditation center in Marin in just four hours .
( The center already had network wiring in place . )
Relatively simple networks of that size can often be installed by computer-savvy business owners or employees without the help of a consultant .
`` It 's definitely not rocket science anymore , '' said Jim Novack , a Larkspur-based computer consultant .
`` It 's almost as simple as plugging your telephone into a socket . ''
