Government Departments Join Computer Network
BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese government departments at all levels plan to establish public information web sites which list pertinent information and services , according to a recent issue of Guangzhou Daily .
Some 100 government departments have already established web sites , and additional departments are expected to follow suit during 1999 , according to a survey of 72 ministries and departments under the State Council .
Government departments have assumed control of over 80 percent of important information sources and more than 3,000 data banks , but have not as yet been able to take full advantage of the system due to inefficient communication channels .
The web sites will provide a new window enabling government offices to better serve the public and lead to the full realization of " government computerization " .
