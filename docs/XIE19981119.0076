Canada 's Inflation Edges Up in October
OTTAWA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Inflation in Canada edged up 0.4 percent in October as consumers paid more for gasoline , electricity and fresh vegetables , Statistics Canada said Thursday .
In October , gasoline prices rose 2.2 percent over September , electricity was up 2.3 point and fresh vegetables 6.7 percent .
In the meantime , prices for furniture and meat fell , which largely moderated the overall increase on the inflation rate .
On a yearly basis , Canada 's inflation rate rose one percent in October .
" Prices for gasoline and computer equipment continued to exercise major downward pressure on the annual change , while prices for food , university tuition , piped gas and property taxes were the major contributors to the upward movement , " the agency said .
Since the beginning of this year , Canada 's annual inflation rate has ranged from a low of 0.7 percent in September to a high of 1.1 percent in January and May , well below the the annual average change of 1.6 percent in both 1997 and 1996 .
