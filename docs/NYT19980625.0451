FOLEY MAKES NICE TO JETS ' NEWEST QUARTERBACK

CLIFTON , N.J .
_ After Glenn Foley learned he had been anointed _ or at least given the `` benefit of the doubt '' in Coach Bill Parcell 's words _ as the Jets ' starting quarterback , he made sure to talk to the newest Jet , Vinny Testaverde .
`` I went over things with Vinny , '' Foley said Thursday .
`` You 've got to go out of your way when you 're a quarterback to make sure things are right . ''
Foley was given the inside post for the position after Parcells ' dramatic decision to drop Neil O ' Donnell and hire Testaverde , the 34-year-old free agent whose performance has actually improved over the last five years .
`` I 've talked to some of the fellows on the team , '' Foley said .
`` It 'll be great playing with Vinny . ''
Foley , O ' Donnell and Testaverde shared a golf course and locker room again Thursday in the players ' phase of the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic , which starts Friday .
`` Hey , Neil , what 's up ? ''
Foley asked as O ' Donnell passed him in the locker room .
Foley said it was important to spell out the situation between the Jet quarterbacks .
`` I 've always gotten along well with everyone , '' he said .
`` That 's very important . ''
When Foley arrived as the Jets ' final draft pick in 1994 , he beat out Jeff Blake as the bench-warming quarterback .
Boomer Esiason was in charge .
Then two years later the Jets made their $ 25 million deal with O ' Donnell and Foley was still grounded .
Last season he came into his own only to see his season end with a knee injury once he had replaced O ' Donnell .
So is Foley excited now that he has the starter 's role ?
`` I 'm always excited , especially now that I 'm in the hunt , '' he said .
Foley reflected on his two serious injuries , the first was a dislocated shoulder in 1995 .
`` I just seem to get my head above water , '' he said .
`` You scratch and claw and eventually you 'll find land . ''
Testaverde knows about scratching and clawing , too .
He spent his first six seasons in Tampa Bay and those years still haunt him in the public 's mind , he said .
`` I 've been knocked down a lot in my life , '' Testaverde said .
`` You have to have the courage to stand back up and come back swinging . ''
It still bothers him , the quarterback admitted , that in radio interviews his interceptions are brought up .
In his career with the Buccaneers , the Browns and the Ravens , he has been intercepted 183 times while throwing 175 touchdowns .
`` A lot of that has to do when I was playing with Tampa , '' he said .
`` Look at the numbers from when I was in Tampa and wipe the slate clean from there and you 're going to see much better numbers . ''
Testaverde has a point .
Since leaving Tampa Bay , he has thrown 98 touchdowns to 71 interceptions .
He also makes yardage when he runs and doesn n't readily fumble .
`` I survived Tampa , '' he said .
`` I think I can survive most anything . ''
And O ' Donnell on the day after ?
His agent , Leigh Steinberg , is exploring possibilities with half a dozen teams .
O ' Donnell calls him constantly to find what is going on .
O ' Donnell said he wants to be a starter , but would consider a backup role .
`` Just give me the opportunity , '' he said .
`` That 's all I 'm asking . ''
