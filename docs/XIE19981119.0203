Iran to Set up Body Organs Bank
TEHRAN , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- A body organs bank is to be set up in Iran to meet the need of organs transplants , head of Iran 's Charity Foundation for Special Diseases ( CFSD ) Fatemeh Hashemi has announced .
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA , Hashemi said that her foundation is going through the preliminary stages of the project , including compiling information from the people in need of body organs and volunteers for donating organs .
" The bank will continuously be in touch with the hospitals to learn of the cases of brain-death and thus to arrange for timely performance of organ transplants , " she said .
Hashemi said that the practice of obtaining organs from a brain-dead body for transplants started in Iran in 1993 .
However , body transplants has not become a widely used practice in the country and there is no particular organization in charge of the issue , she said .
Hashemi also announced that a seminar on " Brain-death and Organ Transplants " will be held here next week to discuss the subject from religious , legal , practical and medical point of views .
The seminar is to arrive at practical guidelines for organ donations and transplants , which have been authorized by the country 's religious leaders , she said .
Hashemi said her foundation is seeking laws to govern organ donations and transplants in the country and to that end , it is preparing proposals on the subject for submission to the medical committee of the Majlis , or parliament , for approval .
She also highlighted the need for an education program to inform the public of the definition of brain-death and to get home the message that in case of a brain-death , decided by a team of medical experts , there is no more hope of life .
Meanwhile , secretary of the foundation Baqer Larijani said that the common practice of receiving hearts , kidneys and livers from living individuals has not been enough to address all the organ needs in the country .
To cover all the people in need of organ transplants , he said , receiving organs from the dead should also become a common practice .
The CFSD is currently extending services to people suffering from hemophilia , thalassemia and kidney diseases , IRNA said .
The foundation last year arranged for 1,150 cases of kidney transplants in the country and the number is expected to reach 1,300 this year .
