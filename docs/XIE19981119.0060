Turkish PM Urges Italy to Extradite PKK Leader
ANKARA , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz Wednesday called on Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan , leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party ( PKK ) , to Turkey for trial , Anatolia News Agency reported .
Addressing the parliament deputies , Yilmaz said that the Italian government would defame the country 's history if it refuses to extradite Ocalan to Ankara .
" On behalf of all political parties represented in the Parliament , I declare to the whole world that no Turkish government , even those that succeed us , will ever let Italy 's mistaken attitude stand without any response , " Yilmaz said .
He did not clarify what kind of response Turkey might make .
" We only wish good luck to our Italian allies in the tough and historic test it will have to pass , " he added .
The Turkish prime minister stressed that Turkey 's demands for extradition do not originate from a thirst for vengeance , but from its determination to punish a criminal who has acted against humanity .
Ocalan was arrested last Thursday by the Italian police for holding a forged passport when he arrived in Rome by a Russian airliner .
Turkish Foreign Ministry demanded that Italy extradite him to Turkey , saying that any action trying to block the extradition will harm the friendly ties between the two countries .
Italy , however , has not given Ankara any clear and positive response .
It is believed that the Italian government fears that Ocalan might be sentenced to death by the Turkish court because of the facts that the PKK killed large numbers of Turkish soldiers and civilians .
Turkish Justice Ministry has said that Ocalan would not be executed if he stands trial in a court , saying that it is preparing a motion to ask the parliament to abolish capital punishment from the criminal law .
But this also failed to talk the Italian government into making a decision on the extradition of Ocalan .
" There are no positive signals coming from the Italian officials , " Turkish Ambassador to Rome Inal Batu said after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D ' Alema .
D ' Alema expressed the hope that Turkey will understand Italy 's position and the Italian-Turkish relations will not be undermined .
The PKK has been fighting against the Turkish government since 1984 in an attempt to establish an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey .
Nearly 37,000 people , including soldiers , rebels and civilians , were killed during the armed conflict between the Turkish troops and the PKK militants .
