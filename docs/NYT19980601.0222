A TIP FOR NEW YORK CABBIES : GET SOME MANNERS
Commentary ( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By HARRY ROSENFELD c.1998 Albany Times Union
ALBANY , N.Y .
_ New York City 's 44,000 taxicab drivers are under fire as an industry for driving recklessly and behaving crudely to their passengers and pedestrians .
Most of the drivers _ some estimate 90 percent _ are immigrants , mostly from South Asia , but also from the Caribbean and Latin America .
They came to the United States seeking a chance for a better life than it was possible for them to have in their native countries , as had so many immigrants before them .
And , as for many immigrants , the streets and buildings of New York City are where they begin their `` pursuit of happiness '' on the lowest rungs of the American economic ladder .
When immigrants try to make it in America , they almost always have a hard time , doing the sort of jobs that those already on the premises regard as beneath them .
Today 's immigrants are no different .
The cabbies among them quickly discover that driving in New York City is a hard way to earn a living .
Also dangerous .
Drivers are easy prey for petty criminals trying to pick up easy money , thieves who often don n't limit themselves to stealing , but can be viciously violent .
But in recent years , as the crackdown on criminals produced measurable success , the peril to pedestrians and taxi passengers has increased dramatically as traffic accidents involving taxis escalated 40 percent between 1990 and 1996 .
That 's not real news to any one who has taken a cab in Manhattan recently .
With few exceptions , a taxi ride there has become an unpleasant , breath-holding exercise to see whether you will actually arrive at your destination undented and unharmed .
Cabs hurtle past one another , avoiding collisions , if they do avoid them , by millimeters .
They intimidate other drivers , especially the poor civilians among them who ought to know just how perilous it is to try to share street space with rambunctious truckers and cabbies .
Now cabbies in Manhattan traditionally have never been retiring types , neither in their driving nor their vocabulary .
So today 's drivers have a well-established base upon which to enlarge their incivilities .
Without question , taking a cab is a cruder experience today than it used to be .
In my last three dozen or so Manhattan cab rides , I can not recollect one `` thank you '' for a fine tip .
You can n't make the argument that this behavior reflects a language problem , because expressing thanks is not a matter of linguistic ability but of cultural values .
Sometimes cab drivers claim they don n't know the way to where you want to go _ one Israeli cabbie in Midtown said he did not know how to get to the Waldorf _ often , apparently , because they do not deem the destination would be rewarding enough for them .
Others have fits of annoyance when , luggage in hand , you turn out to be a fare for the nearby railroad station rather than the distant airport .
They make their passengers fully aware with boorish remarks of their discontent , although they are obliged by law to take you where you want to go .
Taxis are a licensed public service properly subjected to regulation and close monitoring .
Reckless driving , smoking on the job , arrogant behavior and rudeness are not civil rights , but are rightly controlled by supervising authorities .
Union representatives of the cabbies and some academic analysts attribute the unacceptable behavior to how money made from driving taxis is divided between owners of the cars and the people who drive them .
The drivers are under unrelenting pressure to make the $ 120 or so they have to pay to rent the cab for a 12-hour shift before they see any returns for themselves , usually ranging between $ 60 and $ 80 a shift .
Drivers complain of passengers who demand greater speed , although personally I have yet to meet such a person .
Other cabbies say they lead a dreadful life , not having the chance for timely access to restrooms .
Those problems should be addressed through the licensing procedures in the same way that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has gotten important reforms on liability insurance and raising the amount of fines cabbies face for improper driving .
There are many rights and wrongs to sort out in the clashing contentions between drivers and owners , and between the $ 1.5 billion industry and the regulators .
However , those issues remain to be resolved , the riding public deserves to get safe service , accompanied by professionally correct manners , for which they pay a substantial fare .
