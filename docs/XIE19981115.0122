Ready for Talks With Rebels : President
COLOMBO , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga has reiterated that her government was prepared for talks with the Tamil rebels , the Sunday Observer reported Sunday .
The talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) were within a stipulated time-frame and irrespective of a cease-fire , Kumaratunga told senior members of the Tamil United Liberation Front ( TULF ) during a meeting here Friday , a TULF spokesman said .
" The government believes in a negotiated political settlement for the ethnic crisis .
But we can not rush to talks with the LTTE .
We are prepared to talk to them within a stipulated time-frame and then decide on the cease-fire depending on the progress of the talks , " the president was quoted as saying .
Shortly after coming to power in 1994 , the government opened talks with the LTTE , but in April 1995 the LTTE abruptly pulled out to resume their protracted campaign for an independent homeland in the island country .
The LTTE has been waging a war against the Sri Lankan government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country .
