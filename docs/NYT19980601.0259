SIGHTLESS MAN TAKES A DIVE AT 10,000 FEET
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By LORENA FIGUEROA c.1998 San Antonio Express-News
SAN ANTONIO _ Robert Dittman knows no boundaries .
Blind since birth , the Civil Air Patrol communications officer stationed at Randolph Air Force Base had no problems leaping from a plane flying at 10,000 feet Friday afternoon .
With an Air Force flight suit on , Dittman had a 35-second free fall at 125 mph before jump master Rick Meyers of Skydive San Antonio Inc. opened the main parachute .
`` I just want to prove to people there are no limits , whether they are disabled or not , '' Dittman , 20 , said .
`` It is very depressing when people become handicapped and just sit around not doing anything , '' he said .
`` I want to inspire people to set a goal like I have done . ''
Dittman , a sophomore at the University of Texas at San Antonio majoring in radio , television and film , decided to skydive just three days before his jump .
`` I became bored on Tuesday and I decided to do something exciting , like skydiving , '' said Dittman , who hopes the Civil Air Patrol will give him his wings for the accomplishment .
The Civil Air Patrol is a volunteer organization that assists in air search and rescue missions and air crashes .
Friends who accompanied Dittman to the airfield say he is adventurous .
`` It is normal for Rob to do crazy things , '' said Victoria Archur , who read the liability forms to him before his jump .
`` Motivation is his favorite word , '' Archur said .
Meyers guided and shared a square parachute with Dittman throughout the jump .
Dittman , who didn n't tell his parents beforehand , said he wanted to skydive again .
`` It felt great ; it was the coolest feeling , '' he said .
`` I shut my eyes for a second , but then again , I can n't see . ''
