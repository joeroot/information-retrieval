Liberia Apologizes for Shooting at U.S. Embassy
NAIROBI , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Liberia formally apologized to Washington for the shooting by its security forces at the U.S. embassy in Liberian capital Monrovia , Panafrican News Agency ( PANA ) reported Saturday .
Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan said in a statement Saturday that the government of President Charles Taylor extended the apology Friday in a diplomatic note to the U.S. State Department .
The shooting on September 19 killed two Liberians and wounded two Americans .
Captan said that the Liberian government " acknowledges with regrets the wounding of two American citizens in the incident and accepts responsibility for not preventing the armed rebels from approaching the U.S. embassy . "
He added that " Liberia cherishes the cordial relations between it and the United States and would do everything to maintain these ties . "
The apology followed nearly eight weeks of denial by the Liberian government that its security forces shot at the U.S. embassy , and hence refused to apologize as requested by Washington .
Relations between Washington and Monrovia have remained cool since the U.S. accused Liberian security forces of the shooting inside the embassy compound in violation of the Vienna Convention which provides for the protection of foreign embassies .
The Liberian security forces shot in the embassy while pursuing former faction leader Roosevelt Johnson , who sought refuge within the premises of the mission following two days of bloody street gunbattle between the forces loyal to Johnson and the government troops .
More than 50 people , most of them Johnson 's men , were killed , and 49 others wounded in the gunbattle .
Johnson and 31 others were later charged with treason for plotting to topple Taylor .
