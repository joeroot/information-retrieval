JERUSALEM -- Three Israeli soldiers were killed and three others wounded Thursday in South Lebanon by Hezbollah ( Party of God ) forces , Israel Radio reported Friday .
The delay of the announcement was due to Israel 's military censorship which bans publicizing news of military casualties until the families of the victimized soldiers are informed .
The incident occurred Thursday afternoon when a long-range mortar shell fired by Hezbollah directly hit the Karkum outpost in the western sector of Israeli-declared South Lebanon Security Zone , the report said .
