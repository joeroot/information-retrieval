UNSCOM Chairman Welcomes Deal Between U.N. Chief , Iraq
UNITED NATIONS , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Richard Butler Thursday welcomed the Memorandum of Understanding between the U.N. chief and Iraq and viewed it as strengthening the work of the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) .
Speaking to reporters , the executive chairman of the UNSCOM in charge of dismantling weapons of mass destruction in Iraq said , " The Memorandum of Understanding between U.N. Secretary-General and Iraq was done at a very high political level and any reading of ignoring this would make a serious mistake . "
" At that high political level , it gave us the expression of the fundamental commitment that is set forth in the resolutions of the Security Council .
That is UNSCOM must have immediate , unconditional and unrestricted access to all sites in Iraq for the purpose of carrying out its mandate .
The Memorandum of Understanding reaffirms and reiterates that commitment , " he said .
" As far as I am concerned , I welcome it and view it as strengthening UNSCOM in the conduct of its work in Iraq .
I want to make clear that those arrangements entirely satisfied me and the organization I lead .
That will give us access to presidential sites in Iraq which are now described accurately as the consequences of the work of the U.N. mapping team , " he added .
