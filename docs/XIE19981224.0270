Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed in S. Lebanon
BEIRUT , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- A member of Israeli allied South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) was killed on Wednesday in south Lebanon by a roadside bomb , the Orient radio reported .
Security sources said that the militiaman was killed when he was walking near his house in Anan village inside Jezzine , an area policed by SLA just outside the Israeli occupied border enclave in south Lebanon .
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah , or Party of God , later claimed the responsibility for the attack .
The incident came one day after eight Lebanese civilians , including a monther and her six children , were killed by Israeli air raids on east Lebanon 's Baalbek city .
Early this morning , Hezbollah fired more than 30 Katyusha rockets at northern Israel in retaliation , wounding at least 13 Israelis .
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas .
Spearheaded by Hezbollah , Lebanon 's resistance movement has been fighting against Israeli occupying forces and its proxy SLA .
Since the start of this year , 23 Israeli soldiers and 33 SLA militiamen have been killed in conflicts with Lebanese guerrillas in the border zone .
