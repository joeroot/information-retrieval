CLINTON-PRIVILEGE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton 's decision to limit his legal appeals to his assertion of attorney-client privilege in the Monica Lewinsky matter could yield two advantages : reducing th case to make it seem too minor for the Supreme Court to take on an expedited schedule , and limiting questioning of Bruce Lindsey , the Clinton confidant and director of damage control .
Does this mean that presidents will begin surrounding themselves with aides with law degrees ?

MODERNIZE-C5 _ Lockheed-Marietta and the U.S. Air Force are in discussions over a multi-billion dollar program to modernize the military 's fleet of C-5 heavy transport jets .
The talks were mentioned by U.S. Sen. Max Cleland on Monday at a Cobb County Chamber of Commerce speech .
A spokesman for Lockheed said the renovations would include the use of the same _ and warranteed _ General Electric engines now on big commercial jets .
And a glass cockpit .

PREACH-IN _ WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tony Hall , D-Ohio and the church network Call to Renewal sponsor a `` preach-in '' for the poor ohio , refused to pay for the surgery .
It took CIGNA a month to reach that decision and another month to review Branham 's appeal , even though its experts said the surgery was an accepted medical technique .
Branham 's tumors , meanwhile , doubled in size .
And four months after her initial request for coverage , she died .
Last month , the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Branham 's husband , Craig , has the right to sue CIGNA because a company clause requiring arbitation for disagreements was vague and therefore non-binding .

MEXICO-FIRES _ CHIAPAS STATE , Mexico -- Farmers and their agricultural methods have been blamed for the fires that have been raging in Mexico and Central America .
Why do farmers use fires to burn land for growing season with such potential danger ?
Are farmers concerned about the fires and are they rethinking their agricultural methods , or can they afford to ?
Federal officials assert that peasants encroaching on the rain forest are partly to blame .
But the peasants say there is no other way .
