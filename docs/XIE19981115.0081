China 's Largest Border City Opens Container Freight Line To Japan
SHENYANG , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Dandong , the largest border city in China , in Liaoning province , has opened a freight line for containers to Japan via the port of Dalian in the Northeast .
Dandong is on the border of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , near Japan and South Korea .
Some 20,000 containers move through here every year .
In the past they had to be transferred to other ports on land for further transit , so the new line is expected to cut costs by 40 percent .
Dandong and a Sino-Japanese international container warehousing and transport venture have spent nearly 10 million yuan on the new line .
