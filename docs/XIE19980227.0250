Pakistan 's PML Expresses Dismay over ANP Departing
ISLAMABAD , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The ruling Pakistan Muslim League ( N ) expressed dismay Thursday over the breaking of alliance by the Awami ( People 's ) National Party ( ANP ) .
" We are unhappy over departing of ways by the ANP , " said Sheikh Aftab Ahmed , chief whip of PML ( N ) in the National Assembly .
" This extreme decision should have been avoided in the greater national interest , " Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan .
The ANP Thursday formally broke its nine-year-old political alliance with the PML ( N ) following the categorical " No " by the PML ( N ) leadership over the issue of renaming the North West Frontier Province as Pukhtoonkhwa , which means a place where Pushto-speaking people live .
Federal Minister for Communication Azam Khan Hoti and three provincial ministers in the North West Frontier Province , who belong to the ANP , have announced their resignations from their posts in protest against the PML ( N ) 's rejection of the ANP decision to rename the province to give it an ethnic identity .
" In a democracy , such changes do take place , but it is a good omen that the ruling PML ( N ) , which was ( the ) founder of the country , refused to compromise on national interests , " Ahmed said .
He said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his party preferred to sacrifice their political interests rather than accept a demand which was contrary to the ideology and integrity of the country .
Ahmed regretted that the ANP broke its partnership with the PML ( N ) on a provincial matter rather than a national issue .
Ahmed made it clear that there was no agreement between the ANP and PML ( N ) for renaming the North West Frontier Province as Pakhtoonkhwa .
Even the overwhelming majority of the people were not in favor of the demand , he added .
He did not agree to the contention that the departure of the ANP would have a negative impact on the political environment , and destabilize the provincial government of the PML ( N ) .
He expressed the hope that in the backdrop of the long and close association and cooperation between the two sides , every effort ought to be made to ensure that no rancor or bitterness affect the future relationship of parties or aggravate the political environment in the country .
