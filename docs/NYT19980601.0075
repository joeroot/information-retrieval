ATLANTA _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing software developers back to the Macintosh .
It is they who will make or break this computer .
With useful , entertaining and progressive software , the Mac will thrive again .
It won n't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the platform .
Without developer support , the Mac will be like a jilted suitor , all dressed up with nowhere to go .
The problem isn n't there is no software for the Mac .
Apple Computer counts some 12,000 existing titles .
Yet this number is misleading .
It says nothing about the vibrancy of the market , how many titles are new , how many are regularly improved .
Software grows old fast .
Herein lies the problem .
Two years ago , 70 percent of all developers wrote either original Mac titles or Mac versions of Windows software .
Today , that number has dwindled to 20 percent .
That means a lot of those 12,000 titles are getting long in the tooth .
A vibrant , continually renewing roster of software titles is especially important in the home market .
Its growth has been driven by exciting new computer games .
Alas , most game developers are not writing for the Mac _ sadly , for good reason .
It 's very difficult to sell Mac titles .
Take id Software , developer of the popular shoot - ' em-up game `` Quake . ''
It did a Mac version of the original game but sold only 50,000 copies .
Not surprisingly , it didn n't bother with a Mac version of `` Quake II . ''
`` Every month I take a look at the number of Mac titles sold , and it is not good , '' says Luc Barthelet , general manager of game maker Maxis .
`` Sales are still declining month to month . ''
Not surprisingly , Barthelet has not decided yet whether Maxis will release a Mac version of its upgrade to `` SimCity , '' scheduled for release next fall .
Maxis is not alone .
Scores of developers never even bother with a Mac version of their games .
And many of those who do wait a year or more before releasing Mac versions .
That means Mac users rarely can play the hottest games on the market .
They 're second-class citizens in this arena .
This is a problem that must be solved .
Apple Computer thinks the key is its sizable presence in schools .
It 's nice that Apple Computer continues to be the largest supplier to the educational market , but this means little to kids .
What they want at home is not the same computer as in school but one that plays the most and the newest hot games .
Unfortunately , Macs are a distant second in this contest .
