China to Develop Computer Operating System
BEIJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's largest computer software company will join hands with Compaq Computer of the United States to develop one of the most powerful computer operating systems in the world .
China Computer Software and Technology Service Company will use Compaq 's Digital UNIX technology to develop a Chinese-based 64-digit operating system known as " COSIX . "
The two companies announced last week they have reached initial agreement on cooperative development of the new system .
General manager of the Chinese software company , Wang Zhigang , said cooperation will bring to the Chinese market a technologically advanced , safe , 64-digit Chinese UNIX operating system .
This powerful system is believed to be a match for Microsoft 's latest product .
The new operating system will be put under Chinese trademark , which means that China will own the software copyright .
China Computer Software and Technology Service Company , a subsidiary of the Ministry of Information Technology ( MII ) , is a national base of software development and production in north China .
The COSA V1.1 system platform developed by the company has won recommendations from the China Computer Software Association as one of the ten best software products of 1997 .
The new operating system will be a supplementary software for the system platform , which is run entirely in Chinese instead of English .
The development of the new software system is a national research and development project which will enable China to maintain copyright ranging from core systems to surface software .
Compaq has been merged with Digital Equipment , a major U.S. computer company , and Compaq 's UNIX system has been a major rival to Microsoft 's Windows system in the global market .
" We are glad that China Computer Software and Technology Service Company picked us as a cooperative partner .
We believe this is a very effective alliance for both parties , " a senior Compaq official said .
The newly founded MII has announced that promoting the development of national software industry is one of the ministry 's major tasks .
Annual output of China 's software industry has now exceeded one billion U.S. dollars , with more than 30 million U.S. dollars worth of the products exported per year .
