A BULGING X-FILES GAME
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By DAVID BLOOM c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES _ If you have a tough enough time every Sunday night unraveling the complex threads of a vast government-alien conspiracy involving shadowy figures with mysterious powers bent on subjugating the world , just wait until you try the X-Files interactive computer adventure game .
All seven CD-ROMs of it .
The massive X-Files game is out there , or at least it will be in a few days , arriving in stores a week or so ahead of the theatrical release of `` The X-Files '' movie and about three weeks after the end of the smash television show 's fifth season .
Think of the game as a way to get your X fix all summer .
With an 800-page script that has numerous possible endings , depending on your choices and attitudes , and takes 30 to 40 hours to play through each time , there 's enough to keep a game Xer , or X gamer , occupied until the new season starts in the fall .
`` To have a game with seven CDs is just insane , '' said Bill Paris , a video-game writer and columnist for Next Generation and PlayStation magazines .
`` That 's a new one on us . ''
The sheer size of the game , which is being billed as another episode of the show , is staggering compared to other games on the market , which seldom need more than two or three CD-ROMs to contain all their elements , said Paris .
And the space has been well-used .
After three years of work , they 've come up with a computer game every bit as distinctive and engaging as the show upon which it is based .
May the movie be as good .
The game 's excellence isn n't a total surprise , given the involvement of many of the talents _ on both sides of the camera _ who have made the show a smash hit for five years .
David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprise their roles as Fox Mulder and Dana Sculley , the pair of FBI agents who investigate paranormal X-file cases against a paranoiac backdrop of dark government conspiracy with aliens .
Show creator Chris Carter , writer / co-creator Frank Spotnitz , photography director Jon Joffin and music director Mark Snow also had a hand in the production , said associate producer Luke Letizia .
The game also includes such well-known supporting characters as Assistant Director Skinner and the loopy Lone Gunmen , the three technophiliac oddballs who help Mulder from time to time .
And because the game is set somewhere between the show 's third and fourth seasons , it even includes some long-dead characters , including `` X , '' the undercover operative who before his own untimely assassination sometimes fed information to Mulder , said Letizia .
`` The fact that they really do have the real people in there is a great boost , '' said Paris .
`` The problem someone like LucasArts has with their ( ` Star Wars ' movie-based game ) licenses is that they just put generic actors in those roles . ''
What 's different from the TV show or movie , of course , is that in the game , the player controls the story 's outcome through decisions and interactions with other characters .
The use of software called VirtualCinema 3.0 makes a big difference in the way the game plays , creating an experience far better than older games that use full-motion video to tell their stories .
The technology easily handles the demands of displaying high-quality video and audio while allowing players to click on clues , keep track of their equipment and work through the game 's complex story line .
The use of high-quality , letterboxed digital video shot specially for the game makes a big difference , too .
It just looks good , as sleek and dark and atmospheric as the Sunday night shows .
In all , the game 's producers shot more than 40 hours of video over seven weeks in Seattle last fall in between Vancouver shoots for the show .
The tape was eventually edited down to just four hours of footage , still a huge amount by computer-game standards , Letizia said .
The game starts as a player 's character , young FBI agent Craig Willmore , is summoned to the bureau director 's office and asked to locate the missing Sculley and Mulder .
Before heading out on the road in search of the pair , Agent Willmore gathers a variety of gear , including a Nokia cellular phone with a menu of built-in `` numbers '' for key sources , and a Newton 2000 personal digital assistant to navigate locations and access field notes .
The player also can log into the Intelligence Network Gateway , a computer system that provides still more information needed to track down Mulder and Sculley and help solve the case they have been investigating .
The game includes many delightful touches , including in-joke props that refer to various `` X-Files '' episodes , such as a book of Mulder 's by Jose Chung , the goofy character played by Charles Nelson Reilly in a particularly hilarious episode .
And of course , among the many preferences you can modify in the game are the beam and brightness of the player 's flashlight .
`` It wouldn n't be ` The X-Files ' without flashlights , so you can adjust that , '' Letizia said .
At many points in the game , the player is asked how to interact with other characters , with a choice of attitudes such as `` funny , '' `` indifferent '' or `` paranoid . ''
`` How you make those decisions affects how they ( the other characters ) react , '' Letizia said .
`` They may give you extra assistance , or throw you off ( the trail ) . ''
Really inappropriate or stupid behavior brings rebukes from other characters , or even leaves your character dead .
Game over .
Willmore on a slab .
Restart .
And because Fox expects the game to attract wide interest , it has included `` artificial intuition , '' sort of the computer equivalent of saying `` warmer , warmer '' when looking for clues .
`` The reason we put it in is there are a lot of ` X-Files ' fans out there who aren n't gamers , '' said Letizia .
`` Hard-core gamers can turn it off if they want . ''
Letizia said the game normally should take 30 to 40 hours to complete .
And because the story branches in significantly different ways , it is possible to play the game repeatedly and have a different experience each time .
`` There are several different endings , '' Letizia said .
`` So there 's definitely replayability . ''
The game shouldn n't be confused with the recently released X-Files Unrestricted Access CD-ROM , however .
That title , though attractively wrought , is designed to be something of an interactive encyclopedia of all things X. But it is no game , appealing mostly to hard-core fans who want to decorate their computers with `` X-Files '' wallpaper , parse through script synopses or check out a Web site for episode updates .
The X-Files game , however , should appeal to a much broader crowd , something Fox is counting on with a suggested retail price of $ 54.95 , only slightly higher than most computer games , even though it contains so many CD-ROMs .
Because of the game 's heavy use of video and demanding technology , it requires at least a 603 e PowerPC Macintosh or Pentium 120 MHz PC to run .
Fox officials are mum about how much they spent to create the game but said they are proud of the way it looks and plays .
`` We do think the overall project really sets the bar for full-motion video games .
We wanted to produce a first-class title , so we put a lot of resources into it , '' Letizia said .
`` But it 's not like ` Titanic ` . ''
