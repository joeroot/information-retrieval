PARCELLS ADDS SPICE TO JETS ' QUARTERBACK CONTROVERSY ( JT )
By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ Bill Parcells can be a pleasant sort of fellow , especially in commercials when he affects an almost jolly air .
And sometimes he is enigmatic , such as he was Tuesday .
Or was he ?
For Parcells , perhaps inadvertently , perhaps purposely , perhaps innocently , added drama to the Jets ' exhibition game against the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night _ if not to the entire Jets ' season .
He said Tuesday there was `` a pretty good chance '' he would start Vinny Testaverde at quarterback .
And yet Parcells also said , when asked about his starting quarterback down the road , `` Nothing has changed in this situation . ''
That would seem to indicate that Glenn Foley is still No. 1.
But the decision on who starts Saturday will be made on Wednesday , after Parcells discusses it with his staff , he said .
The news , even though it was hardly official , seemed to rattle Foley when reporters repeated it as he was leaving lunch .
He is , after all , the Jets ' starting quarterback and was told by Parcells that in the competition for the job , he gets `` the benefit of the doubt . ''
But suddenly , here were his freckles virtually draining from his face as he tried to deal with the surprising news .
`` I didn n't know that , '' he said .
But then he quickly added , minimizing the significance of it , `` It 's just a rotation . ''
Someone pointed out he didn n't seem happy about it .
`` I need reps with the first unit if he wants me to be the starting quarterback , '' Foley responded .
Foley speaks often about how little work he has had over the years , first as a No. 3 quarterback , then as a backup , in a career hampered by shoulder and knee injuries .
Testaverde was said to be at the dentist 's at lunchtime , and was not available for comment .
Meanwhile , Foley , despite the look of someone who had just had eight cavities filled , handled most of snaps at Tuesday 's workout , just as has done from the first day of training camp .
Throughout much of camp , the 34-year-old Testaverde has seemed sharper and looser than Foley , a gritty competitor who is a slow summertime starter .
But against the Eagles last Thursday in the Jets ' exhibition opener , Foley recovered from a stuttering opening quarter as he completed five of his last six passes .
The Jets scored 10 points in his three possessions , while Testaverde helped generate 10 points in the next four drives .
Testaverde had an impressive scrambling opening pass of 39 yards to Alex Van Dyke .
Tuesday , Parcells said of Testaverde , `` I think I 've got to give this guy a chance to play with the better guys , or the ones we think are the better guys . ''
He said he planned to play the first unit almost the entire first half , which is more than he did last week .
After practice , Parcells made it sound elemental : He wanted to see Testaverde with the first-string offense .
`` Wouldn n't you like to see Vinny with Keyshawn Johnson ? ''
the coach asked rhetorically .
`` With the Giants , I used to bring in Phil Simms third .
It would be Rutledge , Hostetler , Simms .
I 'm doing it with a bunch of guys on Saturday . ''
Of course , it never seems that simple with Parcells , who tries to think of everything that can go wrong before he considers what can go right .
These could be some other reasons he is starting Testaverde :
_ The Jets face the Ravens in Game 2 of the regular season .
By limiting Foley 's appearance on Saturday , they will not get a chance to become very familiar with him .
_ Perhaps he wants to raise Foley 's aggression by creating a virtual official competition .
_ He may want to be put Testaverde in a situation to pump him up .
Testaverde was cut by the Ravens , for whom he played the last two years .
_ He is preparing a quarterback shootout .
Interestingly , Testaverde 's father , Al , admitted he had mixed emotions about his son starting this weekend .
Al Testaverde has not seen his son play in person since suffering a heart attack at a game in Tampa Bay 10 years ago .
Even when his son went to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii two years ago , Al Testaverde went back to his hotel on Waikiki Beach to watch the game on television .
He is simply too nervous at the game .
`` It 's great for Vinny , '' Al Testaverde said Tuesday .
`` But it 's bad for me . ''
