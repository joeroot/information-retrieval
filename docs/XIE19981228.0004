Cyprus President to Visit Greece to End Missile
ATHENS , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides will arrive in Athens next Monday to discuss with Greek government leaders the planned deployment by Nicosia of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles with an aim to bring an end to the missile impasse .
During the visit , the third of its kind within this year , Clerides is also expected to convey to Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis the views of the leaders of Cyprus ' political parties on the recently-adopted U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding lowering tension and resuming inter-communal negotiations in Cyprus .
The Cypriot government announced in January last year plans to purchase the Russian S-300 missiles as a self-defense measures to partially counterbalance Turkey 's military superiority on the divided island .
Turkey , which currently keeps some 35,000 troops in the occupied northern Cyprus , has openly threatened to use force to prevent the missile installation , saying that the missile system will be a threat to the Turkish-Cypriot community and to the Turkish mainland .
The missile system is due for delivery in November but has been delayed as a result of the pressure given by the U.S. and some European countries as well as Turkey .
Clerides visited Greece in later November , but reportedly failed to reach a consensus with the Greek government concerning the missile deployment .
Greece , which signed with Cyprus a joint defense pact in 1993 , reportedly supports the idea of installing the missiles in the southern Greek island of Crete in order to avoid being dragged into hostilities with neighboring Turkey , but Clerides insists that the missiles will be deployed on the island republic as planned .
Analysts here believe that there is a possibility of breakthrough in Tuesday 's talks between Clerides and Simitis regarding the missile issue because the two U.N. Security Council resolutions have opened way for ending the S-300 impasse .
It is expected that Clerides will agree to deploy the S-300 on the Greek island of Crete instead of Cyprus .
