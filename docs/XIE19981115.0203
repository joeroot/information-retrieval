Annan Says Iraq Takes Step in Right Direction
UNITED NATIONS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Saturday that Iraq has taken " a step in the right direction , " but he thought the Security Council may ask the Iraqi Government for further clarification .
Annan , who headed off a major Iraqi crisis in February this year by a visit to Baghdad , made the statement in response to a press question as he was stepping into the U.N. building to attend the Security Council consultations , which is to kick off at 5 : 00 p.m. EST on Saturday .
The Security Council began another round of closed-door consultations as war threats looms large in the Gulf by Washington 's efforts to increase the military buildup in the region .
The Security Council is likely to focus on the Iraqi letter on arms inspections , handed to Annan on Saturday morning by Nizar Hamdoon , Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations .
The letter , a response by the Iraqi Government to a letter delivered from Annan to Baghdad on Friday night , said that Iraq allows U.N. arms inspectors to resume their work .
In return , Annan has described the letter as " positive . "
Hamdoon said that " conditions that are attached to our statement which has been clear-cut , obligating Iraq to resume cooperation with the UNSCOM , " which is the short form the U.N. Special Commission in charge of the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
As the Security Council is about to begin the rare weekend consultations , Hamdoon is waiting outside the Council chamber to be available for the 15-member Security Council to pass its decision made at the Saturday meeting , if any , to Baghdad .
" The Iraqi leadership has decided to resume full and complete cooperation with both the UNSCOM and the IAEA ( the International Atomic Energy Agency ) , " said the Iraqi ambassador .
He said that one of Iraq 's goals had been met -- Iraq has made it clear to the world its views and everyone was now aware of what Baghdad wants .
Iraq wants movement toward the lifting of 8-year economic sanctions against the Mideast country , imposed following it invaded Kuwait in August 1990 .
Sharply against the mounting military threats from Washington , China , France and Russia , three permanent members of the Security Council , have been reinforcing their efforts at the United Nations to seek a peaceful solution to the current crisis .
Baghdad suspended field inspections by the arms experts on August 5 and October 31 , it stopped the remainder of the inspections , later the UNSCOM , without consulting Security Council members , decided to evacuate its staff from Iraq on " strong recommendation " from Washington .
