New Variety of Cocoa Developed in Nigeria
LAGOS , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Nigeria , a major cocoa producing country , has developed a new variety of cocoa called " Hybrid " and 9.5 million Hybrid seedlings are on the verge of sale , The Guardian on Sunday reported .
The new variety has been developed by the Tree Crop Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources in Ondo State in cooperation with the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria .
The new breed combines high yield with early maturity , high resistance to disease and easier management , the paper said .
Henry Olaniyi Akingbulugbe , President of the Farmers ' Congress of the Ondo State , who has planted some hectares of the new seedlings , confirmed that the aroma of the hybrid is " very good " compared to that of the traditional variety .
He noted that the hybrid had been developed to rehabilitate cocoa farming and replace ageing trees in the country , especially in Ondo State , the largest cocoa producing state in Nigeria .
The new breed matures within 30 months compared to almost 60 months maturity period of earlier improved breeds and its output can reach one ton of cocoa beans per hectare in stead of 250 kilograms of cocoa beans from old variety .
