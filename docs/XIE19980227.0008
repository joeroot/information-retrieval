" Baby Benz " Reenters Market After 3-Month Suspension
BONN , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Germany 's Mercedes-Benz AG resumed the delivery of its ill-fated A-Class subcompact car Thursday after a three-month suspension to improve the car 's safety standards .
According to German press reports , 29 new A-Class cars were delivered to their buyers in the Mercedes-Benz plant in Rastatt Thursday .
The A-Class , dubbed " Baby Benz , " is the first-ever subcompact car introduced by the German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz last autumn .
However , its delivery was suspended later last year after several of them flipped over on sharp turns during safety tests .
Mercedes-Benz has since refitted more than 10,000 A-Class cars with an electronic balancing system as well as lowered bodywork and wider tires .
