Gold Demand in India Decreases
NEW DELHI , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Gold demand in India was " less lively " during July-September 1998 after exceptionally buoyant growth in the first two quarters , apparently dampened by economic problems , according to World Gold Council ( WGC ) sources here Thursday .
At 171.8 tons , demand fell eight percent below the record level of the third quarter of 1997 , but remained substantially higher than the the third quarter demand in earlier years .
Demand in the 25 key markets in the country for gold consumption monitored by WGC totaled 1,712.2 tons in the first three quarters of 1998 , which was down by 20 percent compared with the same period of last year .
Tensions with Pakistan and the effect of sanctions , imposed following India 's nuclear tests in May this year , along with domestic political uncertainties have hit confidence , WGC said .
The depreciation of rupee ( Indian currency ) since the beginning of the year and a rise in general import tariffs caused a surge in prices of basic foodstuffs draining consumer purchasing power , it said .
