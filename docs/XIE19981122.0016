Turkish PM Reelected Ruling Party Leader
ANKARA , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz Saturday was reelected as leader of the ruling center-right Motherland Party in its sixth congress .
The reelection of Yilmaz showed that his party has given him strong support on the brink of the collapse of the coalition government set up in June last year .
Accusing the minority government of corruption and having relations with gangs and mafia , three opposition parties of pro-Islamic Virtue Party , the True Path Party and the Republican People 's Party have asked the prime minister to resign ,
Turkish parliament has accepted three no-confidence motions aimed at toppling the government .
The crisis emerged after businessman Korkmaz Yigit claimed that Yilmaz rigged the bidding process of the Turkish Trade Bank .
If the government falls with the scheduled vote of confidence Wednesday , the parliamentary parties will have 45 days to form another coalition .
If they fail to do so , Turkish President Suleyman Demirel will appoint a caretaker government to rule until the next general elections on April 18 .
