She stressed need of peace education in Africa and said " we should prioritize investment in raising awareness about the dividends of peace and the downsides of war . "
" Peace education should encourage harmonious living , nurture a willingness to cooperate , and build constituencies for peace , " she said , adding that " civic education in schools can also build positive social values and promote democratic governance at the national as well as community levels .
