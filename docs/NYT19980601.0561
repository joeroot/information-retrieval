FAMILY CRISIS DRAWS THE SLOANS CLOSER ( JT )
( ATTN : Ill. ) By MIKE WISE c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
SALT LAKE CITY _ The invitations surprised Bobbye Sloan .
Her husband wanted her to come into the locker room after his team , the Utah Jazz , won the Western Conference finals .
He wanted her to ride the team bus back to the hotel .
In 35 years of marriage to Jerry Sloan , and to basketball , she had never felt so included , not in victory or in defeat .
She thought to herself , do I know this man ?
`` Jerry just always believed that 's not where family belongs , '' she said .
`` He thought it was a distraction .
Our son wanted to be a ball boy once , and he said , ` Absolutely not . ' It wasn n't part of his thinking . ''
The Jazz appear to be exactly where they were a year ago , preparing to face the Chicago Bulls for the National Basketball Association championship with the same veteran lineup and the same pick-and-roll style .
But for the coach and his wife , nothing is the same .
It hasn n't been since Steve Kerr hit the shot last June that ended Utah 's season .
That night Bobbye turned off the television , rolled over and realized there was a lump under her left breast .
The cancer was diagnosed within days .
Over the next few months , Bobbye Sloan struggled through surgery and chemotherapy .
Jerry Sloan struggled , too , trying to reconcile the personal and professional lives he had always thought should be kept separate .
While she was fighting the illness , her husband was fighting himself .
So far , both have been successful ; Bobbye 's cancer is in remission , while Jerry has paid more attention to their marriage and to his own health .
`` I guess that 's the biggest thing to come out of this , '' Jerry Sloan said .
`` The situation she 's gone through had made us more aware of each other , a lot more .
It 's turned out to be more than we ever expected . ''
The Sloans spoke last week as they sat on a couch in the wood-paneled den of their home , a modest condominium tucked beneath the snow-capped Wasatch Mountains .
The room was filled with antiques ; photos of a smiling Karl Malone and boxing gloves signed by Muhammad Ali were behind the bar .
There was also a photo of a Chicago Bulls team Sloan played on in the early 1970's , with Chet Walker and Bob Love _ a reminder of his side-burned past .
Jerry Sloan was born in the southern Illinois town of McLeansboro , where he retreats with Bobbye every off season and tends to his wheat , soybeans and corn .
He grew up there without his father , who died when Sloan was 4 , two years after he was injured in a farming accident .
Jerry met Bobbye at McLeansboro High School in 1957 .
She was the 5-foot-9-inch freshman class president .
He was the 5 - 6 vice president .
One day as the class officers lined up for yearbook photos , Bobbye noticed that her vice president was at eye level .
Looking down , she saw that Jerry was standing tiptoe on a water fountain pipe .
Jerry 's first request for a date was turned down because of his height .
After they finally dated , Bobbye told her mother in frustration , `` He didn n't say two words . ''
But the runt grew to 6 - 5.
They were engaged after high school , and he was offered a scholarship to the University of Illinois .
He promptly dropped out and wanted to move home to start a family .
Bobbye was in nursing school at the time and was determined to finish the three-year program .
`` Nope , '' she said .
`` I 'm going to do this .
I worked very hard to get here .
Either you find something to do with your life , or it 's done . ''
She broke off their engagement until Jerry enrolled at the University of Evansville .
They were married his sophomore year .
Until he became a Division II all-American and was drafted by the Baltimore Bullets , they lived on $ 5 a week .
After one season with Baltimore , Sloan went on to become one of the most menacing defenders the game has known with the Bulls .
His No. 4 jersey hangs in the United Center .
He gave so much of his body to basketball he can no longer run without one knee swelling like a grapefruit .
A concerned Dick Motta , the former Bulls coach , once said to him , `` You need a hobby . ''
As a player and later a coach , Sloan played hard , drank hard and enjoyed the NBA life .
He found it helped camouflage the anxiety elsewhere in his life .
Sloan 's playing career ended in 1976 , and the next year he agreed to become the coach at Evansville .
But the job did not feel right , and he reneged within days .
`` He just decided , my life has been in the NBA , that 's where I belong , '' Bobbye said .
He became an assistant coach with the Bulls .
Several months later , in December 1977 , the plane carrying the Evansville team he would have been coaching crashed .
Thirty people died , including the team and the coaching staff .
He had recruited two of the players .
The emotions he felt then would not surface again for 22 years .
`` You change every day , but I haven n't gone through something like this since the plane crash , '' Sloan said as he sat across from Bobbye in the den .
`` It doesn n't mean I would 've been on the plane for sure , but it certainly makes you more aware : what we do for a living is really not that important . ''
Last June , Bobbye went to Chicago for the first two games of the finals and attended the next three in Salt Lake City , as the Bulls took a three-games-to-two lead .
Then she stayed home and watched Game 6 from her bed as Utah 's bid for a title fell short .
She pulled the covers over her head with some solace : Jerry would be home on Saturday morning .
She felt a sharp , stinging pain shoot through her left breast .
`` I was hoping it was a cyst or maybe something else , but in the back of my mind I just kind of knew , '' she said .
She had been a registered nurse , and knew that cysts are usually liquid while cancerous tumors are usually solid .
`` Is it solid ? ''
she asked the woman performing the ultrasound test .
The woman nodded .
In July , Bettye underwent a modified mastectomy to remove seven lymph nodes .
After chemotheraphy treatments , she underwent breast reconstruction surgery in early January .
The surgery left a long scar , but made her feel whole again .
`` I don n't care about the scars or anything , I just want to be around to see my grandkids grow up , '' she said .

Because the cancer was detected at the earliest stage of development , and the disease is now in complete remission , her chances for survival are excellent .
She has devoted much of her time over the last few months to breast-cancer education , imploring women to have mammograms .
`` That 's been the biggest blessing , trying to get women to realize all they need to do is go in for an exam '' Bobbye said .
`` Along with Jerry changing , of course . ''
Sloan was not informed of his wife 's illness until two weeks after she felt the lump and the cancer was diagnosed .
She did not want to worry him or other family members , confiding only in doctors and her son , Brian .
A former University of Indiana guard - he played on Bob Knight 's 1987 national championship team - Brian had just finished medical school and was a resident at a hospital in Indianapolis .
He flew to Salt Lake City and called family members , including his father in McLeansboro .
Brian had written notes to help himself coach each person on what to say to his mother when she spoke with them .
Next to the name of his father , the eternal pessimist , he wrote : `` No long face , no doomsday , be positive .
Don n't be your usual , negative self . ''
Bettye recalled : `` Jerry called me and it was the fakiest voice you ever heard in your life .
` Hello .
How are you ? ' I couldn n't help but laugh , because it was the worst acting anyone had ever done in their life , especially him .
But I appreciated that , because ordinarily it would have been the woe-is-me stuff .
`` Anytime anything has ever been wrong , he 's not real good about it . ''
After Bettye 's initial surgery , while she was undergoing chemotherapy , Jerry was living the same old NBA life : three packs of cigarettes a day , and a few drinks at the hotel bar with some of his coaching staff .
`` He came home one night right after Christmas and had been out drinking and smelling like the bar , '' Bobbye said .
`` I said to him , ` Here I am , fighting for my life , and your snuffing yours out . ' ''
Holly , the Sloan 's 28-year-old daughter , said : `` Mom was mad .
Before she was diagnosed , she was working out , running half-marathons and quit smoking about 500 years ago .
And she 's the one who got sick . ''
Jerry Sloan decided to make changes .
The couple 's oldest daughter , Kathy , worked with a pharmaceutical company .
To help her father quit smoking , she recommended he begin taking Zyban , an anti-depressant that helps people wean themselves from nicotine .
He says he has not smoked a cigarette since February .
He quit frequenting the bars , too .
He and Bobby take long walks now , three miles in the morning and sometimes three more in the evening .
They end up at either an ice-cream shop or a Marie Callendar 's for a piece of pie .
`` We traded the bar in for the pie house , '' Bobbye said .
`` Never felt better , '' Jerry added .
`` It 's been the most rewarding year of my life .
You don n't expect things to change you at this age .
You have to be who you are .
But I guess a few adjustments now and then don n't hurt . ''
Sloan 's team saw subtle changes , too .
After a trade that would have sent Chris Morris and Greg Foster to Orlando for Rony Seikaly fell through , the Utah owner Larry Miller attended practice to soothe any damaged egos .
Sloan , standing nearby , was asked if he had anything to add .
`` He said , ` Yeah there is , ' and he started talking about Bobbye , '' Miller told The Salt Lake Tribune .
`` Blew my mind .
I think it blew everyone 's mind .
He said , ` I 've learned what 's important .
We all like to win basketball games , but winning games isn n't as important as your wife and your family and stuff like that . ' ''
That 's why Bobbye Sloan was on the team bus nine days ago .
It was her first time , but she acted as if she belonged .
She couldn n't wait for the give-and-take banter with John Stockton , a chronic needler who , she had been told , had a little nickname for her .
Climbing up the bus steps , she announced to the point guard , `` Here she is , the old ball and chain . ''
`` Oh , no , they told you ? ''
Stockton said .
Karl Malone quickly stepped into to bail out his teammate .
`` He meant you 're the good luck ball and chain , '' Malone said .
`` Everywhere you go , we win . ''
