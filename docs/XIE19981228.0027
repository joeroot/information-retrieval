Russia Calls for Peaceful Settlement of CIS Conflicts
MOSCOW , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Monday called on members of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) to try to solve their conflicts through peaceful means .
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Armenian counterpart Vartan Oskanyan following their talks , Ivanov said Russia was interested in full and final resolution of any conflict situations on the territory of CIS , because this is in line with Russia 's national , strategic and long-term interests .
Ivanov stressed that " speculations about Russia 's alleged interest in the maintenance of tension in various regions for the sake of preserving its presence or its influence there are absolutely groundless . "
Speaking about the critical assessment by Azerbaijan of Russian-Armenian military cooperation , Ivanov said , " the existing suspicions will gradually vanish along with the advance towards the settlement of the remaining problems . "
Azeri Foreign Minister Tofik Zulfagarov , who visited Moscow on December 23 , has expressed concern over Russia 's perceived expansion of military and technical ties with Armenia .
Ivanov said " when suspicions arise in anybody 's mind , they should be moved . "
" We have the right to discuss any problems and to remove the suspicions that may arise , using the way of a dialogue . "
Vartan Oskanyan , on his part , noted that Armenian-Russian military cooperation " is not directed in any way against any third country . "
It is absolutely transparent and is fully kept within the framework of European cooperation on conventional armaments , he said .
The Armenian foreign minister arrived in Russia for a working visit on Sunday and is expected to meet with Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov and the Russian president 's envoy in negotiation on settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict , Yuri Yukalov .
The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh erupted in 1988 and has remained one of Armenia 's major problems .
The international community , primarily Russia , has been working to secure a political settlement of the conflict .
