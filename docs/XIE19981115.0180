Iraqi Decision to Allow Arms Inspection Unconditional : Aziz
BAGHDAD , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz stressed on Sunday that the Iraqi decision to allow the resumption of U.N. weapons inspections was unconditional .
He told reporters that the annex attached to the letter on the Iraqi decision he sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday " does not mount to conditions . "
Aziz 's remarks came after U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger alleged that the two-page annex contains conditions , saying the letter " is neither unequivocal nor unconditional . "
It is not immediately known what the annex is about , but Iraqi representative to the U.N. Nazar Hamdoon said in New York that it was not linked with the letter and it was just what Iraq hoped to see after resuming cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors .
Berger said Iraq 's offer was " unacceptable " and the U.S. remained poised for military action against Iraq .
Earlier Saturday , Annan described Aziz 's letter as " positive , " saying that he believed it met U.N. requirements in resolving the latest crisis .
Iraqi leadership on October 31 decided to halt all forms of cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq ( UNSCOM ) until the U.N. Security Council moves toward lifting the U.N. trade sanctions imposed on it for more than eight years .
The U.S. has been stepping up its military presence in the Gulf in preparation for an attack to force Iraq to withdraw its decision .
Iraq said on Saturday it would allow an unconditional resumption of U.N. weapons inspections , a move many observers believe that will possibly ward off an imminent U.S. military strike .
