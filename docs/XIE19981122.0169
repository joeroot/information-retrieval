Venables Says Allegations Are " Rubbish "
LONDON , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Terry Venables , manager of the Crystal Palace football club , said that the allegations against him were " absolute rubbish " .
According to the Independent newspaper on Saturday , police in Hampshire are investigating the transfer of five Australian players to Portsmouth Football Club while the former England and Spurs manager Terry Venables was chairman .
The report also said that police officers have asked Interpol to make inquiries in Australia .
But Venables said on Saturday evening that the allegations were " absolute rubbish " .
After his current team Crystal Palace had lost at Swindon , Venables said : " I have got nothing to say about it and I have never heard from anyone .
" The front page of that national newspaper was absolute rubbish . "
He also described earlier press reports as " fabrication " .
Fraud squad officers are looking into " allegations of bad business practice " brought to their attention by the current board .
Central to the concerns raised are " the transfer of five Australian players bought by Terry Venables when he was at the club " , according to the police .
After leaving his job as England coach , Venables moved on to take up the same post with the Australian football side .
It was pipped to qualify for the 1998 World Cup , in France , by the Iranian national team .
The allegations come soon after Crystal Palace called in the Football Association to examine the transfers of two Chinese players Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai after a discrepancy was revealed between the fee and the amount the Chinese authorities were expecting to receive .
