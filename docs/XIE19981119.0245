U.S. to Sell More Warships to Turkey
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. Defense Department announced on Wednesday it was planning to sell 11 surplus naval frigates to Turkey for 205 million U.S. dollars .
The Pentagon announced the package of three guided-missile Perry Class frigates and eight Knox Class vessels would include 20,000 rounds of 20 mm ammunition and preparations to make the ships ready to operate .
The eight older Knox Class vessels are already being leased by the Turkish Navy , and the Ankara government already has three other Perry Class frigates in its fleet .
While the ships would upgrade Turkey 's Navy and improve its anti-submarine ability , " the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not affect the basic military balance in the region , " said the Pentagon .
The proposed sale will need to be approved by the U.S. Congress .
The U.S. has continued to sell sophisticated arms to both Greece and Turkey over the past year based on their defense modernization needs as allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) .
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained because of a dispute over the island of Cyprus .
