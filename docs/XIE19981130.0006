India 's Congress Party Not to Pull Down BJP-led Government
NEW DELHI , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- The Congress party made it clear on Sunday that it would not pull down the central government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party following its landslide victory in three of the four states which conducted assembly elections .
The biggest opposition party in India got unprecedented majorities in the states of Rajasthan and Delhi and retained power in Madhya Pradesh in the elections , the results of which were published here Sunday .
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said that he was prepared to face any challenge from the opposition including a trial of strength in the winter session of Parliament beginning on Monday
As the Congress and other opposition party leaders asked the Congress to take initiative to usher in a fresh realignment of forces against the BJP , Congress President Sonia Gandhi told the press here that " we will wait for it to fall . "
Meanwhile , Vajpayee met top leaders of his party at separate meetings of the BJP executive and Parliamentary Board and the leaders of the allied parties .
It was reported that the BJP had finalized a strategy to face the opposition onslaught in Parliament .
According to final results of the polls just released by the Election Commission , the Congress won 380 of the 626 assembly seats in the states of Madhya Pradesh , Delhi , Rajasthan and Mizoram , far ahead of the ruling BJP by 212 seats .
It won a major victory in Rajasthan , where the BJP had ruled for eight years , with 150 seats gained out of the total of 197 while the BJP got only 33 .
In Delhi , which was also ruled by the BJP , the Congress wrested power from the BJP with 51 of the 69 seats , pushing the latter a distant second at only 15 .
Analysts here said that a flood of onion tears besides rises in prices of other essential commodities was one of the factors which helped Congress win the assembly election in the national capital .
In Madhya Pradesh , the BJP 's hopes of overthrowing the ruling Congress were dashed as the ruling party received 173 of the 320 seats , leading the BJP ahead by 53 .
Asked to comment on the outcome of the results of the assembly elections , Vajpayee conceded Saturday that while in Delhi , the BJP was not very optimistic , but the outcome of the polls in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh had come as a " complete surprise to him and other BJP leaders .
Although the Congress strategy for dealing with the political turmoil was yet to be finalized , several important leaders of the party confidently predicted the fall of the BJP government with the withdrawal of support by some of the 13 allies now backing it .
However , virtually all of BJP allies except All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( AIADMK ) , which had threatened to withdraw support to the BJP coalition , expressed their solidarity with the government on Sunday .
At the meeting Vajpayee had with leaders of allied parties Sunday , it was decided that the ruling coalition would oppose any no confidence motion that might be tabled by the opposition .
The left parties , which also met here Sunday , decided that it would press for the resignation of the government , which they said lost its moral and political legitimacy to rule .
