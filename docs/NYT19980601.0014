TWO KILLED WHEN THUNDERSTORMS TEAR THROUGH MASSACHUSETTS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By STEPHANIE EBBERT c.1998 The Boston Globe
BOSTON _ Raging winds , hail , and blinding thunderstorms pummeled much of Massachusetts Sunday night , killing two people in a pickup truck in Winchendon , Mass. , cutting power lines , toppling tree limbs , and threatening tornadoes for much of the night .
With tornado watches in effect throughout the region at least until early Monday , Doppler radar showed a twister may have touched down in Worcester County Sunday night , the National Weather Service reported .
Meteorologists could not confirm a tornado until ground damage could be assessed .
Earlier , a funnel cloud was spotted in Pittsfield , according to Weather Services Corp. in Lexington , but there were no reports that it had touched down .
The storm swept eastward from New York state , but spared New England much of the devastation it had wrought there .
Trees blew through homes and houses were leveled in Mechanicville , N.Y . , north of Albany , authorities reported .
But the storm was furious in its wrath here as well : Golf-ball-sized hail tumbled from the sky above Walpole , N.H . , leaving cars dented , said Marc Bennett , a Weather Services Corp. meteorologist .
In Lawrence , Mass. , almost two-tenths of an inch of rain fell in seven minutes _ a phenomenal amount of water , Bennett said .
And Worcester Airport recorded a 94 m.p.h .
wind gust after 10 p.m. , said Doug Cope , information officer for Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency .
In Winchendon , near the New Hampshire state line , two men driving a pickup truck along Route 202 were killed when a pine tree snapped and toppled onto the 1994 Toyota pickup , just after 6 p.m.
`` We heard the tree break and I knew somebody had hit it , '' said Charlie Higgins , who lives with his wife at the site of the accident .
Estimating the tree to be 50 feet tall and two feet in diameter , Higgins said the pine broke about 10 feet off the ground .
The driver , DanielMallet , 25 , of Athol , and passenger Michael J. Gulbicki , 27 , of Winchendon , were pronounced dead at the scene , police said .
In Pepperell , another fallen tree destroyed a car and slightly injured a driver .
Much of the damage occurred in Franklin and Worcester counties , where trees and power wires were downed .
Greenfield reported a wind gust of 68 m.p.h . , according to Jennifer Kensy , a Weather Services Corp. meteorologist .
Massachusetts Electric Co. reported 11,000 customers losing electricity , largely in the Merrimac Valley , the Worcester area , and central Massachusetts , said spokeswoman Maureen McDowell .
At its height , Western Massachusetts Electric reported 5,287 customers without electric , mostly in Greenfield , the Pittsfield district , and later in west Springfield .
Both utilities were working to restore power last night .
The storm , blown in from New York state after 5 p.m. , first attacked Pittsfield , then tracked more northeast , cutting a swath of precipitation and wind across the top of the state and into southern Vermont and New Hampshire , Bennett said .
It was part of the same system that wracked South Dakota , said Alan Dunham , meteorologist with the National Weather Service , of the twisters that virtually leveled the town of Spencer , S.D . , Saturday night .
The storm then raged through the midwest , killing several people .
The torrential weather was expected to dissipate overnight .
Weather Services Corp. predicts sun and breezy conditions on Monday , with a temperature of about 75 degrees .
