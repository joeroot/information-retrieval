A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BANANA TO SAVE THE THIRD WORLD ?

LONDON _ Sometimes in science , things do not happen singly , but come along in threes , like buses .
Earlier this week the giant agribusiness company Monsanto announced that it has worked out how to generate cotton that is naturally blue .
Meanwhile , clinical trials with people in Baltimore have shown that a genetically-engineered potato can confer resistance to `` traveller 's diarrhea '' caused by varieties of the E.coli bacterium .
And now , in this week 's science journal `` Nature , '' a team from the University of Exeter announce that it has finally worked out how plants produce vitamin C _ opening the way , it says , to genetically-engineered versions of the fruit which produce far greater amounts of such useful vitamins .
Biologists are increasingly able to map out the locations of every gene in a plant or bacterium , and they are increasingly sure what each of those genes does , and how they interact .
At the more complex level of the functioning bacterium , plant or _ ultimately _ human being , our knowledge is also advancing in leaps and bounds .
So new applications , such as the three listed above , are becoming almost routine .
Scarcely a day goes by without some announcement from a company involved with genes .
But while gene-jeans may excite casual interest , the real focus is on altering plants so that they will become truly useful `` factories '' for chemicals such as vaccines ; or simply making them more fertile , so that the same land area can feed the ever-expanding number of mouths in the world .
Potentially , the first of those applications could cut through many of the problem of immunization in developing countries .
Rather than having to organize widespread campaigns involving injections _ with all the attendant problems of sterilization and distribution of syringes and refrigerated vaccines _ health workers would simply provide genetically-engineered crops .
By eating the produce , people would immunize themselves against diseases such as hepatitis , malaria and rabies , and childhood diseases such as diphtheria , rubella , and measles .
Similarly , the Exeter team 's unravelling of the `` chemical pathway '' by which plants make vitamin C is a key advance which ends a 40-year search .
`` In the long run it means , if people so wish , that we can genetically engineer plants to have altered vitamin C content .
That has potential benefits in both nutrition and for the ability of plants to withstand various kinds of environmental stresses that would normally reduce crop yield , '' said Nicholas Smirnoff , a lecturer in plant biochemistry who led the research at Exeter .
`` Until we made our discovery it was essentially impossible to do that , but now we know the pathway , we can identify the genes involved . ''
Within the next year they should be able to begin experiments to genetically boost the vitamin C content of fruit and vegetables .
The idea of `` edible vaccines '' is not limited to academia , though .
It is big business .
Among them is Cambridge-based Axis Genetics , which is working on a number of schemes to coax vaccines out of transgenic plants .
`` There are two main approaches , '' said Iain Cubitt , chief executive of Axis Genetics .
`` First , engineer viruses that normally attack plants so they put proteins from disease-causing organisms on their surface , so that the plants produce a vaccine to them .
Secondly , engineer the plants to make the vaccine directly .
Most of that work has been done in the U.S. ''
The experiment with genetically-engineered potatoes , by the Boise Thompson Institute of Cornell University , New York , is one outgrowth of that .
`` It 's taken five or six years to reach this stage , '' said Dr. Cubitt .
`` Now , our main business is producing vaccines from plants . ''
Doing that requires a three-way understanding of genes and organisms .
Immunization essentially teaches the body to watch out for particular proteins found on the `` coats '' of unwanted bacteria or viruses .
This means that rather than injecting the whole organism , a particular protein can be identified which will serve to alert the body of an infection .
If you can work out which gene makes the required protein , then you are just one step away from your target ; all you need to do is find a way for your required plant to make it , by adding the gene to the plant in such a way that it is `` expressed '' in the fruit , skin or other useful part .
Surprisingly , this is one area where the small start-ups _ often outgrowths of academic research _ have an advantage over the big pharmaceutical companies .
`` The big companies aren n't involved yet , because I think they have been cynical about doing things with plants , '' said Dr. Cubitt .
Similar efforts are being made with standard crops : already , just 15 crop plants provide 90 percent of the world 's food energy .
