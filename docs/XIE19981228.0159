1998 - 12-28
Year-ender : 1998 , Africa 's Year of Collective Peace-keeping
NAIROBI , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Collective Peace-keeping efforts have been the highlight of African politics in the year 1998 , contributing to the continent 's stability , although leaving much to be desired .
In the year , conflicts , old and new , have continued or erupted across the continent , urging the African states to launch joint peace-keeping efforts .
In contrast to the cooling down of most old hot spots in recent years , the chronic civil war in Angola re-ignited after a dormant period .
New conflicts have also added to the long list of unrest on the continent in the passing year .
Civil wars or regional conflicts broke out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Lesotho , Guinea-Bissau , the Comoros and between Ethiopia and Eritrea .
These conflicts derailed African states ' pains-taking efforts to rejuvenate their economies and frustrated their ambition to boost their shares in the global economy and their voice in world politics .
It is tragic that fighting , after decades of independence of these countries , still haunts and hinders their development .
It has become a common belief among most African countries that these conflicts , influencing the neighboring nations or the whole continent , must be addressed with concerted and coordinated efforts of all the countries concerned or the whole African community .
That is why African international organizations have carried out numerous diplomatic mediations and military interventions in the passing year .
Generally speaking , most of these efforts have attained the desired goals , but more remained to be made before peace and prosperity bloom on this old continent .
Lesotho , a tranquil , tiny enclave country within South Africa , was plunged into turmoil in May .
At the request of the Lesotho government , South Africa and Botswana , on a mandate of the South African Development Community ( SADC ) , sent troops into Lesotho and quickly put out the armed turmoil .
Mediated by the SADC , the Lesotho government and opposition parties later reached agreement on holding new general elections within the following 15 to 18 months , bringing peace back to the south African state .
The end of Guinea-Bissau 's conflict is another example of Africa 's successful collective peace-keeping efforts .
The conflict had broken out in June and turned hundreds of thousands of people into refugees .
