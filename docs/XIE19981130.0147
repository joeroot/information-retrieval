Kuala Lumpur High Court Judge S. Augustine Paul made the order after Zainur refused to apologize over his application to remove two senior Deputy Public Prosecutors from conducting the prosecution in Anwar 's on-going corruption trial which entered the 16th day Monday .
Anwar , who faces five corruption charges and five sodomy charges , has pleaded not guilty to the charges , related to allegations that he used his position to cover up claims of sexual misconduct .
Zainur had filed Anwar 's application to remove Abdul Gani and Azahar , charging them with " going out of their way " to get Anwar 's tennis partner , S. Nallakaruppan , to fabricate evidence in order to charge him ( Anwar ) with further sexual offenses .
Anwar claimed that Abdul Gani had indicated to Nallakaruppan 's lawyer , Manjeet Singh Dhillon , that he would consider reducing Nallakaruppan 's charge if he was prepared to " falsely implicate me ( Anwar ) in the commission of sexual offenses with various married and unmarried women . "
Nallakaruppan is facing a charge of unlawful possession of bullets under the Internal Security Act which carries the death penalty upon conviction .
Anwar 's application was filed in the High Court over the weekend by Zainur .
Justice Augustine Paul said he had found that there was no such fabrication as alleged in the application .
The High Court also issued a warrant of arrest against lawyer Manjeet Singh Dhillon for contempt of court over the same issue .
Manjeet should be brought to the High Court as soon as possible to show cause why he should not be charged for contempt of court , Justice Augustine Paul said .
