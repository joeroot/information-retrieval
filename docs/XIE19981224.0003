Chief Executive Promises More Help for Sports in HK
HONG KONG , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) promised here on Wednesday that the SAR government would provide more backing to sports development in Hong Kong .
The chief executive made the promise at a celebration reception held Wednesday evening by the Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee ( ASF&AMP ; OC ) of Hong Kong , China , for the Hong Kong SAR delegation at the 13th Asian Games , which closed on Sunday in Bangkok .
Competing in the Asian Games in the name of " Hong Kong , China " for the first time after Hong Kong 's handover , Hong Kong SAR athletes won five gold , six silver and six bronze medals , the best ever achievement by Hong Kong at any of the regional Games .
Tung recalled that the Hong Kong SAR government had attached importance to its sports policy , which is to ensure that all promising athletes are given proper funding to fully develop their talents .
" I fully support sports development and will make sure that resources are allocated to meet various needs and facilities are provided to promote sports development , " he said .
The HKSAR government has increased the subsidies for sports development from 78 million HK dollars ( 10 million U.S. dollars ) in 1996 / 97 , to 200 million HK dollars ( 25.6 million U.S. dollars ) this year , of which 60 million HK dollars ( 7.7 million U.S. dollars ) was earmarked for elite training , according to Tung .
Provisions had been made for the athletes preparing for the 1998 Asian Games and additional subsidies had also been given to physically handicapped athletes .
But Tung admitted that the government could still do better .
Upon her return from Bangkok days ago , Olympic and Asian Games champion windsurfer Lee Lai-shan talked about the second career of athletes as well as their opportunities of further studies after they retire .
That " really inspired strong feelings in me , " Tung said .
And he agreed to the idea of professionalization of sports , raised by ASF&AMP ; OC President Timothy Fok at the reception .
" This is also a good direction we should look into , " Tung said .
Tung expressed his belief that the success achieved in Bangkok would urge the government and the entire community to play a more active role in promoting sports development .
" Here I make a pledge to all athletes of Hong Kong that we will definitely attach great importance to your concerns , " he said .
