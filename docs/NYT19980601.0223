RECALLING THE PASSION , SOUL OF BOBBY KENNEDY
Commentary ( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) `` Some people see things as they are and ask why .
But I dream things that never were and ask , why not ? ''
_ Robert F. Kennedy , quoting George Bernard Shaw By CARY CLACK c.1998 San Antonio Express-News
SAN ANTONIO _ Robert F. Kennedy was the one politician who told us to dream .
The one politician who spoke with passion to the problems of society and the world and challenged us to do something about it .
One of the reasons for the spiritual drift of the United States is that we lack leaders who can speak to our longing for a better world ; who can inspire our imagination and urge us to work toward that world .
Bobby Kennedy did this .
He imagined Mississippi and Appalachia without the grinding poverty and asked , why not ?
He imagined farm workers and blue-collar workers being treated with dignity and paid a living wage and asked , why not ?
He imagined a nation healed of the violence and racism that scarred it and asked , why not ?
He imagined the end to the Vietnam War and all wars , and asked , why not ?
On a trip to South Africa in 1966 , he said : `` We all struggle to transcend the cruelties and the follies of mankind .
That struggle will not be won by standing aloof and pointing a finger : it will be won by action , by men who commit their every resource of mind and body to the education and improvement of their fellow man . ''
Thirty years ago this week , just minutes after winning the California Democratic presidential primary , with the Democratic Party nomination and the White House within his grasp , Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in a hotel pantry while shaking the hands of kitchen workers .
He was 42 .
It is fruitless to wonder what might have been had Kennedy lived .
What is known is that this nation lost a vigorous and prophetic voice that was always raised in outrage against injustice and suffering .
His conscience and heart were magnets drawn to the dispossessed .
Where they were is where he went .
He visited the ghettos , reservations , fields and factories to bear witness to their suffering so that others would know about it .
Where are the politicians ( Do they exist ? ) who will visit these places ?
Are there any who can unleash the power of our imagination to dream ?
Are there any who can rekindle hope in the dying embers of a nation 's soul ?
Are there any who can speak words like this , the extemporaneous speech that Bobby Kennedy gave in Indianapolis just minutes after learning of the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He ended it by saying :
`` What we need in the United States is not hatred , what we need in the United States is not lawlessness , but love and wisdom and compassion toward one another , and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country , whether they be white or they be black .
Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago : ` To tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world . ' Let us dedicate ourselves to that , and say a prayer for our country and our people . ''
Once there was passion .
Once there was soul .
If this nation and this world are to ever be made better , we must get them back .
