FRUIT OF THE LOOM UPDATES ITS MESSAGE
( ja ) By STUART ELLIOTT c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ Since the days when Carmen Miranda wore fruit on her head , consumers have been urged to wear Fruit of the Loom apparel on their bodies .
Now the brand is changing its advertising in an attempt to create a more contemporary image .
A lighthearted campaign being introduced this week by Warwick Baker O ' Neill in New York , which focuses on newer , more colorful and fashionable types of clothing , declares that `` Every body loves Fruit . ''
The television , print and outdoor ads are the first the agency has produced since winning the account late last year , with billings estimated at $ 20 million to $ 25 million .
`` This advertising is the public expression of efforts going on at Fruit of the Loom to modernize their offerings , '' said Kevin O ' Neill , president and chief creative officer at Warwick Baker , who offered a preview of the campaign .
`` Its mission is to reawaken the affection and awareness consumers have for the brand and to expand the understanding of Fruit 's products . ''
The campaign is indicative of large-scale attempts by venerable brands to update their sales pitches , particularly in crowded consumer-product categories like apparel .
Fruit of the Loom Inc. has been laying off employees , closing plants and shifting production to cheaper sites overseas , in response to intensifying competition among makers of underwear and casual wear for men , women and children .
The Hanes brand sold by Sara Lee Corp. has long battled Fruit of the Loom for supremacy in the market segment of lower-priced clothing sold by mass merchandisers .
Hanes is widely considered to have successfully freshened its advertising with slick , upbeat campaigns by Long Haymes Carr in Winston-Salem , N.C . , part of the Interpublic Group of Cos. , which carry the theme `` Just wait till we get our Hanes on you . ''
At the same time , as the economy improves , many consumers who have bought Fruit of the Loom are tempted to `` trade up '' to higher-priced brands , especially those bearing designer labels .
The new campaign represents a gamble for Fruit of the Loom because the company does not want to alienate traditional , value-minded buyers as it tries to attract younger , less conventional consumers with offerings like men 's boxers and boxer briefs and women 's thongs and bikini briefs .
For instance , the waistbands of some kinds of boxer briefs are emblazoned with the initials `` FTL '' in place of `` Fruit of the Loom '' or the familiar fruit emblem .
`` The answer was in the brand itself , '' said William Mulligan Jr. , client services director at Warwick Baker , because consumers who were asked to talk about Fruit of the Loom in research sessions used words like `` approachable , sexy , wholesome , friendly , relevant . ''
So while a television commercial for men 's apparel features buff , shirtless 20-somethings , they are smiling and clean-cut rather than sullen and sprouting stubble .
`` In keeping with the broad appeal of the brand , '' said John Wendler , senior vice president for marketing at Fruit of the Loom in Bowling Green , Ky. , the models are intended to be `` all-American , regular guys who want to wear fashionable products , '' rather than `` chiseled , edgy , European-looking . ''
`` The advertising is graphically representative of the new stylishness of our product lines , '' Wendler said .
`` It captures all the positives about the brand while reinterpreting it and re-presenting it as up to trend , as it were . ''
The campaign places emphasis on what executives at Fruit of the Loom and Warwick Baker refer to as the brand 's `` fruitness , '' which O ' Neill described as an `` essential playfulness and friskiness , capturing the fit and fashion . ''
For example , the commercial shows vignettes with tongue-in-cheek titles : `` Peeling Fruit , '' for a tot removing his T-shirt ; `` Wild Fruit , '' for a man romping with his dog in a field .
And print ads for women 's apparel carry such headlines as `` Instead of Serving Fruit , Why Not Let Fruit Serve You ? ''
and `` You 're Not the First Woman in the World to be Tempted by Fruit . ''

Fruit of the Loom previously tried to modify attitudes about its products with a humorous campaign by offices of the Leo Burnett Co. , which was centered on clotheslines displaying colorful apparel .
`` The campaign was very successful and really got noticed , '' Wendler said , `` but it was a little bit limited '' because `` it relied on a very strong visual device . ''
`` ` Every body loves Fruit ' gives us the flexibility to advertise our broad range of products , '' he added , `` and portrays the products in a more stylish manner than ` Clotheslines ' did . ''
Burnett resigned the account rather than take part in a review that began in October .
The new commercials will run during television programs like `` ER , '' `` NYPD Blue , '' `` The X-Files '' and the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League championship finals .
Print ads will appear in such magazines as Essence , Glamour , Good Housekeeping , Mademoiselle , Parents , People , TV Guide and Vogue .
As for the outdoor ads , Wendler said , `` we are considering high-visibility locations like Times Square in addition to general outdoor around the country , to make a statement about what the brand is all about today . ''
Was any thought given to reviving the `` Fruit Guys , '' the actors who once brought to life the fruit in the brand 's emblem ?
`` Not for long , '' O ' Neill answered , laughing .
Though `` they did a wonderful job '' demonstrating fruitness , he said , it was `` in a different time and place . ''
Besides , one Fruit Guy would probably demand a raise : F. Murray Abraham , who went on to win an Academy Award for `` Amadeus . ''
