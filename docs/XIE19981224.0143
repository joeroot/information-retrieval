Chinese Farmers Doing Better After Moving From Dam Site ( 1 )
CHONGQING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Liao Xianhai , a farmer in Fengjie County of Southwest China 's Chongqing , recently moved into a new house because his former home lay in the path of China 's Three Gorges Dam Project .
Liao 's is one of tens of thousands of rural households who will have to leave their ancestral land because of the world 's largest hydro-electric power program .
When the program is completed , it will create a reservoir with a capacity of 39 billion cubic meters of water .
The project is intended to handle the flood that happens in 100 years and to protect the prosperous lower reaches of the Yangtze River and help economic growth with electricity produced by 26 giant generators .
Liao has built a 150-sq-m two-story house with 25,000 yuan in relocation subsidies provided by the government and his own savings .
Liao and 1.2 million other local people will have to build a new life on new land .
Since 1993 , 150,000 people have been resettled .
Liao said , " I have benefited a lot from the new location because I can easily transport farm produce to a town where prices are higher .
In the slack season , I can earn pocket money by selling home-grown fruits on the roadside . "
Last year , the net income of his five-member family was above 10,000 yuan , compared to the per-capita income of 1,000 yuan in the local area .
He is among the 2,000-plus migrant farmers who have benefited from a relocation program called " relocation along the road , " which means building a road along the Yangtze River , rows of new houses along the road and a plot of farmland in the rear of a house .
