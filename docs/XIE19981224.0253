Turkey Criticizes U.N. Resolutions on Cyprus Issue
ANKARA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Turkey and Turkish Cypriots-controlled northern Cyprus Wednesday criticized the U.N. Security Council resolutions 1217 and 1218 adopted on Tuesday regarding the efforts to solve Cyprus issue .
In the resolutions , the Security Council expressed deep concern over the continuing militarization efforts in Cyprus and asserted that the ultimate solution for the long-divided island should be a single independent state based on the political equality of the two communities .
The resolutions did not mention the planned deployment of Russian-made S-300 missiles by Cyprus .
In a written statement , the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the resolutions failed to mention the confederation proposal put forward by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash .
The statement stressed that a final solution to the Cyprus issue could not be achieved on a bi-communal basis , but only on a state-to-state basis .
" The acknowledgement of two separate sovereign and equal states is a precondition for the resolution of an array of problems in Cyprus , " it said .
Meanwhile , Denktash said the resolutions favored Greek Cypriots and encouraged them in their intransigent stance , saying that " as long as the international community continues to recognize Greek Cyprus as ' the Cyprus government ' , the only thing we can do is to resist and not bow to pressure . "
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the founding of " Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " in 1983 which is only recognized by Turkey .
Cyprus was divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops took over the northern third of the island in response to a pro-Athens coup .
Tension between the governments of Turkey and Cyprus has grown noticeably since Cyprus announced that she was purchasing S-300 ground-to-air missiles from Moscow .
Turkey has threatened to take out the missiles if they are deployed on the island .
