SOUTH DAKOTANS STILL STUNNED IN AFTERMATH OF TORNADO

SPENCER , S.D .
_ There 's no explaining the things fate chooses to spare .
The mutilated green shell that used to be the house of 86-year-old Marlys Muters was ankle deep in broken glass and mangled furniture on Monday , but just outside lay one of those musical Mother 's Day cards and it was playing `` Be it ever so humble , there 's no place like home . ''
The two-story house of Ward and Gloria Satterlee , the minister and organist at the Nazarene Church , is now an eviscerated mound of splinters and shreds , but somehow sticking out untouched from the pile was a white sheaf of church music , a piece called `` Alleluja ! ''
And though almost everything in Lucille Mone 's house came crashing down around her , sitting serenely on the wall is a framed puzzle of a cool , green Irish countryside and a clock that is still telling time .
Mrs. Mone , a sprightly 89-year-old woman who springs around on a wooden cane , was hoping Monday to salvage one more thing : her husband James ' false teeth .
`` They were in a cup in the bathroom , and he was in bed and the storm blew him out of bed so bad , he couldn n't find the floor and that 's when he got hurt , '' said Mrs. Mone , whose husband , 95 , was still in the hospital with a broken shoulder and broken ribs .
`` They were Omaha teeth .
You can n't get them in South Dakota . ''
Two days after a ferocious tornado steamrolled the tiny hamlet of Spencer , people here were setting their minds on the simple things .
They almost had to .
So much had been destroyed _ every business and all but a dozen or so houses _ that the 320 people living here did not know where to begin .
The 100-mph twister carved a southeastern slash across South Dakota 's corn-wheat-and-soybean territory Saturday night , but it hit hardest in Spencer , virtually destroying this mile-square community .
It struck so hard and fast that it fizzled the town 's electricity before the tornado warning siren could sound .
Six people were killed and 150 others , half the population , were injured .
The dead were all older people , for they are the people who remain in the pin-dot places of the Great Plains , the places the Interstate ignores and the cities carry on without .
The youngest was Ron Selken , a 62-year-old retired concrete laborer .
Two of the women died in a home for the elderly on Main Street , the only paved road in town .
A 93-year-old widow , Mildred Pugh , was crushed under the library 's bookmobile trailer .
And Gloria Satterlee , 71 , was yanked to her death as she and her husband were hurrying from the kitchen into the basement .
`` I had her by the hand , '' her husband , Ward , 74 , said Monday , watching as relatives combed through the rubble of his house and came up with an old Bible .
`` She said , ` Just a minute , I want to get the dog . ' I let go of her hand and that 's the last I seen of her .
I was pinned with some kitchen floor on top of me .
I called to her about 10 or 20 times and never got an answer . ''
Satterlee 's face was a torment of purple abrasions _ he was released from the hospital Monday morning after being treated for the cuts on his face , a gash in his side and a burn from the hail that pounded him while the tornado kept him trapped .
On Monday , President Clinton named Spencer a federal disaster area and offered the community the full range of disaster-relief services , from temporary housing to rebuilding roads to small business loans .
Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency said there was no way to estimate how much damage was done .
`` Look around , '' said Richard Weiland , the regional director of the emergency agency .
`` What can you count ?
It 's all gone . ''

Standing on a cement slab that marked the remains of a shattered house , Gov. Bill Janklow insisted Monday that the town would be rebuilt .
`` You should have seen it when the pioneers got here , '' the governor said .
`` We built a town here .
We 'll build another town .
Will everybody live here ?
No. But a year from today we 're going to have a town . ''
To drive the point home further , Janklow said : `` Look , how 'd you like to be in Berlin after the war ?
But Spencer 's going to have what Spencer had before . ''
But residents here are not so sure .
`` Well , there 's nothing to come back to _ just my grave in the cemetery , '' said Mrs. Mones , who was born in Spencer .
`` I suppose this will wipe it out , '' said Cal Muters , 53 , Mrs. Muters ' son , as he searched for family photographs in his mother 's house , which was so devastated she could not yet bring herself to see it .
Even the mayor of Spencer , Rocky Kirby , who also owns the grain elevator , was skeptical about rebuilding .
`` These little towns out here in South Dakota are on their way out , '' he said .
In truth , what Spencer had has been diminishing over the years .
Built about 120 years ago in the grassland about 50 miles west of Sioux Falls , Spencer has seen its population dwindle by half over the last few decades as young people grew up and moved away .
The year before last , the school was closed because there were not enough children for classes .
`` There used to be 22 businesses downtown , '' said Everett McDaniel , who was born here 68 years ago .
`` Now there 's just the bank , the post office , the grain elevator , Spencer Automotive , and the antique store . ''
At least that was what there was before Saturday .
Now , the silos at Spencer Grain Co. are crushed like soda cans .
The 120-foot blue water tower is twisted into ruins , sharp spiky strips of metal , with the name Spencer visible through the wreckage upside down .
All five churches in town were flattened .
The library , fire department and post office are tortured piles of brick and wood .
And all that remains of the Security State Bank branch is the steel vault , sticking up like a pyramid in a desert .
People here said that the twister was so furious that a blank check from the bank was found in Laverne , Minn. , 100 miles away .
`` It 's kind of hard to tell where one house ends and another begins , '' said Jane Kingsbury , who was searching a pile of rubble that , as near as she could tell , contained all that was left of her daughter 's house that used to stand across the street .
On Monday , the electric company began what will be a two-week process of hooking up the town 's electricity .
Emergency Management crews uprooted the shredded remains of trees and bulldozed away walls and ceilings and doors .
Since Sunday , about 80 members of the National Guard have been deployed to secure the area and prevent looting .
And each family was assigned a cadre of prison inmates to help them sift through their belongings .
The governor deployed 100 inmates from the Springfield State Penitentiary here because , he said , `` I think it 's beneficial to have inmates see human suffering . ''
As the gray rain gave way to a simmering sun Monday , Mabel Allen , 86 , who has lived here since she was in third grade , was sitting on a folding chair outside what had been her home , the senior citizen apartments , as her daughter and grandson brought her fragments of her life that they found blocks away .
`` It seemed like it lasted forever , '' Ms. Allen said , recalling how she cowered under a staircase when the winds hit .
`` I don n't know how long it was .
We prayed and screamed is what we did .
And then everything was gone . ''
