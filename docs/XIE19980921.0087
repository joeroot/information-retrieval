Indonesia Giving Priority to Securing Adequate
JAKARTA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesian ministers Monday said that the top priority of the government is securing adequate staple commodity stocks for the country 's needy people , according to Antara News Agency .
" Our greatest concern now is how this country can be rescued from its present crisis , " National Development Planning Minister Boediono said in Yogyakarta , Central Java .
In an extra-curricular lecture to state-run Gadjah Mada University students , Boediono said the development strategy the government had been implementing so far was focused on meeting the people 's need for affordable essential goods .
The government was also continuing to do its best to stabilize the soaring prices of staple commodities in markets around the archipelago to enable people at the lowest level of society to buy them .
" One of the ways the government is pursuing to stabilize fluctuating market prices is providing subsidies , " he said .
It was reported that 17 million families in the country are facing food shortages now .
In Central and East Java provinces , 60 percent of 7.3 million poor families ( averaging four people to a household ) could afford only one meal a day .
Meanwhile , Minister for Cooperative and Small / Medium Enterprises Adi Sasono told a meeting in South Sulawesi province 's capital of Ujung Pandang that Indonesia would hopefully be able to get out of its crisis within the next three months .
Sasono said he hoped stability of prices of daily necessaries could be reached by the end of this year if the government gave priority to the stabilization of the prices of daily necessities and the provision of adequate stocks .
Since the country was hit by the economic crisis , the number of families living under poverty line is reported to have increased from 22 million to 79 million people .
