REEVE TELLS OF ORDEAL WITH CANDOR , HUMOR
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By CLIFFORD PUGH c.1998 Houston Chronicle
In the months after Christopher Reeve suffered a riding accident that paralyzed him from the neck down , he sought escape in sleep .
In his dreams he would be whole again and able to resume his active life .
Then he would wake up in his hospital room , stare at a screen that monitored his vital signs and wonder why he was still alive .
With the love of his wife , friends and family , his attitude gradually changed .
He stopped wondering , `` What life do I have ? ''
and began to consider , `` What life can I build ? ''
In `` Still Me '' ( Random House , $ 25 ) , Reeve writes movingly about his accident , which occurred three years ago , and its aftermath .
It is an optimistic yet realistic account that avoids the cloying , everyone-lives-happily-ever-after quality of such stories .
From an early age , Reeve writes , he was someone who enjoyed being in control .
However , his self-contained world was shattered after his parents divorced when he was young .
He sought solace in acting and began a career that reached its pinnacle when he was cast as Superman in the 1978 hit movie .
He also appeared as the Man of Steel in three sequels .
Although he continued to work regularly in movies and stage plays , his career had stalled by the mid-1990s .
But his personal life was fulfilling _ he was happily married to Dana Morosini and the father of three children _ and active .
An accomplished equestrian , he entered a riding competition in Virginia on Memorial Day 1995 .
It was to be his last competition of the season , as he planned to leave for Ireland five days later to film a movie .
While on the course , his horse stopped suddenly at a fence and flipped Reeve to the ground .
He landed on his head .
While his helmet prevented brain damage , the impact of the landing broke his first and second vertebrae .
Reeve later learned that if he had landed with his head slightly more to the left , he would have been killed instantly .
If he had landed slightly more to the right , he probably would have sustained only minor bruises .
His injuries were so serious that , upon being told by doctors he had a slim chance for survival , his mother begged them to `` pull the plug '' and withdraw life support .
Even when Reeve was stabilized , he considered ending his life when doctors first told him his prognosis .
He was likely never to regain any feeling below his shoulder blades and would probably spend the rest of his life breathing with a ventilator .
His wife said she would support whatever decision he made .
But , she added , she would be with him for the long haul , no matter what .
`` Then she added the words that saved my life : ` You 're still you .
And I love you , '' ' he writes .
In the book Reeve details the high points of his life since the accident , including his electrifying surprise appearance at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1996 and his stint as director of the critically acclaimed HBO film `` In the Gloaming . ''
He also writes movingly about his setbacks .
He has been hospitalized 11 times , has come close to death twice and almost had to have his left ankle amputated when infection set in .
Putting him to bed takes two hours every night and includes a humiliating process of eliminating bodily wastes with the help of an aide .
It takes attendants two hours to get him up in the morning .
`` When two people have to roll you back and forth in order to put on your underpants at age 45 , it 's a difficult lesson in patience and acceptance , '' he writes .
He also writes movingly of the pain of not being able to hug his son and how he becomes angry at times with the turn his life has taken .
But there is much humor in the book .
Reeve writes how , while he was waiting for surgery a few days after the accident , actor Robin Williams arrived in the room dressed as a doctor .
`` He announced that he was a proctologist and had to examine me immediately , '' Reeve writes .
`` And for the first time since the accident I laughed . ''
The book is also filled with forgiveness .
Reeve writes how he has become closer to his estranged father since the accident and even refuses to blame the horse that threw him .
More important , Reeve learned to forgive himself .
`` For more than a year I wondered if the injury was purely an accident or if I was responsible for what happened , '' he writes .
`` I learned that endless speculation serves no purpose other than torment . ''
It is such honest and realistic writing that makes Reeve 's book a powerful read .
He doesn n't shy away from the realities of his life as a quadriplegic .
He doesn n't apologize for his ambivalent feelings .
And he doesn n't tone down his opinions to make the reader feel more comfortable .
Reeve has become an outspoken advocate for people with spinal-cord injuries .
He is chairman of the board of the American Paralysis Foundation and founded the Christopher Reeve Foundation to fund promising research into spinal-cord regeneration using antibodies and nerve growth factors .
He has regained some sensation below the neck , across his shoulders and down his left arm and leg .
He can now turn his head 70 degrees on each side and breathe on his own for up to half an hour .
He recognizes he has a long way to go to regain movement and feeling in the rest of his body , but he hasn n't given up hope .
Reeve has also become a vigorous critic of insurance companies that limit treatment to people with spinal-cord injuries .
He acknowledges how fortunate he is to have the resources for round-the-clock care that are not available to others with similar injuries .
When doing publicity for the first Superman movie , Reeve defined a hero as `` someone who commits a courageous action without considering the consequences . ''
Since the accident , his definition has changed .
He writes that he now thinks of a hero as `` an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles . ''
`` Still Me '' proves that Reeve is a hero under any definition .
By facing his situation with honor , humor and candor , he is more of a Superman in real life than he ever was in the movies .
