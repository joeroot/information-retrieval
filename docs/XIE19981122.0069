Angolan Govt Launches Attacks on UNITA
LUANDA , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Angolan government is launching large-scale attacks on the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) in central part of the country .
The attacks , which has been going on for a week , is part of the plan for the government forces to restore government institutions throughout the country , the independent Actual weekly reported Sunday .
Fighting is now concentrated in Bie Province 's Alto Hama areas , a strategic point linking the central areas to UNITA 's bases in the eastern part of the country .
The government forces had surrounded UNITA 's political and military capital of Andulo in Bie Province and Bailundo in Huambo Province , after breaking through the rebel forces ' first front .
Joan de Matos , Chief of Staff of the government forces , is very much worried over the situation in the diamond-rich Lunda-Norte Province and Lunda-Sul Province , after he toured the two provinces .
UNITA has been relying on diamonds there for its logistics supply .
Fighting has been very fierce in the central part of the country , with reportedly the Kuito Hospital in Bie Province being full of wounded soldiers of the government forces .
While the government refuses to give any information on the reported fightings , the U.N. Special Envoy Issa Diallo issued a statement Saturday , saying that " peace process is in crisis " and urged Angolan people " not to give up hope " , and continue to carry out the Lusaka Peace Protocol .
