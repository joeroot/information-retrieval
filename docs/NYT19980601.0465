PHILADELPHIA _ After three months of fruitless negotiations , the city 's largest transit union went on strike Monday , shutting down a nexus of buses , trolleys and subways that serves up to 435,000 people a day .
Because negotiations had been going on since March , the city was not caught unawares .
The municipal government and many employers had contingency plans in place for their workers that included private buses , extra cars on the regional railroads that continue to operate and free parking throughout the city .
For those who live in the suburbs , the strike meant somewhat heavier rush-hour traffic , and Mayor Edward Rendell predicted that downtown businesses could suffer .
But the largest burden seemed to fall on working-class people with no cars who rely on public transportation to reach school and work .
Negotiations for a 3-year labor agreement that had proceeded intermittently broke off after a brief session on Sunday with management and union leaders agreeing only that vast differences remained in their bargaining positions .
Certain that no breakthrough was possible , Steven Brookens , president of the Transport Workers Union 234 , appeared at a morning news conference to announce that his 5,400 members would walk off their jobs as drivers and maintenance workers at noon .
They did , and three hours later several hundred strikers staged a noisy demonstration at City Hall and briefly blocked traffic in front of management headquarters .
`` It 's over , '' Brookens said .
`` We tried the best we could . ''
John Leary Jr. , general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority , spoke to reporters as the strike began .
`` We hoped it would not have gotten to this point , '' he said .
`` It 's a crying shame .
This is senseless .
It 's needless .
Our riders deserve much better than this . ''
Philadelphians are accustomed to disputes between transit unions and the transportation authority , commonly known as SEPTA .
This was the fifth work stoppage in 21 years , the second in three years ; there was a two-week shutdown of the system in 1995 .
But a strike was hardly welcome at a time when Philadelphia is charging ahead with efforts to market itself as a reborn urban center , rich in tourist attractions , vibrant night life and world-class cultural sites .
And the city had become one of a half-dozen contenders for the Republican national convention in 2000 .
It was just too bad for Rendell , a Democrat , that the Republicans ' site-selection committee picked Monday to start a three-day visit .
Union leaders are particularly opposed to proposed changes in workplace rules , including liberal use of part-time workers .
They claim management is insisting on the changes as a wedge to destroy the union .
But management officials , clinging to a stance they have held since negotiations began , said Monday that the offer they made on Saturday , which replicates a deal that the city 's other transit union overwhelmingly accepted and includes a 9 percent pay raise over three years , was the best the striking union could expect .
`` We put together a package that represents a wonderful economic deal , '' said David Cohen , SEPTA 's chief labor strategist and former chief of staff to Rendell .
Rendell said in an interview that he had urged union leaders to accept what he called `` an outstanding offer '' from SEPTA .
`` The problem , '' he said , `` is that anything other than this deal would require a raise in fares , which are already the highest in the nation .
That would mean a decline in service .
Then we would lose ridership , and that would cost the union jobs . ''

Rendell said he was especially disturbed that the union would choose the Republicans ' first event , a visit to Independence Mall , for a demonstration .
Philadelphia has not been host to a national political convention in 50 years .
Republicans and contingency plans aside , the start of the strike caused an array of problems .
Bradford Eads , a security guard at Temple University who usually takes a bus , hitched a ride home with a neighbor but got there an hour later than usual .
For Tempris Smiley , a sixth-grader who takes a bus and subway each way to school , the strike means forgoing the final two weeks of classes .
`` This will cause me to fail , '' she said , although Rendell said he expected schools to make allowances for absence or tardiness .
Even striking drivers expressed uncertainty over a work stoppage that some union members said could last months .
At the Midvale District depot , where drivers exchanged their empty buses for picket signs , Bernie Grant , 30 , a bus driver for five years , watched the scene unfold with mixed emotions .
All around him , his colleagues were barking out their protest chants .
`` They might look like they 're having a good time , '' he said .
`` But you 've got to stand up for what you believe in and be strong .
Nobody wants to be out here , and I may be smiling on the outside , but inside I 'm hurting . ''
