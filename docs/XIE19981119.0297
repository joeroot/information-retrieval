England Beat Czech Republic in Soccer Friendly
Well-drilled first-half goals from Darren Anderton and Paul Merson were the least England deserved , after they survived some early scares from their highly-rated opponents to give the crowd an exhibition in attacking football .
Hoddle went into the game with the criticism of England 's recent poor displays and reports of clashes with his players ringing in his ears .
But his controversial selection policies paid off as an experimental side clicked into gear , with David Beckham pulling the strings in the center of midfield .
In the absence of first-choice strikers Alan Shearer and Michael Owen , Hoddle opted for a less than youthful front pairing - 29-year-old Dion Dublin joining 35-year-old Ian Wright in attack .
And Wright proved the star of the show , as the West Ham veteran pulled the Czech defense all over the park with his foraging runs and provided the crosses for both goals .
Dublin too had his moments as target man and in the eighth minute he showed how confident he is after scoring five goals in his first two games for new club Aston Villa .
Beckham played Anderton into space on the right , the Tottenham star turned and crossed to the edge of the area and Dublin struck a first-time volley , which blazed over the bar .
But a minute later the Czechs showed they had not come to Wembley as the supporting cast , as they came so close to scoring a stunning opener .
Vladimir Smicer began a superb attack with a rampaging run at the heart of the England defense .
He then slipped a precise through-ball into the path of Pavel Kuka , who hit a delicious diagonal chip with his first touch , which left Nigel Martyn flailing but ricocheted back off the bar .
England were stung into action and should have gone ahead on 16 minutes when Beckham 's corner found Dublin unmarked 12 yards out , but the striker 's downward header was cleared by Jiri Novotny at the far post .
But it did not take long for England to stamp their authority on the game .
With 22 minutes on the clock , Wright dragged down Graeme Le Saux 's long pass , spun off his marker and sprinted towards the by-line , before hooking a low cross into the area .
The ball evaded Dublin 's stretch , but no-one had picked up Anderton 's late run into the area and the wing-back stroked a left-foot shot into the bottom corner .
And the second goal , with 39 minutes on the clock , was a near replica of the first .
Again Wright found himself wide on the left flank , and again he beat his man and crossed into the box - but this time Dublin nodded the ball down and Merson , unmarked on the right , swept the ball home .
Beckham came close with a curling long-range effort in injury time as England ended the first half on a high .
The second period began in the same vein and Graeme Le Saux should have made it 3 - 0 in the 49th minute .
Dublin forced the ball back from the by-line to the Chelsea star in the six yard box , but Le Saux hit his shot straight at Kouba .
Five minutes later the Czech keeper did well to palm away Beckham 's stinging drive and the lurking Wright failed to get a clean connection on the rebound .
A mistake by stand-in skipper Sol Campbell then gave the Czechs a rare chance to reduce the arrears but substitute Vratislav Lokvenc volleyed over the bar .
Wright was forced off in the 67th minute after pulling a muscle as he turned and shot straight at the keeper and was replaced by Robbie Fowler .
And a minute later Anderton headed wide from Beckham 's near-post cross .
Teenager Lee Hendie was given his debut in the 76th minute , in place of Villa team-mate Merson .
The Czechs had their best chance of the second half after 78 minutes , when Martyn had to be at his sharpest to get down and hold a low shot from Lokvnec .
Hendrie was denied the chance of a fairytale debut two minutes from time , when he wove his way into the box but pulled a diagonal shot just wide with only Kouba to beat .
" I was very pleased with the team 's performance , " a beaming Hoddle said .
" Every single individual put a lot in and they all got a lot out of the game .
It was an excellent performance really .
" If we had taken our chances in the second half it could have been four or five .
That would have really been a just result .
" I am very pleased with the movement , very pleased with some of the play and it 's a bit of experience for quite of few of them
" I said going into the game that we obviously wanted to win as professionals , and you could see in that performance that they are winners , " he added .
