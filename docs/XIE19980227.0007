China Adds Modern Definitions to " Lei Feng Spirit " ( 2 )
An official in northeast China 's Fushun City , where Lei Feng served in the army , said that today 's Chinese society is haunted by many social worries , such as people 's indifference to each other , confusion in moral standards and distortion of social values .
" In the eyes of the general public , the Lei Feng Spirit represents sincerity , kindness and purity .
They wish to use it to purify society , " he said .
He went on to explain that there is also something in Lei Feng 's spirit that can help solve some of the most pressing problems in modern China , such as the reform of state-owned enterprises , which has led to massive layoffs of redundant workers .
" Lei Feng put the interests of the country first , and was always ready to make sacrifices .
He was never overwhelmed by difficult situations , but often encouraged people to help and love each other .
His spirit can keep the people in a good mood and help ease social tension , " the official explained .
He added that Lei Feng 's dedication to his work is also a precious legacy for today 's Chinese workers , who should immerse themselves in the establishment of the modern enterprise system in China .
A State Council official noted that today 's Chinese people should learn something from the plain and frugal life of Lei Feng , and resolutely fight against waste , extravagance and corruption .
The Chinese Communist Youth League , China 's leading youth organization , has called on the country 's youngsters to learn from Lei Feng by offering more free community services , especially for poor people and laid-off workers .
A sociologist in Beijing commented that the " Lei Feng Spirit " is an almost perfect combination of the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation and Communist ideology , and therefore will have a lasting impact on Chinese society .
" It can always have new definitions suited to the demands of the times , and can be accepted by people living in different periods or with different social statuses , " he asserted .
