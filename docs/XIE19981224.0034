Hopeful Opposition Party Emerges in Zambia
LUSAKA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- A new opposition party , the United Party for National Development ( UPND ) , has emerged on the Zambian political arena and it offers a charming future to the Zambian people .
Officially launching the UPND here Thursday , the party 's interim president Anderson Mazoka said his party has come into being against the background that there is no effective opposition to the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy ( MMD ) and that no party can offer viable political , economic and social alternatives to those of the MMD .
He told hundreds of jubilant party cadres that the UPND is determined to take power in the country 's next presidential elections to be held in 2001 .
Mazoka , out-going chief executive for east and central Africa of Anglo-American Corporation , a trans-national company , lashed out at the ruling MMD government for its serious deficiency in leadership skills , poor governance and mismanagement of the country 's economic affairs .
The presidential aspirant offered a " bright " future for the Zambian people by listing his party 's main principles concerning the areas of agriculture , social welfare , health and poverty reducing .
Mazoka , a newly-emerging political star , said that when forming the next government , his party will give agriculture first priority , in which lies the future of Zambia .
" We realize that the future of our country and its prosperity will only be possible if we reorganize , invest and support the agricultural sector , " he noted .
Mazoka also promised that his party will institute poverty alleviation measures that will improve incomes , create assets and improve social welfare of the people in both urban and rural areas .
He said the UPND aims to reduce poverty to below 20 percent of the population instead of the proposed 50 percent that the MMD has undertaken to the donor community in the next few years in the country where over 70 percent are living in poverty .
At the meeting , Mazoka also announced the formation of the UPND 's executive organization , the Interim National Management Committee ( NMC ) .
A prominent Zambian lawyer , John Mwila , became one of the party 's two vice-presidents and Standwell Mapara is the national chairman .
According to UPND press officer , Sialumba Caesar , the new opposition party is attracting several hundred new members and more every day since it came into being last month .
