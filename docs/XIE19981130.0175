Roundup : India 's Ruling Party Prepares for Stormy
NEW DELHI , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Following the rout in the just concluded four state assembly elections of Delhi , Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram , the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) at the Center has decided to analyze the cause of the defeat and take up the new challenge ahead of it .
To counter the low morale of partymen and prepare them for a stormy winter session of Parliament , which is scheduled to start from Monday , Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Sunday gave a pep talk to the BJP parliamentary party executives and assured them of their allies ' support to face the challenge " unitedly " .
" We have got a mandate to sit in the Opposition in the Assemblies .
We will obey it and act as a responsible Opposition party , " he said , referring to the election losses in Delhi , Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh states .
Some BJP members and its allies even said that the Assembly election results , which were generally regarded as a referendum , would not pose any threat to the central government .
The Congress winning a big victory in the assembly elections is expected to move an adjournment motion in the Parliament on the spiraling prices to expose the " fragility " of the Vajpayee government on the issue .
Congress President Sonia Gandhi has given the green signal for the move in the winter session aiming at parliamentary censure against the ruling party and government .
The Congress , however , decided not to take any immediate plan to topple the central government , but to take a wait-and-watch attitude at the moment .
In one of its resolutions here Sunday , the Congress Working Committee ( CWC ) , the highest policy-making body of the party , described the victory in the assembly elections as a vote for Mrs. Sonia Gandhi 's leadership and against the " anti-people " policies of the BJP government at the center and in the states .
But the CWC did not demand the resignation of the prime minister , in line with the stand of Sonia Gandhi , who gave indications to reporters the Congress was prepared to wait for the moment .
She also indicated that the party was ready for a mid-term poll if it was forced upon the country .
The Congress has won 173 of the 320 seats in Madhya Pradesh , 150 of the 200 seats in Rajasthan and 51 of the 70 seats in Delhi .
The BJP 's tally is 120 , 33 and 15 respectively .
After Sonia cleared the plan for an adjournment motion , Congress Parliamentary Party leaders immediately began consultations with other Opposition leaders on the strategy to be adopted on the floor of the two Houses .
The Congress is confident that the BJP allies will not stand up for the BJP on the price issue and that a Parliamentary censure is certain .
Although the government will not have to quit if the House adopts the adjournment motion , the prime minister and the BJP will lose face .
The ruling party will be left with no option but to acknowledge that it had mismanaged the price issue , the Congress party sources said .
In the case of a no-trust motion , the allies of the BJP may decide to stick together for the time being as they do not see an alternative in sight .
Sonia Gandhi maintains this is not the right time for a no-trust motion , they said .
The Left Front in the country is said to have stopped short of demanding an outright resignation from the Central Government , but observed that it had " no moral right to continue " in view of a " clear verdict " in the assembly polls .
" If they do , it would be an affront to the people , " said senior leader of the Communist Party of India ( Marxism ) Somnath Chatterjee .
