Russian Economic Woes Spark Investor Panic
Panic swept through Russia 's financial markets as foreign investors feared that the ruble would be devalued .
Interest rates tripled and the stock market plummeted .
From the White House to the Kremlin , officials were concerned that the setback could destabilize the new Russian democracy .
By the end of the week , there was some good news : the International Monetary Fund said it would provide the next $ 670 million installment of its $ 10 billion loan .
But Yeltsin government officials were worried that the IMF money was too little , too late .
It sent a team to Washington to discuss the need for billions of dollars in additional financing .

U.S. May Have Helped India Hide Nuclear Test Sites
An intelligence board will report this week on why the United States failed to foresee this month 's nuclear tests by India , which spurred tests in Pakistan and incited what President Clinton calls a `` dangerous arms race . ''
Washington may have unwittingly schooled India in the art of deception .
In December 1995 , spy satellites saw India preparing for a nuclear test .
United States diplomats showed the spy satellite photos to Indian officials in persuading them not to test .
What looked like a triumph of diplomacy may have been an unintended gift to India .
Some government officials now say that showing those photos to the Indians revealed how the United States spied on the test site , and thus enabled India to conceal its preparations this time around .

Court Backs Police In High-Speed Chases
Several hundred people die every year as the result of high-speed police chases .
A Supreme Court decision has now reduced nearly to the vanishing point the chance that any of their families will be able to collect damages , even for police behavior that is reckless to the point of negligence .
The court unanimously ruled that only a chase undertaken with `` a purpose to cause harm '' can be found to violate the constitutional guarantee of due process .
The justices overturned a ruling by the federal appeals court in California _ home of the televised high-speed chase _ that had set the more plaintiff-friendly standard of `` deliberate indifference '' as the measure of police liability .
Deliberation was not a sensible test for a situation that calls for split-second judgment , Justice David Souter said .

Starr Wants Quick Decision
Kenneth Starr , the Whitewater independent counsel , asked the Supreme Court to rule quickly on whether two of President Clinton 's aides must appear before the grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter .
A federal judge in Washington had ordered the aides to appear , but the White House is appealing the ruling .
The aides , Sidney Blumenthal and Bruce Lindsey , have refused to answer some questions _ citing executive privilege and attorney-client privilege _ about conversations they had with the president , the first lady and other officials and witnesses .
Ms. Lewinsky stopped by the local FBI office to give handwriting samples and fingerprints to investigators who have spent the last few months attempting to corroborate some of the things she said about the president in conversations recorded by her former friend , Linda Tripp .

Lyme Disease Vaccine Gets Cautious Push
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the United States , and its sometimes debilitating symptoms _ arthritis and damage to the nervous system and heart _ underscore the need for a vaccine .
An advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of the first such vaccine , but with ambivalence about its safety and effectiveness .
It takes three injections and a year to gain maximum protection , about 80 percent .
But no one knows how often booster doses will be required or whether repeated shots will be safe .
Also uncertain is whether the vaccine is safe for those with arthritis or undetected Lyme disease .
The committee called on the manufacturer , SmithKline Beecham , to continue testing the vaccine , particularly in children .
For now , it is recommended only for people from 15 to 70 .

Making Money at Home
Even as the tides of free trade , globalized investments and regional currencies are washing over every continent , there are islands of resistance ..
In 66 towns and villages in Canada and the United States , people are printing their own money _ from Sand Dollars in Bolinas , Calif. , to Mountain Money in Hot Springs , N.C . , to Thread City Bread in Willimantic , Conn.
All of these currencies , printed in kaleidoscopic colors , tend to be denominated in hours , with one hour worth $ 10 .
But they are not simply displays of design and engraving .
The idea is to create a system designed to promote the use of a scrip that can only be used locally , so that trade will stay a bit more securely within the communities .
In places like Ithaca , N.Y . , where the system has been running for seven years , the equivalent of millions of dollars in business has been done in the local currency , Ithaca Hours , and it is accepted by a local hospital , a federal credit union , grocery and book stores , hair salons and chiropractors .

A Growing Case Against Swiss Banks
A long-awaited report sponsored by the Swiss government confirmed the central bank 's complicity in accepting gold looted from Holocaust victims , bolstering allegations by Jewish groups that Switzerland traded in wartime misery .
Not only did Swiss bankers ignore the gold 's origin , they also considered melting it down to disguise it , the study said .
Although the report , produced by a panel of nine Swiss and international historians , discounted profit as a motive , it noted the Swiss National Bank was Germany 's biggest client , buying gold that would be worth $ 2.5 billion today .
The study , meant to show Switzerland 's willingness to come clean on its wartime record , only upped the ante for Jewish leaders , who intensified demands for reparations .

Viagra for the Poor
The Clinton administration suggested that Medicaid may have to pay for Viagra , the new impotency pill .
Federal officials said the Medicaid law seems to require that states must cover most prescription drugs when they are used for purposes approved by the Food and Drug Administration , as is the case with Viagra .
State Medicaid officials insisted that Viagra might enhance the quality of life , but was , in many cases , not medically necessary .

Warning About Wall Street
New York City 's government , struggling to balance its books just two years ago , will end the fiscal year with a surplus of $ 2 billion .
The windfall comes from Wall Street _ and that 's the danger , say analysts .
They warn that the city is getting an increasing share of its revenues from taxes collected from Wall Street 's workers and companies .
They say politicians are not doing enough to prepare for the inevitable market decline .
