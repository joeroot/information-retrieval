Willis Wants NBA Vote in Secret
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Kevin Willis , Toronto Raptors forward , wants his NBA peers to be their own men and make up their own minds on ending the lockout .
To that end , Willis defied union leadership Tuesday and called for players to vote by secret ballot on the owners ' latest offer in hopes of salvaging the season .
" The majority would vote for the owners ' latest proposal , jut to start playing ball again , " Willis said , referring to the deal presented last week by NBA Commissioner David Stern .
While Willis and his agent , Steve Woods , see secret balloting as a way of ending the lockout , union spokesman Dan Wasserman disagreed , saying players still were willing to await the negotiating committee 's recommendation .
The union held a confereence call Monday with about 125 players , who voiced support for the players ' association and chief Billy Hunter .
Agent Jerome Stanley also criticized Woods , who has had a chilly relatonship with the union .
" Tell him to get a life , " Stanley said .
" Don n't harm the body of players in an attempt to enhance yourself . "
