Gullit ' Dedicated to Newcastle '
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Ruud Gullit has hit back at criticism of his commitment to Newcastle and has reaffirmed his loyalty to the club .
The Magpies manager came in for unfavourable press coverage after it emerged he had embarked on a week 's break in the Netherlands and would not be returning until just before the match against Leeds on Saturday .
At Newcastle 's annual meeting on Monday , one shareholder also claimed Gullit spent as much time in Amsterdam as he does on Tyneside .
But in a statement on Wednesday , Gullit said : " I was very sorry to read the stories concerning my visit to Amsterdam on Sunday .
" It is true that up until now , my family has remained in Amsterdam and as a father , I fell it only natural for me to spend a few days at this important time .
" However , I want to assure all Newcastle United supporters that my commitment to the club , its players and of course the fans remains 100 % at all times .
I am totally dedicated to the success of Newcastle . "
Gullit 's reign at St James ' Park has not been the instant success that many predicted when he joined in August following Kenny Dalglish 's departure .
The former Dutch international has found it difficult to recruit the right players and has been unable to field his dream front pair of Alan Shearer and sole signing Duncan Ferguson .
However , Gullit remains upbeat : " I believe I have chosen excellent backroom staff , which enables me to spend a reasonable amount of time searching for new talent to bring to St James ' Park . "
" In fact , in the last 72 hours in particular , I have been in further meetings in Europe with players who we are currently targeting as potential new signings to bolster the squad and mount a serious challenge for honours in the not too distant future . "
At Monday 's meeting , chief executive Freddie Fletcher - in his role as acting chairman of the club 's plc - defended Gullit , insisting : " He works very hard for the club .
He is committed to making Newcastle a successful team . "
The Newcastle United Independent Supporters ' Association secretary , John Regan has also given his full backing to Gullit .
" Kenny Dalglish moved lock , stock and barrel to Newcastle and still ruined the club , so just because the man lives on Tyneside doesn n't mean to say he is good for Newcastle , " he said .
" I think Ruud Gullit is proving to be a very good manager for Newcastle .
" As the board quite rightly said , it 's only a short flight from Amsterdam and Gullit is one of those people who has family commitments and that has to be applauded , " he said .
