S. Africa to Stop Aid to Ailing Gold Mines :
JOHANNESBURG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The South African government has warned that it will not provide financial assistance to ailing gold mines any longer .
Addressing the gold summit here on Thursday , South African Labor Minister Tito Mboweni said : " The gold mines have over the years received numerous direct and indirect subsidies .
Over the years , these have been gradually reduced , and maybe justifiably so . "
" It would be wrong to use tax-payers ' money to artificially maintain production and employment , " he stressed .
But , he said , the government would establish a gold crisis committee in a bid to control down-scaling in the industry before a proposed permanent mining commission was established .
He outlined a six-point government plan , which includes the formation of a gold crisis committee aimed at assisting the trade union and the Chamber of Mines in tackling the crisis , but not replacing the parties ' own efforts .
On the gold crisis committee , the minister said the government was prepared to facilitate an urgent meeting on its composition and terms .
According to the latest estimation by South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) # , 51,000 gold mining workers lost their jobs last year following sustained slump of the gold industry .
The NUM forecast a further fall in employment of between 50,000 and 100,000 this year .
