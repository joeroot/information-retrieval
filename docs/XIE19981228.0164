BANGKOK -- Thailand 's Board of Investment ( BOI ) has approved steps to help existing ventures that need to undergo business rehabilitation , a senior BOI official said .
The steps are a response to requests from the private sector for the BOI to help support business rehabilitation , BOI Deputy Secretary-General Chakramon Pasukvanich said in remarks published by Monday 's Bangkok Post .
For example , companies that need to import additional machinery to restore competitiveness would be able to do so free of tax .
Corporate income tax exemptions will not be extended , however , because most of the ventures are not making enough revenue for paying taxes .
Chakramon said the BOI would also support those new companies to replace existing operations that could not repay debts . ( Thailand-Business Rehabilitation )
