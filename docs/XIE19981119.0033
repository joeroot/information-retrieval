EU Concerned over Chemicals in Circulation
Brussels , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The European Union ( EU ) said here Wednesday that it has adopted a report on findings on the operation of four main EU legal instruments concerning dangerous substances .
The legal instruments govern the classification , packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations , the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances and the restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations .
The instruments ' specific objectives are protection of both human health and environment in the context of the EU internal market .
The assessment identifies a number of issues that need to be addressed with a view to improving their operation .
In general , the findings highlight the need to use the instruments more efficiently and to implement as well as enforce them more rigorously and consistently , the EU Commission said .
The commission prepared the report in the light of public concern about chemicals in circulation in the EU internal market and the discussion of the Environment Ministers at the Informal Council of April 1998 in Chester , Britain .
