Relief Food Reaches Sufferers in S. Somalia
MOGADISHU , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Despite road difficulties created by clan clashes and land mines , the first international food convey has reached southern Somalia stricken by famine , a local official said Monday .
Ali Meris , the Rahwanwein official accompanying the food convoy , said between 4,000 and 5,000 people in 13 villages last Saturday received more than 360 tons of food including maize and lentil .
Besides , 48 tons of nutritious food known as UNIMAX was donated collectively by the United Nations agency for the food program and U.N. Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) .
It took nine days for the food convoy on 32 trucks to reach its destination from Mogadishu to Huddor area in south Somalia .
The food was delivered by the local contracting agency known as Deqa which also provided the trucks and the escorts .
According to a latest report reaching here , the people in Bay and Bakol regions continue dying because of famine and its related diseases such as tuberculosis , severe diarrhoea and malnutrition .
Four children died from famine three days ago .
Hundreds of people are now suffering from marasmus owing to hunger in the region .
This is the first humanitarian response since famine stalked Bay and Bakol regions two months ago after the food shortage precipitated by floods and drought had seriously affected these regions since late last year .
Many other regions in central and southern Somalia are also suffering from the same problem and an estimated people of 700,000 are reportedly facing food shortage .
