ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons took out an insurance policy Monday , when 44-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg , a 16-year veteran , signed a one-year contract with the team .
If DeBerg makes the roster , he will be the oldest player in the NFL .
DeBerg 's signing came after it was learned that Mark Rypien , who had signed a two-year , $ 1.85 million contract to be the backup for Chris Chandler , will not be in Suwanee when training camp begins on July 23 .
Rypien 's football career is on hold because his son , Andrew , is battling brain tumors and his wife , Annette , is fighting a serious illness .
That made it more urgent for the Falcons to sign an experienced backup before their three-day minicamp opened today .
Available veteran free agents included Wade Wilson , David Klingler and Neil O ' Donnell , recently released by the Jets .
But Atlanta decided to sign DeBerg , who last played in 1993 with Tampa Bay ( three games ) and Miami ( five games ) .
He completed 136-of-227 attempts for 1,707 yards and seven touchdowns .
DeBerg played under Falcons coach Dan Reeves in Denver from 1981 - 83 and was his quarterback coach in 1995 - 96 with the Giants .
He is familiar with Reeves ' system and worked out for the Falcons on June 23 .
`` ( Being this close to training camp ) kind of limits you in what you can do , and Steve is one of the few who would fit the bill because he knows the system , '' said Reeves , whose team was 7 - 3 in games Chandler started and finished last year but was 0 - 6 in others .
`` More important is the fact that he worked out really well . ''
DeBerg would supplant Seattle quarterback Warren Moon , 42 , as the NFL 's oldest player .
He ranks 13th in NFL history with 33,872 passing yards , 10th in completions ( 2,844 ) and 11th in attempts ( 4,965 ) .
He played in San Francisco ( 1978 - 80 ) , Denver ( ' 81 - 83 ) , Tampa Bay ( ' 84 - 87 ) , Kansas City ( ' 88 - 91 ) , Tampa Bay again ( ' 92 - 93 ) and Miami ( ' 93 ) .
