NEW YORK CITY BALLET : BEAUTIFUL BODIES AND MYSTERIOUS PRIESTESSES
( lb ) By JACK ANDERSON c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ Jerome Robbins ' `` Afternoon of a Faun , '' a ballet about beautiful bodies , received a beautiful performance when it was offered by the New York City Ballet on Sunday afternoon at the New York State Theater .
What helped make it satisfying was Alexandra Ansanelli 's debut in the role of a dancer who has a brief romantic encounter with another dancer while rehearsing in a studio .
Ms. Ansanelli made her character a young woman who fully realized how attractive she was , and she took delight in admiring her long , flowing hair .
No wonder she caught the eye of Damian Woetzel , who played a dancer otherwise obsessed with contemplating his own image in a mirror .
But when he surprised her with a kiss , Ms. Ansanelli 's expression indicated that this woman was totally unprepared for such attentions .
Both dancers portrayed young people whose bodies had matured more quickly than their emotions .
Robbins was also represented by `` Antique Epigraphs , '' which resembles a series of ancient rituals on some Greek island .
The priestesses on this occasion were Helene Alexopoulos , Maria Kowroski , Riolama Lorenzo and , for the first time in her role , Monique Meunier .
All moved with authority through mysterious ceremonies for which Andrew Lolya served as the flute soloist .
Looking appealingly wistful , Miranda Weese made her debut as a visionary figure adored by Jock Soto in Peter Martins ' `` Symphonic Dances . ''
But the ballet , which gets off to a stormy start , soon grows long-winded and aimless .
Ms. Weese 's lyricism was better displayed in a repeat performance of George Balanchine 's `` Divertimento No. 15 , '' which opened the program , conducted by Hugo Fiorato .
