CHOOSING THE RIGHT BRIQUETTE FOR YOUR GRILL

ALBANY , N.Y .
_ About 75 percent of U.S. households have a barbecue grill , according to the Barbecue Industry Association .
With convenient cart-type covered grills , more than half of Americans now cook outside year-round .
The Northeast leads the heavy-barbecuer category , which means barbecuing four or more times a month .
Gas grills are widely used now .
Charcoal briquettes , which were invented after World War II by automotive entrepreneur Henry Ford , are a matter of preference .
( Ford took wood left over from making cars and ground and pressed it into briquettes , which were often sold at car dealers , so early motorists could stop and cook lunch along the road . )
Today there are a number of instant-light or light-the-bag products for those who prefer cooking over charcoal .
Natural lump charcoal costs a bit more than charcoal briquettes , but it burns hotter , requires fewer lumps and partially burned natural lump charcoal can be reused .
Briquettes work better for long cooking periods , because they produce more consistent heat .
Rather than totally charcoal , briquettes are made of powdered charcoal from tree bark , sawdust and scrap lumber and mixed with petroleum extracts , limestone , sodium nitrate and borax to aid in shaping and lighting .
Instant-light charcoal is impregnated with lighter fluid and instant-light wood products have nontoxic wax incorporated as a lighting medium .
Briquettes or wood chunks packed in a single-use waxed bag , which is set on fire , are convenient for tailgating and picnics , since they are easy to handle and leave nothing to cart home afterward .
Natural lump hardwood charcoal , which contains no additives or fillers , is making a comeback as it burns 250 times cleaner and at 100 hotter than briquettes .
It is especially desirable for fast-cooking foods like fish , burgers and boneless chicken breasts .
Lump charcoal also is ready for grilling in 10 minutes , as it is just shy of being pure carbon .
Briquettes take about 20 minutes .
Lump hardwood charcoal , however , is considerably more expensive than briquettes .
The difference between expensive lump hardwood charcoal and briquettes is the extra fillers and lighting compounds that are added to the cheaper briquettes .
Also , some briquettes burn better than others depending on their respective additives , and prices vary .
A recent study this year by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , Calif. , said that marinating meat before grilling can reduce the production of heterocyclic aromatic amines , or HAAs , which have been linked to cancer in animals .
For years scientists have warned against eating too much barbecued meat for this reason .
Another caution : Burning charcoal inside your home , vehicle or tent , can be dangerous .
Burning charcoal gives off carbon monoxide , which has no odor .
