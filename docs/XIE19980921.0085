Lesotho on Brink of Anarchy
JOHANNESBURG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Lesotho stood on the brink of anarchy Sunday night as the opposition alliance called a stayaway from Monday which would last " until the government is in the hands of the people " , South African media reported Monday .
A spokesperson for the opposition , Sekwalo Tolwane , said they were no longer interested in talking to the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy ( LCD ) after the absence of the LCD from a series of meetings Sunday brokered by South Africa , Botswana and Zimbabwe .
The LCD refused to talk directly to the alliance , and South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi 's shuttle diplomacy failed to produce any results .
Opposition leaders waited for more than two hours as Mufamadi tried to convince the ruling party to come to the talks .
Thousands of opposition supporters who had gathered in Maseru for a report-back were disillusioned and angry after it was reported that the ruling party was not interested in meeting their leaders .
The meetings were proposed after the release of a report by a three-nation commission to look into opposition allegations that the May 23 general elections in the mountain kingdom were rigged in favor of the LCD .
The report said there were irregularities in the elections , but failed to say for sure that they were rigged .
After the release of the report , the government led by Pakalitha Mosisili refused to step down .
The capital Maseru was teeming with thousands of opposition supporters demanding the resignation of the government .
Senior LCD members were afraid to venture into the capital , which has become a no-go zone for them because of the six-week protest outside King Letsie III 's palace .
Twenty senior military officers have fled to Ladybrand in South Africa 's Free State where they have been sheltered since last week .
The sound of gunfire has been heard over the past few nights , and drunken armed soldiers have often harassed motorists .
Civil servants have been barred from entering their offices and government members are unable to use the parliamentary buildings from which they have been barred by protesters .
