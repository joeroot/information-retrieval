66 Killed , 215 Injured in Kabul Rocket Attacks
ISLAMABAD , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- At least 66 people were killed and another 215 wounded in Kabul rocket attacks Sunday by the forces loyal to former Afghan defense minister Ahmed Shah Masood .
Reports reaching here Monday from Kabul said that the anti-Taliban forces launched three rounds of heavy rocket attack on residential areas of Kabul Sunday , the first hitting a populated area called Khairkhana , the second and third hitting a shopping center and a cinema respectively .
Around 50 people died late Sunday when a heavy missile hit a shopping center in the western area of Karte Parwarn , three hours after another rocket killed at least 16 people in Khairkhana in the north .
The reports quoted hospital sources as saying that they had so far received 36 bodies and more than 200 wounded from the two attacks .
It is believed that the rocket attacks were carried out by the anti-Taliban forces as a retaliation to the indiscriminate bombing by the Taliban jet fighters on Wardag province on September 19 .
One report quoted a Taliban policeman as saying in Kabul it was difficult to know the exact number of victims , but casualties could be " disastrous " as the market was crowded during the evening shopping hours .
