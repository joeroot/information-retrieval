CONCERT MARS GIANTS STADIUM GRASS
( mk ) By BILL PENNINGTON c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
When they grew grass over the artificial turf last year at Giants Stadium , a mysterious fungus seeped onto the artificial field and ultimately destroyed it .
This year , on a grass field grown over a new , million-dollar replacement artificial turf , the Giants and Jets have looked forward to playing three exhibition games _ a grand experiment that could lead to both teams eventually playing on a permanent grass field .
Not so fast .
The multipurpose-field blues have struck again at Giants Stadium .
The fake grass on the stadium floor is fine .
This time , it 's the real grass that 's hurting .
A concert held at the stadium in East Rutherford , N.J . , over the weekend turned large swaths of the grass _ which is suspended over the artificial turf on 6,100 portable trays _ a sickly yellow .
Giants president John Mara said he observed other damage : brown tire track imprints caused by forklifts that were used to set up the concert stage .
On the eve of Saturday 's first Giants preseason game at Giants Stadium , workmen prepared to paint the usual gridiron stripes and hash marks as they simultaneously labored to mask five wide , yellow stripes crisscrossing the field .
`` I have to say the field doesn n't look very good right now , '' Mara said .
Scott Clark , whose company installed and maintains the grass field , said , `` It got trashed . ''
`` What more bad luck can you have there ? ''
Clark said with a laugh .
`` If something can go wrong , it has . ''
But the stadium 's general manager , Tim Hassett , had a different perspective .
`` It 's not a surprise to anybody here , '' he said .
`` The reason nobody has gone to grass in Giants Stadium is because there 's been no system that anyone believed could withstand the level of stress our field has to go through .
`` It 's an experiment and Scott Clark feels he can make it work .
I think it 's going fine so far .
Everyone can say the field looks lousy now , but wait until Saturday .
Wait until the exhibition football games and the two or three soccer games have been played .
We 'll judge how this works out in the end . ''
First , of course , there 's the marching band competition Thursday night at Giants Stadium .
The current grass field was installed to allow the MetroStars of Major League Soccer to play their games on grass .
It will be removed before the Giants ' and Jets ' regular seasons begin , and was supposed to be dismantled before the pro football exhibition season .
But after the Giants practiced on the grass field in the stadium this spring , players , coaches and the team 's management were eager to try playing a few exhibition games on the field as an experiment .
There were no complications to this arrangement until Sunday 's Budweiser Superfest concert , a performance of several musical acts headlined by the singer Patti LaBelle .
The concert was attended by 7,000 people .
But it was the stage assembly and its dismantling that harmed the grass .
Plywood was placed across the grass to create wooden roads so that 5,000-pound forklifts could carry pieces of the steel stage from trucks in the surrounding parking lots to the middle of the field .
The plywood remained on the grass for eight to 10 hours a day from Thursday until Monday .
`` If you covered parts of your lawn with plywood for even a day , it would turn a different color , '' Hassett said .
`` There 's no way to prevent that .
The field wasn n't trashed , and they placed the plywood right where they were told to place it . ''

Clark suggested that if there were ever a permanent grass field inside Giants Stadium , certain kinds of concerts would not be scheduled near the football season .
`` You live and learn , '' he said .
In the meantime , Clark hopes to make the field acceptable by Saturday and for the other games at the stadium this month .
`` If we can turn the field from very bad to acceptable _ and host a marching band competition in the midst of all that , '' Clark said , `` it 'll show some ability to make this work .
This is the worst-case scenario and we 're probably going to make it , so it looks OK .
`` But it certainly isn n't going to be as good as it should be . ''
Mara said : `` I think we 're all hoping the field holds up , but this is precisely the type of thing that we have to do if we 're going to know if grass will work in Giants Stadium .
Are they going to be able to maintain the field given the number of events the facility hosts ? ''
Clark and Mara said it was premature to speculate that Giants Stadium would have a permanent grass field by next year or even the year after , regardless of how the current trial period plays out .
`` The day is coming for that , '' Clark said .
`` But we won n't do it until we know it will work .
This is another first step .
The real proof will be the Giants-Jets exhibition game Aug. 20 .
`` How will the field look then _ after this concert , after three football games , three soccer games and a marching band competition ?
That 's when we 'll know . ''
Mara made a final , especially appropriate point given the recent history of the Giants Stadium playing surface .
`` If we can develop a field that will work in Giants Stadium , '' he said , `` then people will know it can work anywhere . ''
