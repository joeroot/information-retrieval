U.S. Worries About Violence in Kosovo
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States said Wednesday that several violent incidents in Kosovo over the last week have increased tension and threaten to reignite hostilities .
The U.S. State Department renewed an appeal for restraint on both sides .
State Department spokesman James Rubin cited indications that some Serb security personnel withdrawn in October have returned to the embattled Serbian province and military and police units that are supposed to be in garrison are deployed in the field .
The United States has strongly condemned violent actions linked to ethnic Albanian militants belonging to the Kosovar Liberation Army .
Meanwhile , Rubin said the United States also is worried about the " disproportionate and heavy-handed response " of the Serb security forces .
" A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population of Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and could spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the cease-fire agreement , " he said .
