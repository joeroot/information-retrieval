Most Asian Markets Gain Relative Calm : HKMA
HONG KONG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Most Asian financial markets " gained relative calm " in late January and early February , said a Hong Kong Monetary Authority ( HKMA ) publication , which was released here Friday .
In a regular review of Hong Kong 's external environment , the publication noted , the seemingly Asian market stabilization followed favorable announcements relating to the external debt resolution in South Korea and Indonesia , and the removal of exchange control in Thailand .
" Although the region still has many domestic economic problems to solve before investors ' confidence can be fully restored , there are signs of some recovery , especially on the trade front , " the February 1998 HKMA Quarterly Bulletin noted .
By January , Thailand had seen five consecutive months of trade surpluses .
Malaysia also had trade surpluses since November last year , said the Quarterly .
The improvement of trade balance is believed to be one of the five major factors contributing to the stabilization of the Asian financial markets .
As the Quarterly claimed , there are signs that export recovery and import compression will turn the current account deficit from 4.7 percent of GDP in 1996 to surplus within 1998 .
" This would generate a net inflow of foreign exchange to compensate for recent capital outflows , thus providing a stabilizing influence on exchange rates , " it said .
The second favorable factor should be China 's robust economic growth amid the regional turmoil and its unequivocal commitment not to devalue its currency , Renminbi , which have " provided much-needed stability " to the region .
The currency and financial stability on the Chinese mainland should benefit Hong Kong , which is economically integrated with the mainland , while going a longer way to help the region weather the financial turmoil , the HKMA publication said .
Also bringing relief and boosting investors ' confidence in the region are factors such as the stability of the Japanese yen , the international community 's willingness to rollover credit for Asian countries , and a greater determination by Asia to implement reforms under International Monetary Fund conditionality , the Quarterly added .
