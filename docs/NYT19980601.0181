FORGET THE JOE JINX ; STARS SEE HOW ` WE CAN BEAT THESE GUYS '
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By MIKE HEIKA c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
DETROIT _ With just a shade of curiosity in his mind after Friday 's 5 - 3 Stars ' loss to the Detroit Red Wings , coach Ken Hitchcock skated up to defenseman Craig Ludwig at practice yesterday and asked to check the team 's pulse .
`` I told him that after the team meal , 10 or 12 of us were sitting around and the feeling is that , yes , we can beat these guys , '' Ludwig said .
`` And I think a lot of it came from that game ( Friday ) night .
Even though we lost , we gained a lot of confidence from what we were able to do against them . ''
The Stars will need that confidence heading into Game 4 today on the same Joe Louis Arena ice where they are carrying a 1 - 15-2 record in their past 18 appearances .
And with the Wings holding a 2 - 1 edge in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals , the Stars realize that they are in a dire situation once again _ in jeopardy of falling behind 3 - 1.
`` It 's a lot like Game 2 , '' Hitchcock said .
`` We 're not in an elimination situation , but a loss would make it very tough . ''
Still , the Stars ' coach said he believes that the team is halfway toward a victory , overcoming the key mental hurdle he perceived was blocking the players in their battle with the defending Stanley Cup champions .
He said he no longer feels the Stars `` have stopped believing they can win in this building , '' as he said before Game 3.
`` Our team has gained a lot of confidence , '' Hitchcock said .
`` We 've played two strong hockey games ( against the Red Wings ) , we 've won one and we 've lost one .
But we 've shown we can play at the same level . ''
In the Game 3 loss , the Stars outshot the Red Wings 34 - 20 and complained that three of the Red Wings ' goals never should have happened .
Wings winger Brent Gilchrist used a high stick to play a puck en route to his goal _ a move that should have stopped play , Hitchcock said .
The coach added that referee Terry Gregson blew a call when he failed to blow the whistle on a delayed penalty , leading to Jamie Macoun 's goal .
And Stars goalie Ed Belfour said Martin Lapointe slashed him outside of the crease to set up the final goal _ one that broke the back of the hard-charging Stars , who had climbed back from a 4 - 0 deficit to make the score 4 - 3.
And while they could have come off as whiners , while they could have said the `` Jinx of The Joe '' was haunting them , the players yesterday said a series of bad hops and missed opportunities only strengthened their resolve .
`` There were a couple of bad bounces that ended up in our net , '' defenseman Richard Matvichuk said .
`` Otherwise , we proved that we can play with this team , that we can play better than this team and that we can beat this team . ''
Players and coaches underscored they can do that while playing the aggressive , offensive-minded style that they used in Game 3.
`` We can play that style , we 've done it all year , '' said captain Derian Hatcher , in references to the Stars ' two previous playoff series .
`` We played our best against San Jose when we pushed hard , and we played our best against Edmonton when we pushed hard .
In that last game , we didn n't give up goals because we were forechecking hard , we gave up goals because we were cheating defensively . ''
Hatcher said that problem is easily remedied by increasing focus and intensity .
Both will be needed .
The Stars will likely be without defenseman Shawn Chambers , who has a sprained knee , and winger Greg Adams , who is expected to be out with a sore neck .
Hitchcock said to expect defenseman Craig Muni and winger Jamie Wright stepping into the lineup .
With those changes and some shuffled lines that include the reuniting of Jamie Langenbrunner , Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen , Hitchcock said the Stars ' leaders need to step up .
And while he didn n't name names , it 's not difficult to pick out names like Modano , Pat Verbeek , Sergei Zubov and Benoit Hogue .
`` The key for us winning is we still don n't have everyone drawn in '' to believing , Hitchcock said .
`` We have some key performers who have to muster up and play with a higher level of determination . ''
But if history is any indication , the Stars should respond with a spirited performance today .
Ludwig said .
The Stars won a huge game in Texas after the Sharks had pushed the series to 2 - 2.
They went to Edmonton and swept the Oilers there after splitting games in Texas .
`` I don n't know why , but we always seem to play better when we have our backs to the wall , '' Ludwig said .
`` Maybe that shows the character of this team .
We have guys here who care , we have guys here who believe in ourselves and who believe in our system . ''
And frankly , the Red Wings are starting to buy in , as well .
`` To be honest with you , '' the Wings ' Macoun said after Game 3 , `` they probably deserved to win . ''
See , this believing thing is really catching on .
