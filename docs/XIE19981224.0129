Central China to Shut Down 2,000 Coal Mines
ZHENGZHOU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Central China 's Henan Province , China 's second largest coal producer , will shut down more than 2,000 small coal mines as part of the nationwide effort to curb the over-production of coal resources .
Li Jiucheng , deputy director of the Henan Provincial Coal Department , said Henan will reduce its annual coal output by 20 million tons through these shutdowns .
These small mines , which have neither mining permits nor required safety standards , have hampered the development of large state-owned mines , the official said .
Henan is rich in coal resources , but excessive mining would be sure to bring serious problems , he added .
Many coal mines , small private ones in particular , have sprung up over the last two decades since China launched the campaign of reform and opening up to the outside world .
However , negative consequences such as resource waste , environmental pollution and accidents have also occurred because of ill-considered and random mining .
Moreover , the blind development of small mines aggravates an already oversupplied coal market , he noted .
