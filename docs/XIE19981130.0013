UK 's Royal Family Agrees to Give Up Seats in House of Lords
LONDON , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Britain 's royal family has agreed that it will not fight to keep its right to sit and vote in the House of Lords when the government reforms the unelected upper house .
A government spokesman said the royal household had told the government that members of the family , which has been included in the House of Lords since it was set up 900 years ago , would " fall into line " with the government 's plans and give up its seats with out a fight if the legislation announced in the Queen 's Speech last week is passed .
" We have been informed the royal family accepts the decision and the dukes would no longer have the right to sit , " said the spokesman .
Prince Charles , first in line to the throne , his brother Prince Andrew and Prince Philip , Queen Elizabeth 's husband , all have a right to vote in the upper chamber , although they rarely do .
The government spokesman said they made clear they want no special arrangements after the reform .
The deal , which follows months of negotiations between the government and the Palace , shows the lengths to which the government is prepared to go in its drive to reform the House of Lords .
The government will be relieved it does not have to face an unseemly row with the royal family , the major beneficiaries of the same hereditary principle the government wants to scrap in the upper chamber .
