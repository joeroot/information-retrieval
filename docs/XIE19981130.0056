Kazakhstan Seeks Air Links With Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Kazakhstan has expressed its desire to establish air links with Malaysia to forge closer ties and improve trade relations between the two countries , Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Monday .
Malaysia welcomed such a proposal but due to the current economic slowdown , the government would have to keep the matter in view , he said after receiving a trade delegation from Kazakhstan here Monday .
Malaysia is prepared to make a study on the route but it is not likely that air links with the former Soviet republic could be establish soon , he said .
Ling said the establishment of an air link is important to businessmen as this would create a business link and could help " business bloom " among businessmen of the two countries .
Trade between Malaysia and Kazakhstan from January to September this year stood at 11 million ringgit ( 2.894 million U.S. dollars ) with exports from Malaysia amounting to 9.9 million ringgit ( 2.605 million U.S. dollars ) and imports 1.1 million ringgit ( 289,000 U.S. dollars ) .
