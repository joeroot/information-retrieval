Tamil Parties Oppose Appointment of New Governor
COLOMBO , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Several Sri Lankan Tamil political parties have condemned the appointment of Asoka Jayawardane , a just-retired army officer , as the new governor of the North-East Provincial Council .
A Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization spokesman said Jayawardane 's appointment showed that the government was tilting towards military rule in the east , informed sources said Sunday .
Tamil Congress leader Kumar Ponnambalam said it showed the government wanted a military and not a political solution .
The Eelam People 's revolution liberation Front 's sources also said that the appointment suggests that the government prefers a military administration rather than a civil administration in the northeast .
A Ceylon Worker 's Congress spokesman said the appointment was a continuation of the militarization of the northeast , the sources added .
Major General Asoka Jayawardane , who retired last week as deputy chief of staff of the Sri Lankan Army , was Friday named Governor of the North-East by President Chandrika Kumaratunga .
