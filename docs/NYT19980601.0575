LEGISLATORS OPPOSE WHITMAN MOVE TO HIKE GASOLINE TAX

TRENTON , N.J .
_ Gov. Christie Whitman faces growing opposition in the state Legislature over her proposal to raise the gasoline tax by 7 cents a gallon to help finance improvements in transportation and preserve open space .
State Sen. Richard Codey , the Democratic leader , said Monday that the Senate 's 16 Democrats would not support the tax increase .
Several top Republicans in the Legislature have also expressed reservations , saying a gasoline tax increase should not be used for open space .
Without bipartisan support , it is unlikely that the governor 's proposal will win enough votes to get on the ballot in November .
But Whitman aides said they remained confident that the plan would get legislative approval .
`` We believe that achieving funding for transportation projects and finding a stable source of revenue for open space preservation are still achievable , '' said Whitman 's press secretary , Jayne O ' Connor .
At a news conference Monday afternoon , Codey said he would support a bond referendum in the fall to preserve open space .
In the last 37 years , New Jersey voters have approved nine similar bond referendums , raising $ 1.39 billion to help protect more than 400,000 acres of farmland and other land from development .
He said he did not think a gasoline tax increase for transportation projects was necessary now .
`` We 've just approved putting some money back in the pockets of drivers with automobile insurance reform , '' said Codey , D-West Orange .
`` But now Governor Whitman wants to take it away even before the savings arrive . ''
In an interview Monday , state Sen. Robert Littell , a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , said he would consider raising the gasoline tax for transportation projects , but not for open space preservation .
He said he supported alternate proposals in the Legislature to raise money to buy undeveloped land in the state , including a bill that would dedicate a quarter of a percent of existing sales tax revenue for land purchases .
He also said he would go along with putting another bond referendum before the voters in November .
For Whitman to get her proposal on the ballot this fall , she would need a three-fifths vote of the Legislature : 48 votes in the Assembly and 24 in the Senate .
Without the support of Littell and the 16 Democrats , she would have only 23 votes in the Senate .
Whitman has called for 5 cents of the proposed 7-cent-a-gallon increase to be used for transportation improvements and 2 cents for the purchase of one million acres , about half of the remaining undeveloped land in the state , during the next 10 years .
The increase would raise the state 's gasoline tax , the lowest in the region , to 21.5 cents a gallon from 14.5 cents .
`` The reason why I talked about an increase in the gasoline tax going on the ballot is because I want to see it constitutionally dedicated so that money raised won n't go to other things , '' Whitman said after learning about Codey 's remarks .
`` What it means if we do not identify a funding source is that we are not able to preserve land , and we lose 10,000 acres a year in this state .
We are losing land every day , and it is important that if we care about open space that we act now . ''
The plan 's fate is uncertain in the Assembly as well .
Assemblyman Alex DeCroce , a Republican who is chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee , said he did not believe that a portion of a gasoline tax increase should be used for open space preservation , but that he had not yet decided whether he would support the governor 's proposal .
`` I have never wanted to see motor vehicle taxes diverted for any reason other than transportation issues , '' DeCroce said .
