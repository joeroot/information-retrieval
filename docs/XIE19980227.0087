Jansher Enters Final Four in Super Series
LONDON , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Jansher Khan ensured a place in the semi-finals of the eight-man Super Series Final by beating Del Harris of Britain 15 - 7 , 15 - 9 here on Friday .
Harris , the Super Series champion two years ago , who had upset Jansher en route to the 1996 title , enjoyed no upperhands this time against Jansher in the control of the ball .
After mistiming a drive and conceding a penalty stroke at 4 - 2 in the second game , Harris thumped the perspex with his hand , making the wall shudder , and no longer appeared to have the strength of mind to stay in contention .
The defending champion Jansher had pulled through in the opening round-robin match after saving two matches points to defeat Mark Chaloner , the world number 11 from England .
