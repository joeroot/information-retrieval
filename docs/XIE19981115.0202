U.S. Says Iraqi Offer for Comply Unacceptable
WASHINGTON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States said Saturday that Iraq 's offer to allow the U.N. inspections to resume is " unacceptable " because it is conditional .
The U.S. will consult with its allies to consider next steps , said National Security Council advisor Sandy Berger at a news conference at the White House .
" There certainly is not unlimited time " for Iraq to comply , Berger said .
It needed to give a " clear statement that they will fully comply " with U.N. weapons inspections .
Berger said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has had " plenty of opportunity to demonstrate that he 's prepared to come back in compliance " with U.N. demands that he has disposed of his weapons of mass destruction .
He said the U.S. remains poised to take military action against Iraq .
Berger made the statement at the White House after a more than five-hour session of President clinton 's national security advisers .
Earlier , U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to stay home to deal with the Iraqi crisis instead of going to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) meeting .
White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart made the statement after an emergency meeting of the U.S. Presidential National Security Council at the White House over an earlier Iraqi decision to resume cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors .
Vice President Al Gore will attend the APEC meeting , which is to be convened in Malaysia .
Clinton , who is supposed to leave at 10 : 00 EST Saturday night " hopes " to complete the remainder of the trip which includes stops in Japan , South Korea and the U.S. territory of Guam , Lockhart said .
The U.S. reaction means that the crisis is still not over .
Pentagon sources said that actually the Pentagon has already issued the order to attack Iraq with cruise missiles .
But it was delayed after Iraq made the promise to comply .
Earlier , the Iraqi authorities announced that it will accept U.N. weapons inspections to resume without conditions and inspectors would be allowed to return immediately .
The Clinton administration made it clear that the Iraqi compliance should be unconditional and full , or face serious consequences .
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that the Iraqi promise is unconditional and met all the requirements of the U.N. Security Council resolutions .
Meanwhile , the first wave of additional U.S. warplanes left for the Gulf this morning : six B-52 heavy bombers departed Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana , at 4 : 38 a.m. EST .
The aircraft were to be followed shortly by F-15s , F-16s , and other B-1 bombers from bases across the country , Air Force spokeswoman Wendy Frable said .
