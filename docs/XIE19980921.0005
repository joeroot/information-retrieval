News Analysis : All Eyes Set on " 6 + 2 " Meeting on Afghanistan
ISLAMABAD , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- All eyes are set on the " six-plus-two " ministerial meeting called by the United Nations in New York on Monday as Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz apparently failed to help defuse the prevailing tension on the Iran-Afghan border during his latest mission to Tehran .
The meeting to be held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session Monday afternoon will be attended by six of Afghanistan 's neighbors , namely Iran , Pakistan , Tajikstan , Turkmanistan , Uzbekistan and China plus Russia and the United States .
It is the first such ministerial-level meeting under the U.N . - sponsored formula , under which lower-ranking officials of these countries have met occasionally since the end of last year in a bid to end the protracted Afghan conflict .
The forthcoming " six-plus-two " moot is crucial as the stand-off between Iran and the Taliban militia , triggered by the murder of seven Iranian diplomats in northern Afghanistan last month , poses a threat to the peace and security of the region .
Declaring that it reserves the right of taking any action to revenge , the Iranian government has already amassed 200,000 troops near the Iran-Afghan border , equipped with tanks , heavy artillery , helicopters and armored personnel carriers .
To counter the Iranian military build-up , the Taliban have also reinforced their military position along their common border , warning that they will attack Iranian cities with missiles if Tehran initiates any military action against them .
As a consequence of this spiraling tension , the outbreak of an Iran-Afghan war has emerged as a distinct possibility .
Meanwhile , despite Pakistan 's repeated denials , Iran insists that Islamabad is actively involved on the side of the Taliban in Afghanistan and is also responsible for the " abhorrent killings " of the Iranian diplomats .
Most significantly , Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a dire warning to the Taliban and Pakistan that their actions in Afghanistan could provoke a regional conflict .
In a message broadcast on state radio and television on September 14 , Khamenei said : " I have ...
so far prevented the lighting of a fire in this region which could be hard to extinguish .
But all should know that a very great and wide danger is quite near . "
On September 17 , Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz paid an unscheduled fence-mending visit to Tehran but it seems that he has cut no ice with the Iranian government .
He was reported to have brought a letter from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , but was unable to deliver it to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who was not available in Tehran .
By all accounts , as commented by Pakistan 's major newspaper The News , Aziz heard tough talk from the Iranian leaders he met and was issued an unambiguous warning about the " darkening " in ties between the two countries and about the growing popular pressure in Iran to use the military option against the Taliban .
Against such a backdrop , analysts here noted that the U.N. Secretary General 's move to call a six-plus-two conference has assumed greater importance because this will entail direct talks between all the countries which are directly affected by the Afghan crisis .
If common sense prevails , the eight powers who meet in New York should agree on a policy of non-interference in Afghanistan and endeavor to pave the way for a new all-party peace dialogue in the war-torn country , they said .
Particularly , they added that one hopes that the leaders of Pakistan and Iran , the two most important players in the Afghan peace process , will reach some understanding on how the Afghan crisis is to be handled .
