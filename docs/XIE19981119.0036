Israel , Palestine Resume Final Status Talks
JERUSALEM , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli and Palestinian officials resumed in Jerusalem Wednesday the final status talks on contentious issues such as the fate of Jerusalem .
The talks between Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas , came one day after Israel 's parliament ratified the Wye peace accord by a landslide majority .
Other sensitive issues to be resolved in the final talks include Jewish settlements , the Palestinian refugees , and the final borders between Israel and a possible Palestinian state .
Abbas said to the press the actual negotiations will probably begin in a week or ten days .
" About the permanent agreement , I hope we can reach one as early as possible , " Sharon said .
" We will look ahead to see how to be able to find a way for a lasting peace in the Middle East , " he added .
Pursuant to the timetable of the Oslo agreement signed in 1993 , Israel and Palestine entered the final status talks in May , 1996 .
But soon after a symbolic launch , the talks were stillborn with the election of the Likud government in Israel in the same month .
The Wye accord , which was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat last month , stipulated that the two sides should start the permanent talks as soon as the deal went into effect .
