Russian Atomic Energy Minister Arrives in Iran
TEHRAN , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov arrived here Saturday to inspect the Bushehr nuclear plant which is under construction with Russia 's cooperation .
Upon his arrival , Adamov said that his three-day visit was aimed at reviewing the work carried out in constructing the 1,000-megawatt Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran , the official news agency IRNA reported .
He said the cooperation between the two countries should expand to other fields from the nuclear sector .
Meanwhile , Iranian Vice President Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Iran and Russia have removed ambiguities on the construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant following talks between officials of the two countries .
Without elaborating the ambiguities , Aqazadeh , also head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , said that Tehran and Moscow not only solved problems relating to the Bushehr nuclear plants , but also paved the way for cooperation in other fields such as health and industries .
Some Iranian officials earlier expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of construction and urged Russia to speed it up .
Following a series of talks , Moscow assured Iran that it would hand over the nuclear plant to Tehran for operation next year .
Russia concluded the contract on the Bushehr nuclear plant with Iran in 1994 , defying the U.S. pressure against cooperation on the project .
Washington warned that any kind of nuclear assistance to Iran could aid Iran 's alleged nuclear weapons plans .
However , Russia has argued that the plant is purely for peaceful purposes while Iran has also denied that it is seeking nuclear weapons .
