Looking for Laughs in the Right Places
NEW YORK _ Jackie Mason was clutching a microphone and addressing the balding gentleman in the first row , something he has been known to do before .
`` Mister , would I ever be so tasteless as to tell a Viagra joke ?
Because , mister , I 'm not the kind of comedian that would use that lowlife type of material . ''
The man laughed , waiting for the inevitable skewering .
He was surrounded by an audience of comedy mavens at Catch a Rising Star on West 28th St. , where , unannounced , Mason is performing each evening though Thursday .
It is the first time that Mason has appeared at a comedy club in New York since he played Dangerfield 's back in the late 1970s .
`` But mister , I want to ask you a Viagra question , '' said Mason .
`` Can you answer me this ?
What happens when a man like you takes Viagra _ and then the girl changes her mind ? ''
Mason is tuning up his next Broadway show , the fifth since 1986 , in the way he always has : trying out new material `` and seeing if what I say stinks up the joint , '' Mason said before the show .
For six months now he 's been working on new material at clubs in Las Vegas , Chicago and Houston , `` but there is nothing like a New York audience for judging whether a comedian is a hero or some kind of lowlife individual , '' he said happily .
Paris to New York , Via Casablanca
NEW YORK _ There were some guests at a dinner given by Bill Richardson , the U.S. representative to the United Nations , who bragged about the trans-Atlantic commuting they had to do last week .
They went to Paris for a Tuesday night dinner-dance for the 70th birthday of Ambassador Felix Rohatyn ( and his son Pierre 's 40th ) , then back to New York on Thursday for the Richardson gathering , which honored & UR ; & LR ; Alan Greenspan , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , and his wife , Andrea Mitchell of NBC News .
Roger Altman , the investment banker and former deputy treasury secretary , was seen at both parties .
So was Henry Kissinger , the former secretary of state , who celebrated his own 75th birthday on Wednesday , the day between the two parties .
The Rohatyns ' residence on the Faubourg St. Honore had been decorated to look like Rick 's Cafe Americain in the film `` Casablanca . ''
The invitations featured a doctored photograph , with the senior Rohatyn 's head where Humphrey Bogart 's was .
Out and About , Eastern Edition
EAST HAMPTON , N.Y .
_ Michael Douglas ordered a $ 60 tasting menu at Pacific East , an Asian restaurant in East Hampton , N.Y .
The chef , Michael Castino , said the five-course , 2,000-calorie meal included tuna tartare , lobster pancakes , Chilean sea bass and soft-shelled crab tempura .
Douglas also ordered a dessert called the `` chocolate bomb '' and an after-dinner cigar .
Steven Gaines , author of `` Philistines at the Hedgerow : Passion and Property in the Hamptons '' ( Little , Brown ) , was working the room at Nick and Toni 's , also in East Hampton , on Saturday .
But there was a problem .
`` It was a light night celebrity-wise , '' said a man who works for Nick and Toni 's , and there were not many hands to shake or backs to slap .
Gaines did greet two chefs from Manhattan who were visiting ( and eating , not cooking ) : Alfred Portale of the Gotham Bar and Grill , and Bobby Flay from Mesa and Bolo .
