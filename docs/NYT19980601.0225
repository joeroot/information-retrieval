BRUSHING UP YOUR STRIDE
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By CAROL BIDWELL c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES _ & UR ; & LR ; How can you tell if you 're walking properly ?
Take a look in the mirror .
Do you lean to one side ?
Are your shoulders straight ?
Do you lead with your head ?
Your hips ?
Or take a walk barefoot on wet sand .
Do your heels sink in evenly ?
Or is there a deeper depression on the outside of your foot , or the inside ?
Does your foot make a print like Donald Duck 's , or is the arch clearly delineated ?
Here are some other suggestions , from Sherry Brourman 's book `` Walk Yourself Well '' ( Hyperion ; $ 22.95 ) :
Lengthen your stride so you can feel muscles in legs and buttocks working .
Short steps keep you off-balance .
Don n't walk leaning back .
Don n't lead with your hips or your head .
Keep your feet straight , not letting your ankles roll inward .
Each heel should strike at the midpoint , not closer to either edge .
You should be able to feel the muscles in your feet as you walk .
Use your toes to push off and start the next step .
Keep your stance as wide as your shoulders to keep from wobbling , which puts stress on your knees .
As you walk , keep your feet turned out only a little ; 15 to 20 degrees is way too far and forces you to lean back to maintain your balance .
Keep your knees flexible , not locked , as you walk and stand to minimize stress on those joints .
Shift your weight from hip to hip as you walk .
Your knees aren n't car headlights and shouldn n't point straight ahead ; they should be turned outward a little .
Swing your arms as you walk to help propel yourself ; palms should be toward your body , thumbs pointing ahead .
Untuck your buns and hold your belly in .
Keep your head up and back .
