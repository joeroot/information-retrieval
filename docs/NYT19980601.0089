I don n't usually hand out bold advice I wouldn n't take myself .
Still , I was glad to hear the Manhattan Theater Club of New York City , which has a reputation for presenting new plays and talent , has decided to go ahead with a touchy play after getting threats said to come from Catholic extremists .
The play was fated for controversy .
Details are sketchy .
The New York Times hears the play is about 13 gay men celebrating the passion of Christ and sex is involved .
Furious protests arrived punctually , threatening death to playwright , theater staff and actors .
The play was canceled , then reinstated a week later after intellectuals squawked censorship .
Catholics are hardly alone in objecting when values are affronted .
Name an ethnic or religious group , and you 'll find an insult that can not be trivialized out of existence .
Blacks , the Irish , the churched and unchurched , Jews , women , Asians , Hispanics , gays , you name it , have lines that can not be crossed .
And the lines are movable , one person 's insult being another 's political correctness .
I would not find a jolly parody of Auschwitz a liberating aesthetic experience .
As a response , violence raises the stakes far too many notches .
Art is judged by its content and moral underpinnings .
If playwright Terrence McNally has gone too far , he will be found out , and rejected in the marketplace .
The only lesson to be learned as things now stand is that someone has invented the ultimate heckler 's veto .
