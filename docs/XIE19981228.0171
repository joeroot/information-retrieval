Indian Govt to Share Half Loss in Public Stocks Sale
NEW DELHI , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- India 's Finance Ministry has agreed to bear 50 percent of any losses incurred by financial institutions while offloading warehoused stocks of public sector undertakings ( PSUs ) in the capital market , the ministry 's officials said here Monday .
The government has also agreed not to dilute its stakes in the PSUs after the shares are sold to the financial institutions , and no fresh float will be made till the shares picked up by the financial institutions are sold in the market .
These were agreed during a recent meeting between the chiefs of leading financial institutions and the Finance Ministry here in connection with sale of PSUs ' stocks to financial institutions .
Earlier , Finance Minister Yashwant Singh instructed the financial institutions to take PSUs ' stocks worth 50 billion rupees ( 1.17 billion U.S. dollars ) into their books by the end of this fiscal year .
These stocks were to be sold later when market conditions improved .
It was decided that any gains made by the institutions through offloading the stocks later would be shared on a 50 : 50 basis with the government .
At that time , however , it was not clear how the risk would be shared if the shares were offloaded below the acquisition prices .
The PSUs ' stocks will be placed with institutions at a 20-percent discount .
The financial institutions will be provided the warehousing facility for a period of 18 months .
Financial institutions have expressed displeasure over the government 's pressure for picking up shares of PSUs as a move towards disinvestment .
