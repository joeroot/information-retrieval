Ukrainian Parliament Adopts Crimea 's Constitution
KIEV , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The Ukrainian parliament Wednesday approved the Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea , the first one since Ukraine became independent from the former Soviet Union seven years ago .
Under the constitution , Crimea will be a part of Ukraine , with the Supreme Soviet being its highest political organ and the Council of Ministers its supreme executive organ .
Crimea will have the right to draw up , ratify and implement its budgets , while its autonomous status will ensure its independence in the fields of justice , organization , finance , property and natural resources .
The constitution allows Crimea to have its own national emblem , flag and anthem .
In addition to the Ukrainian language , the constitution will guarantee the use and development of Russian , Crimean Tartar and the languages of ethnic groups .
However , the constitution makes it clear that the laws and decrees passed by Crimea 's Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers will be invalid if they contravene the Constitution and laws of Ukraine .
With an area of 2.61 square kilometers and a population of 2.15 million , Crimea is the sole autonomous republic in Ukraine .
From 1992 to 1995 , Crimea 's parliament submitted four draft constitutions to the Ukrainian parliament for approval , but they were either voted down or only ratified partly .
