1998 to Be Record Tourism Year for Cyprus
NICOSIA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- With only a few days left this year , about 2.23 million tourists are forecast to have visited Cyprus , hitting a record high , local newspapers reported Wednesday .
A report by Cyprus Finance Ministry 's Department of Statistics and Research was quoted by the papers as saying that the number of tourists to Cyprus in the first 11 months of this year rose by 6.8 percent to 2.13 million , compared with the same period last year .
The report attributed the tourist boom to the strong sterling and the sustained love by British tourists for Cyprus , where they can enjoy right-hand side driving , bilingual services and English-style pubs and eateries .
The British arrivals rose by 20.6 percent in the January-November period this year as against the same period last year .
The report also shows that 81.1 percent of the tourists were from western European states .
Britain took the lead with 47.3 percent , followed by Germany , Russia , Greece and Switzerland .
The performance of Cyprus ' tourism sector in 1998 is particularly impressive given the 10.7 percent fall in the arrivals of tourists from east European states resulting from the Russia 's economic meltdown .
Tourism earnings account for nearly 20 percent of Cyprus ' gross domestic product and is the biggest employer of the country .
Preliminary figures from Britain indicate that there will be an increase of about 25 percent in bookings next year , but exact number will be expected early next year .
