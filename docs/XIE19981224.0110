Kenya Ports Authority to Renegotiate Delay
NAIROBI , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Kenya Ports Authority ( KPA ) and shipping lines in the Far East trade are set for major negotiations mid-next month over the Vessel Delay Surcharge ( VDS ) at the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa .
The round table negotiations will be held in Mombasa under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Standing Committee on Shipping ( ISCOS ) , which is an inter-state advisory body on shipping business in Kenya , Tanzania , Zambia and Uganda .
KPA faces an uphill task during the forum to contest the decision of the lines to extend the VDS at the port of Mombasa , the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday .
The VDS is annually passed on by KPA to port users who have continued to raise protests since the VDS was imposed about a year ago .
The lines want to continue to recover costs of being delayed at the berths by KPA .
A senior shipping source was quoted as saying that KPA faces the complaint of having failed to achieve the minimum 200 moves per 24 hours recommended internationally .
However , " KPA is aware of the international regulations which allow shipping lines to impose VDS if it can not achieve the minimum time to work on ships at berth , " the source said .
KPA is also being pushed to seriously address the purchase of modern and appropriate equipment especially at the container terminal to reduce delay for the lines to lift the controversial VDS .
Recently , KPA launched an equipment modernization program and purchased four front loaders worth 164 million Shillings ( 2.73 million U.S. Dollars ) and pledged to buy more facilities , according to the press report .
