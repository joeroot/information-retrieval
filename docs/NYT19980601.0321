ADULT DIAPERS NOT ONLY OPTION
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By JUDY FOREMAN c.1998 The Boston Globe
Over the years , Kathy Duffy , a 38-year-old school teacher , tried many treatments for her severe incontinence _ pills , injections , exercises , even `` retraining '' her bladder .
Everything helped some .
Even so , she was always ducking out on her second graders to rush to the bathroom .
She didn n't sleep much , either .
The urge to urinate woke her every hour or so .
Two weeks ago , Duffy and two other women became the first patients in New England to have a new electrical device called InterStim implanted near their spines to calm bladder spasms .
For the first time in years , Duffy says , she 's sleeping five hours at a stretch , thanks to the device , which seems to slow the excessive firing of nerves to the bladder .
Urinary incontinence strikes 15 million Americans , most of them women and most , like Duffy , well under 65 .
Unlike Duffy , of Reading , Mass. , many of those whose bladders betray them suffer in shameful silence , avoiding other people lest they have an `` accident . ''
Luckily , researchers and venture capitalists are not so shy .
In fact , convinced of the demand for something better than adult diapers , they 're racing to develop pills , plugs , and other devices to keep bladders from their dismal dripping .
Incontinence comes in two main forms _ urge problems like Duffy 's , in which bladder muscles go into spasm , making it impossible to stop urine flow once it starts ; and stress problems , in which weak sphincter or pelvic muscles fail to keep the bladder neck closed during sudden physical stresses like coughing , sneezing , laughing , or exercising .
It can also occur when an obstruction _ usually an enlarged prostate in men _ blocks urine flow , leading to overflow or urge problems .
`` For every kind of incontinence , there 's a pill , or behavioral intervention , a device or an operation , '' says Dr. Neil Resnick , an incontinence specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
`` Cure is usually possible , and usually without surgery . ''
The trick is to diagnose what kind of incontinence you have _ you can have more than one _ and be savvy about your options .
In the past , for instance , incontinent women were often told to have a hysterectomy .
But you don n't need that , says Dr. Deborah Lightner , a Mayo Clinic urologist , unless your uterus has prolapsed and is pressing on the bladder .
In fact , for most people the best bet is to start with the simplest , least invasive options .
For stress incontinence , this means Kegel exercises , in which you strengthen pelvic floor muscles , which can be damaged by giving birth .
To identify these muscles , try stopping urine flow in midstream .
If you can , you 've got the right muscles .
Once you 've found them , make that same exertion 100 times a day , but not during voiding lest you retain urine .
If you can n't pinpoint those muscles on your own , go to a continence center ( many hospitals have them ) and ask for biofeedback training , a system of electrical sensors on patches on the skin or in the vagina or rectum that send an unmistakeable signal when you contract the right muscles .
If your problem is urge incontinence , bladder retraining can help .
You try to stick to a pre-set bathroom schedule , urinating regularly before the bladder gets too full , and learning to suppress temporarily the urge to urinate .
If these simple behavioral tricks don n't help , there 's a slew of devices to control leaky bladders , most of them available by prescription .
Some women , for instance , use vaginal cones , tampon-like devices held in the vagina for 15 minutes twice a day to strengthen pelvic muscles .
Others use pessaries , like Introl , that are inserted into the vagina to support the bladder neck , though these have to be carefully fitted and changed regularly .
Other women prefer a product like Capsure that plugs the opening of the urethra ; it stays in place by suction and is pulled out by a nipple during urination .
New devices like Inflow , which is not yet approved , may be left in the urethra for as long as a month .
Soon , women may also have another option _ a foam patch called Impress that 's designed to stick to the urethral opening like a tiny BandAid .
Impress has been approved but has not yet been marketed for over-the-counter use .
If none of these options works , you can try collagen injections _ done via a needle passed through the urethra .
The collagen squeezes the side of the urethra together , slowing urine flow .
For sheer convenience , many women opt for medications rather than devices .
Estrogen , for instance , can make the urethra more pliable and easier to seal and it can be taken in a variety of ways _ pills , patches , vaginal cream or a vaginal ring that releases the hormone slowly .
For urge incontinence specifically , other drugs also help _ including old standbys like Ditropan and newer ones like Levbid and Detrol , says Dr. David Staskin , director of the continence center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston .
These drugs all block acetylcholine , a chemical secreted by nerves that tells muscles to contract .
The newer verions of this medication cause fewer side effects such as dry mouth and constipation .
Tofranil , an anti-depressant that has the useful side effect of relaxing bladder spasms and tightening the sphincter , can also help , says Dr. Stanley Swierzewski , III , co-director of the Lahey Clinic continence center .
For men with incontinence caused by an enlarged prostate , drugs like Minipress , Hytrin , Cardura or Flomax that relax the urethra can be very helpful .
So does shrinking the prostate itself _ with a drug called Proscar , microwave therapy , or surgery .
Surgery is also an option for some women , and for those with stress incontinence two options work well .
In the `` suspension '' procedure _ done through a vaginal or abdominal incision _ surgeons stitch a drooping bladder to ligaments in the pelvis .
In the other , a `` sling '' is made for the bladder with fascia tissue from the patient or a cadaver .
In the past , surgery has not been a useful option for women with urge incontinence .
But surgery to implant the InterStim `` pacemaker '' like Duffy should become a growing option .
The theory behind InterStim is that urge incontinence is triggered by overactive nerves called C-fibers that run from the spinal cord to the bladder .
The C-fibers are believed to govern urination in babies , whose bladders empty uncontrollably .
These fibers are thought to be quiescent in adults , though they can be reactivated , sometimes after back surgery or pelvic trauma .
Applying an electric current to the bladder nerves seems to shut down the C-fibers but not normal fibers , says Swierzewski , who implanted the device in Duffy and two other patients .
Other researchers are cautious .
InterStim has been tried in fewer than 200 patients at about half a dozen centers , says Resnick .
`` The results are promising , but the number of people who 've had the device implanted is still small . ''
But Duffy needs no convincing : `` I 'm very pleased . ''
