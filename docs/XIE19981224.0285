Informatio ~ ister Julius Spencer said in a radio broadcast Wednesday that the shelling was a preemptive measure by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG , said reports reaching here from Freetown , capital of Sierra Leone .
" Everything is under control and there is no danger to the capital , " Spencer said .
The gunfire began around 4 : 30 a.m. and was interrupted by an interval of around 30 minutes , before falling silent at daybreak , said the reports .
Meanwhile , an ECOMOG officer said Wednesday that more than 1,000 Nigerian troops arrived in Freetown Tuesday as a reinforcement to the sub-regional peacekeeping force there .
Witnesses said more troops from Nigeria landed at dawn Wednesday at Freetown 's Lungi International Airport .
ECOMOG forces have tightened the security on the main approach road into the city from the east , checking frightened residents of outlying areas who were trying to seek shelter in the capital .
Most of the shops and businesses in Freetown were reportedly closed Wednesday .
Chased out of Freetown by ECOMOG last February , rebels of the deposed military junta of Major Paul Johnny Koromah have resorted to guerrilla warfare in the north and east parts of the country .
They have also joined the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front , who have been against successive Sierra Leonean governments since early 1990s .
In recent weeks , the rebels have pushed their activities to areas within a radius of 60 kilometers to the capital .
Reports quoted the rebels as saying that their latest offensive is aimed at forcing the government to the negotiating table , but the government said it would only talk to the rebels after they lay down their arms .
