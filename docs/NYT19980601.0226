PARIS _ With less than two weeks to go before the soccer World Cup kicks off in Paris on June 10 , France has got the jitters .
The month-long series of 64 games , featuring 32 teams from around the world , is expected to be watched , at least once , by a billion or so viewers .
What a wonderful chance for a publicity seeker .
Terrorists , soccer hooligans and striking transport workers are all threatening to spoil the fun _ and sully the proud host 's image around the world .
On May 26 , nearly 100 people suspected of links with Algerian Muslim extremists were arrested in dawn raids in five European countries ( Germany , Belgium , Italy , Switzerland and France ) at the request of France 's leading anti-terrorist magistrate , Jean-Louis Bruguiere .
No explosives and only one firearm were found , but the interior ministry said that months of surveillance had led it to believe that `` terrorist activities were being prepared in the World Cup 's run-up . ''
Three of the 53 nabbed in France live barely a grenade 's throw from a sparkling new 80,000-seat stadium in Paris 's northern suburbs , where nine matches , including the final , are to be played .
Two weeks earlier , an unexploded bomb had been found in front of France Telecom 's offices in Paris 's northeast .
No one has claimed responsibility , but the bomb was like the ones used in a wave of attacks in France inspired by Algerian extremists in 1995 , when ten people were killed and more than 150 injured .
Dozens of suspected Algerian terrorist sympathizers are already in French jails after earlier clampdowns on Muslim extremists .
Some 130 , arrested three years ago , are to go on trial this September .
Other potential troublemakers include Basque and Corsican separatists , never averse to a bomb or two .
And then , of course , there are football hooligans , notably from England .
The British government has tried to do its bit to prevent exporting England 's national shame , with the slogan `` No ticket , don n't travel . ''
But a junior French minister , on a visit to London to boost French tourism not long ago , flummoxed everyone by inviting `` as many Britons as possible '' to come and join in festivities , ticket or no ticket .
Quelle gaffe !
Actually , the way things are going , the hooligans _ as well as better-behaved fans _ may find it hard to get to France .
The main pilots ' union has called a 15-day strike from June 1 to protest against plans to dock their pay by 15 percent in exchange for a shareholding in Air France when the state-owned airline is privatized .
And two French train-drivers ' unions have called for a 24-hour ( repeatable ) stoppage on June 10 , the day of the World Cup kick-off .
Truck drivers also threatened protests during the Cup , but have put off further action until the autumn .
The government is drawing some comfort from a belief that most unions will be reluctant to risk the unpopularity of any disruption to the Cup .
Another aggrieved group may , however , make itself felt : French women .
While men are expected to be glued to their television sets , three-quarters of women say they will switch right off , and a tenth are positively dreading the entire event .
So `` special activities '' are being set up for France 's jaundiced , abandoned wives .
The Chippendales , a male striptease quintet , are putting on a show in Paris from June 15 entitled `` Les filles sans foot , '' which means `` Girls without football '' but also sounds like `` Les filles s ' en foutent '' _ `` Girls don n't give a damn '' ( or something rather ruder ) .
Another bunch of male strippers , the California Dream Men , will be undressing at the Folies Bergeres in a `` Widows of the World Cup '' spectacular .
Some restaurants are offering four meals for the price of three to all-female groups .
And Cup-bashing outfits , with such names as La Coupe est pleine ( My Cup runneth over ) is arranging `` hen outings . ''
Sociologists are even predicting _ in all earnest _ a steep rise in divorce .
At the same time , some 20 extra tons of World Cup condoms have , it is said , been imported .
