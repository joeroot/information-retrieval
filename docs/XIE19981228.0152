Commission Urges Improved Project Quality
BEIJING , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- The State Development Planning Commission ( SDPC ) issued a Sunday circular urging Yunnan Province to conduct a thorough investigation and punish those responsible for poor quality projects .
In addition , the Ministry of Communications has urged all provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities to inspect the quality of infrastructure projects and adopt measures to remove hidden dangers , according to the circular .
The SDPC plans to dispatch quality inspection teams in mid-January 1999 to inspect key state projects .
Projects failing to operate in accordance with operational procedures or which otherwise fail to fulfill quality standards will be subject to the lose of state funding .
The circular cited two projects in Yunnan and one in Liaoning Province as striking examples of violations of state bid procedures .
The Kunming City Bureau of Communications built the 72-km Kunming-Luquan Highway in Yunnan Province at a cost of 377 million yuan .
However , the highway was filled with potholes and cracks only 18 days after opening to traffic in May .
An ensuing investigation revealed that contracts used substandard cement and an inferior mixture of stone and sand on the project .
The low quality work cost the state an additional 100 million yuan in reconstruction funds .
The Qingyanghe Bridge on the Shenyang-Siping Expressway in northeast China 's Liaoning Province was cited as another example of low quality construction .
Fatal traffic accidents occurred on the bridge due to collapsed sections resulting from the use of inferior cement and insufficient reinforcement beams .
A commentary in today 's " People 's Daily " called on all localities and departments to draw lessons from the poor quality projects , adopt strict requirements for project quality , improve engineering supervision systems and render punishment to parties engaging in fraudulent acts .
