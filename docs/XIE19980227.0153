Australian Exporters Urged to Help Asian Customers
CANBERRA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Australian exporters should be prepared to bear some financial pain to help their Asian customers weather their financial problems , Primary Industries and Energy Minister John Anderson said Friday in Hobart , a southeast port city in the country .
Anderson was speaking at a news conference after federal and state agriculture ministers held wide-ranging discussions on the Asian financial crisis , the Australian Associated Press reported .
The ministers decided to formally acknowledge the importance for Australian federal and state governments and industry to maintain " quality relationships " with their troubled Asian neighbors .
Anderson said the federal government had made a significant contribution , especially through participating in three International Monetary Fund economic aid packages .
Individual companies should help by talking to their customers , trying to meet their needs and " sometimes wearing some financial pain in terms of lower prices in recognition that there will be a recovery . "
" If you work with your customers through difficult times you can stay together and prosper together in the longer term . "
Anderson also said it was too early to assess fully the effect of the crisis on Australian farmers , but Indonesia 's problems would have a " real impact " on the live cattle trade .
The wool industry had already suffered significant price reductions because of slackening activity in countries like South Korea and horticulture had been hit hard .
