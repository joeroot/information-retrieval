Netanyahu Criticizes Arafat 's Remark on State
JERUSALEM , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said here Monday that Israel rejects Arafat 's speech about the declaration of an independent Palestinian state next year .
" Such a statement run counter to the agreements reached between the two sides and will never be accepted by Israel , " he said .
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat told the gathering of Arab-American community in Washington on Sunday that he will declare an independent Palestinian state next May with Jerusalem as its capital .
Netanyahu said that such a move by Arafat could only cause damage to the Mideast peace process .
" Jerusalem is part of Israel and Jerusalem is the capital of Israel , " Netanyahu said .
Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will not allow the establishment of a Palestinian state in the territory and the Palestinians could only have an entity running daily business , but without military forces or other powers a state has .
Under the Oslo accords , the five-year transitional period expires next May and Arafat has the right to declare an independent state by then .
But the Palestinian leader recently declared that any pending disputes should be settled peacefully through negotiations .
