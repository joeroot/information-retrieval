EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON 'S RESPONSE TO A MOTION BY STARR
( See CLINTON-STARR ) ( ja ) c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from papers filed Monday in the U.S. Supreme Court by President Clinton in response to a motion on Thursday by the independent counsel for an expedited review of claims made by Clinton that would block the testimony of some of his top aides : & QL ;
STATEMENT OF THE CASE :
On May 4 , 1998 , the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ( Johnson , C.J . ) , granted the relief sought in motions filed by the O.I.C .
[ Office of the Independent Counsel ) seeking to compel Bruce Lindsey , deputy counsel to the President , and Sidney Blumenthal , assistant to the President , to testify concerning discussions they had had with the President of the United States and with Presidential advisers .
The President had asserted that certain of the communications at issue were covered by the Presidential communications privilege , the Governmental attorney-client privilege , and the attorney work product doctrine .
...
In its motions to compel , the O.I.C .
raised two legal arguments .
First , it contended that , because the communications over which the President had asserted the Presidential communications privilege related to private conduct , the privilege did not apply at all .
Relying on this court 's opinion in United States v. Nixon , the District Court rejected that argument .
Indeed , the District Court found as a fact that the communications that the grand jury was seeking were related to official decision-making .
At this stage , the court has no evidence that Lindsey and Blumenthal 's conversations discussing the Lewinsky and Jones matters were not related in some way to official decision-making .
To the contrary , the court has [ REDACTED ) sworn affidavits asserting that the conversations at issue involve official matters such as possible impeachment proceedings , domestic and foreign policy matters , and assertions of official privileges .
The Office of the President submitted the affidavits `` to establish as a factual matter that the communications in the White House over which executive privilege was being asserted related to official matters and official conduct . ''
The grand jury transcripts provided to the court do not indicate that the witnesses refused to answer questions regarding conversations that did not relate to the President 's official duties .
...
The O.I.C .
also argued before the District Court that as a matter of law , the President could not assert a Governmental attorney-client privilege in the face of a Federal grand jury subpoena .
The District Court rejected this argument as well .
The court held that the President did enjoy a Governmental attorney-client privilege with members of his counsel 's office , but , as was true of the Presidential communications privilege , it could be overcome on O.I.C . 's showings of need and inability to obtain the information from any other source .
...
Despite the O.I.C . 's claims to the contrary , the fate of the nation will not hang in the balance if the O.I.C .
is required to participate in the court of appeals on an expedited basis before seeking this court 's intervention .
...
With the question presented , with respect to the White House , narrowed to that arising out of the Governmental attorney-client privilege , the benefits that this court normally derives from fuller explication of legal issues by the courts of appeals are particularly pronounced .
In essence , the O.I.C .
is complaining that , in granting its motion , a Federal district judge failed to follow a precedent set by a Federal court of appeals in a different jurisdiction .
But a disagreement between a single district judge and a single court of appeals does not amount to a circuit split that would warrant the granting of certiorari , even in normal circumstances .
...
On the merits , we believe that the O.I.C . 's position , which rests principally on the proposition that 28 U.S.C .
535 ( b ) overrides the attorney-client privilege , is misguided .
As a matter of policy , the White House follows the dictates of section 535 ( b ) , reporting to the Attorney General any information it receives of violations of Title 18 by executive branch officials .
We note , however , that the statute , by its terms , does not apply to the Office of the President .
By contrast , it is apparent that the O.I.C . 's investigation here is a precursor to a possible referral to the House of Representatives .
Such a proceeding would be against the President in his official capacity , represented in that matter by the Counsel to the President .
Moreover , some of the questions the O.I.C .
has posed to Mr. Lindsey relate to advice to the President about the assertions of privilege in this very litigation .
In this setting , where the White House is undeniably an adversary of the O.I.C . , the President is entitled to an absolute attorney-client privilege for his discussions with White House counsel , just like any other party to a legal proceeding .
For all these reasons , allowing the court of appeals in this case to assess the rationale of the Eighth Circuit 's decision and determine whether it ought to govern in the District of Columbia will allow this court to benefit from the court of appeals ' informed deliberation .
The petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment in the court of appeals should be denied .
