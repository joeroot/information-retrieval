Roundup : China Spearheading APEC Sci-Tech Cooperation
KUALA LUMPUR , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- China has dedicated 10 million U.S. dollars to establish a fund to finance cooperation in science and technology with other Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) countries .
The establishment of the China APEC Science and Technology Industry Cooperation fund was announced by Chinese President Jiang Zemin here Wednesday morning and won widespread praise from other APEC members here .
The fund , which will be provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology ( MST ) , the Ministry of Finance and the State Economic and Trade Commission , will help implement the APEC Agenda for Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st century ,
Observers pointed out that as the biggest developing country in the world , China was playing a more and more important role .
It was widely acknowledged that the measures China has adopted in the financial crisis were important to stablize the regional and international economies , and the establishment of the fund set a good example for other member countries .
China has long advocated cooperation in the science and technology industry , an important aspect of economic cooperation , within the framework of APEC .
The promotion of science and technology and education is now internationally recognized as vital to the development of national economies .
Meanwhile , the promotion of science and technology cooperation may bring pragmatic benefits for all parties concerned without necessarily being affected by political factors .
In a proposal by China , cooperation in science and technology was first put on the agenda of APEC in 1993 , and a special working group was established a year later .
Since then , economic and technological cooperation , one of the two pillars of APEC , have been developing .
The other pillar is normally believed to be trade and investment liberalization .
Proposed by Jiang , the first meeting of APEC ministers of science and technology was held in Beijing in October 1995 .
Jiang opened the meeting , which was attended by more than 200 delegates .
So far , cooperation in science and technology industry has led to the the implementation of 65 programs , five of which were put forward by China and eight of which involved China .
At the fifth APEC Leaders Informal Meeting in Vancouver in 1997 , Jiang proposed to formulate the Agenda of APEC Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st century .
His proposal was widely accepted and later written into the leaders ' declaration .
Through concerted effort by relevant departments of China and APEC organizations , the agenda was formulated and agreed upon at the third meeting of the ministers of science and technology in Mexico in October this year , and was eventually adopted by the current leaders meeting .
On Tuesday , at talks with representatives from the APEC Business Advisory Council , Jiang reiterated the stand of the Chinese government on strengthening economic and technological cooperation .
He hoped that the Kuala Lumpur meeting could be an important milestone in this field .
An MST official noted that the Chinese government had been pushing the cooperation of science and technology industry among APEC members for a long time , and the establishment of the fund was simply another good example of China 's sincerity .
He hoped that other member countries could also make due contributions to promote this cause .
