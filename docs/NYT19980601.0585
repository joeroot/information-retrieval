MLICKI LOOKS BAD IN METS ' LOSS
( ja ) By JASON DIAMOS c.1998 N.Y .

PITTSBURGH _ Hideo Nomo is looking for work .
Brian Bohanon would rather start than relieve .
And Bill Pulsipher is chafing at Norfolk over the possibility of pitching in the major leagues again .
All of which means Dave Mlicki should be looking over his shoulder about now .
On one of the strongest staffs in the majors , Mlicki has been the weak link .
Monday night , another poor outing by the 29-year-old right-hander helped break the Mets ' string of nine straight victories .
Mlicki ( 1 - 4 ) allowed four runs , three of them earned , in six innings in a 4 - 3 loss to Jason Schmidt ( 8 - 1 ) and the Pittsburgh Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium .
The hole Mlicki dug for them led to the end of the Mets ' longest winning streak in nearly seven years and was just too deep for them to overcome , even though they rallied for three runs in the last two innings .
In losing for only the second time in 13 games , about the only things that went right for the Mets were Mike Piazza 's first home run with the team , which spoiled Schmidt 's bid for a shutout with two out in the eighth , and three more hits from Carlos Baerga , who is now batting . 306 .
Mlicki , whose earned run average over 10 starts is 5.68 , did not have it from the start .
By his third pitch , the Mets trailed by 1 - 0 on a home run by Tony Womack , the Pirates ' leadoff batter .
After Mlicki walked the No. 7 and No. 8 hitters in the Pittsburgh order to open the second inning , both scored , and the Mets were down by three runs after two innings .
It was a deficit that even these new and improved Mets could not overcome .
In the past , the Mets ' pitching and defense had often been able to compensate for a lack of hitting .
And during the last 10 days , the hitting _ bolstered immeasurably by the addition of Piazza , who has hit safely in each of his eight games with the Mets _ had been able to offset lapses in pitching .
But Monday night , no pitching , no defense ( three errors , tying a season high ) and very little hitting ( just six hits off Schmidt after the Mets had 100 in the previous seven days ) translated into only one thing : the Mets ' first defeat in 10 games , and their first in eight with Piazza behind the plate .
That it came with Mlicki on the mound could only lead to questions about how long he would remain in the rotation .
`` He 's really tough on himself , to the point of being a little ridiculous sometimes , '' Manager Bobby Valentine said before the game .
`` I don n't see him as being so unique in his worries , his efforts and his results as a lot of people do .
The difference is he 's had pretty good stuff , and he 's had it work in his favor . ''
Not lately , however .
Over his last three starts , Mlicki has allowed 13 earned runs in 151 / 3 innings , with an ERA 7.63 .
When do the guarantees end , Valentine was asked before the game .
`` When the time is right for them to end , '' the manager said .
`` He started last year , and I remember all the same questions .
It was very similar to Carlos Baerga 's situation .
He was the pitching Carlos .
`` Right now , I feel he 's the best starting on my staff .
Because some people don n't understand that , I sometimes say , ` Too bad . '' '
But Valentine also said : `` I don n't like to make promises or assure anybody anything .
Remember , this is the big leagues .
One guy has the opportunity .
And three or four guys are waiting for it . ''
Those guys could include Nomo , who is a close friend of the Mets ' Masato Yoshii and who thrived with Piazza as his catcher in Los Angeles .
Even if the Mets pass on Nomo , Bohanon and Pulsipher are waiting in the wings .
But Valentine feels he has Bohanon slotted in just the right spot as a long reliever / spot starter .
And the Mets may feel Pulsipher is not yet ready for the prime time again .
So Mlicki might remain in the rotation by default .
For how long might be the better question .
