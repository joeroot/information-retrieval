U.S. , Japan to Conduct Joint Research on Missile System
NEW YORK , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States and Japan on Sunday agreed to conduct joint research on a missile defense system .
This was announced at a joint press conference held in New York by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , Defense Secretary William Cohen , their Japanese counterparts Masahiko Komura and Fukushiro Nukaga .
" No one should doubt our commitment to defend our interests and to work together for peace and stability in Asia , " said Cohen , adding that the joint research " is the best way to protect both the United States and Japan . "
Japan and the United States " will spare no efforts " to improve defense and security in the region , said Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura .
The United States and Japan announced security alliance guidelines last year .
In a joint U.S . - Japan statement on Sunday , the two governments renewed their commitments to the 1994 agreed framework with the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) to freeze the latter 's nuclear program in exchange for the construction of light-water reactors to meet its energy needs .
Komura said Japan , a party to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization agreement , still supports the program , but at the moment it " can not go ahead with the smooth contribution of 1 billion U.S. dollars " due to the DPRK 's " recent missile test " .
The whole scheme costs about 4.6 billion dollars with the United States and South Korea as two other major contributors .
In their statement , the United States and Japan also urged the DPRK not to develop , test , launch or deploy missiles .
The two sides also talked about economic matters .
Albright said Japan took an important step in approving a plan to reform its debt-ridden banks .
" What will be important is how it is implemented , " she added .
There are other aspects of an economic program that we would like to see and President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will be discussing that during their summit , Albright said .
The summit is scheduled for Tarrytown , New York on Tuesday , a day after the general debate of the 53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly starts .
Clinton arrived in New York on Sunday and will address the Assembly on Monday .
