Denmark to Hold Plebiscite in 2001 on If Joining EMU
STOCKHOLM , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Denmark will hold a nationwide plebiscite in 2001 on whether to join the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , according to press reports here Saturday .
In the first ever revealment of the government 's intentions over the matter , Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen said Friday that the government is going to publicize the matter late this month and parliament will begin to debate the issue before the end of the year .
The EMU will enter operation in early 1999 when the euro is introduced into some European Union ( EU ) members .
The time would be ripe for the Danish to consider whether to join the EMU after seeing the progress in other countries , Rasmussen noted .
Expressing the belief that the EMU will help stabilize the Danish economy and currency , Rasmussen said he hoped the public would say " yes " to Denmark 's participation .
" I see this as one of the most important diplomatic missions in my term as prime minister , " he said .
Denmark has conducted five polls in the past few years on its relations with the EU because the Danish have had different views on the development of the European Community and the EU .
Denmark joined the European Community in 1973 .
More and more Danish people are showing positive attitudes towards their country 's participation into the EMU , according to media reports .
