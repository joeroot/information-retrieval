New Zealand-Germany Air Services Increase
WELLINGTON , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- New Zealand Monday welcomes Germany 's agreement to remove a quota restricting Air New Zealand 's carriage of Germany-U.S .
and Germany-Australia passengers on its services to and from Frankfurt , to the benefit of Lufthansa 's services on those routes .
The quota was introduced in 1993 as a condition for allowing Air New Zealand to operate a third weekly service to Frankfurt .
" The quota was an irritant in our aviation relationship with Germany , and we are pleased to see it gone , " New Zealand Minister of Transport Maurice Williamson said Monday in a statement .
The minister added that following success in recent air services negotiations between New Zealand and Germany , flight frequencies for the airlines of each side , when using their own aircraft , increase from three services per week to five services per week with immediate effect .
" A further increase to seven services per week will be effective from October next year , " he said , adding that there are now no restrictions on the number of code-share flights that can be provided , nor on the number of cargo-only services that can be operated .
" Access for New Zealand airlines to more destinations in Germany was also agreed , " Williamson said .
" Three destinations in Germany are now available for own-aircraft services , with all other destination points available through code-shared services , " he said .
" Previously , only one destination point was available for own-aircraft services , " he explained .
In the statement , Williamson said Air New Zealand is looking to join early next year the Star Alliance , an airline grouping with Lufthansa being a founder member .
