MOTHER , SPRINTER , WINNER : NAIA STANDOUT A STUDY IN EFFORT
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By ANDY FRIEDLANDER c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Like most single mothers , Kathy Nelson 's life is a race .
Rushing to take the children to school and soccer practice .
Zipping off to do the shopping .
You know , the usual .
Dashing 400 meters at the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics national track championships last weekend in Tulsa , Okla.
`` What she 's accomplished has been incredible , '' said Randy Heath , Nelson 's track coach at Oklahoma Christian University .
`` I was skeptical about her at first because I didn n't know anything about her .
But once I saw her , I knew .
You could tell right away she was going to be special . ''
Nelson has proved that in three years at Oklahoma Christian , an NAIA school in Oklahoma City .
The Grand Prairie native and former Nolan High School star qualified for the NAIA championship meet at 100 , 200 and 400 meters and has school records in all three events .
She has earned NAIA All-America recognition three times in indoor competition , including her national runner-up finish in the 400 last weekend .
In addition , Nelson , a biology major with a 3.91 grade-point average , was an NAIA scholar-athlete and won the prestigious A.O .
Duer Award , presented to an NAIA junior student-athlete in who excels in academics and athletics .
She was OCU 's outstanding science student in 1997 .
And one more thing .
Nelson , who will turn 30 on June 8 , is 10 years older than many of her teammates and track rivals .
She 's the single mother of three children _ 11-year-old David , 10-year-old Daniel and 8-year-old Patrick .
`` It gets real tough at times , '' Nelson said .
`` The hardest part is finding time to study .
I squeeze in study time whenever I can .
I 'll study in the car during soccer practice and at halftime of their games .
There are a lot of late nights after they 've gone to bed . ''
Not to mention a lot of long days , including classes , workouts and track meets .
Nelson gets help with the children from her ex-husband , Roy Nelson , who moved to the Oklahoma City area and is a large part of his sons ' lives .
`` They see their dad a lot , and him being here really helps me , '' Kathy Nelson said .
`` That lets me do what I have to do .
...
I just look at it like it 's a job .
I need this to get where I want to go . ''
Where she wants to go is a career as a physical therapist , something she has dreamed of since she was a newly divorced mother teaching physical education at Preschool Enrichment in North Richland Hills .
Nelson 's dream came closer to reality this month when she was accepted into the University of Oklahoma 's highly regarded physical therapy program for her senior year .
But that means that she must leave OCU and give up track _ according to NCAA rules , she will be too old to run for the Sooners _ but such an opportunity is why she decided to go to college in 1995 .
`` I 'm very excited about it , but I do have mixed feelings , '' she said .
`` I 'll miss running , and I 'll miss Oklahoma Christian .
But I can n't turn this offer down . ''
Three years ago , such a chance seemed impossible .
Nelson knew she wanted to attend college , but between work and her children , all she could manage was a few scattered classes at Tarrant County Junior College .
That changed thanks to her boss , Preschool Enrichment owner Gary Hill , an OCU graduate and a strength coach for Fort Worth Christian 's athletic program .
In that capacity , he had seen young Kathy Patton star for Nolan in volleyball , basketball and track .
He watched her soar to the 1985 state private school long jump championship with a leap of 18 feet , one-half inch , still the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools all-class record .
`` I knew she was a very good athlete , '' Hill said .
`` She had always wondered if she could compete at that level .
I knew she had the talent to do it when she was younger , and I knew she had the drive at the time .
And she had made it through some very difficult times with a smile on her face .
I didn n't know she was going to compete on such a high national level , but I was sure she 'd be competitive . ''
Hill worked with Nelson on a weight-training program and track workouts to get her into running shape .
When he felt she was ready , he called his friend Heath and told him to take a look at the prospect he had discovered .
Heath was dubious , but gave her a small athletic scholarship in addition to her academic scholarship .
Hill promised to pick up the rest of her expenses as long as she stayed in school .
Nelson was an instant success on the track .
By her sophomore year , she was an indoor All-America at 200 and 400 meters .
Her regret is that she never made All-America outdoors .
This year , Nelson ranked in the top five nationally in the 100 and 200 and eighth in the 400 , but a strained Achilles ' tendon sustained in the invitational 200 at the Drake Relays sidelined her much of the season .
Still at less than full speed at the NAIA meet last week in Tulsa , Nelson wound up seventh in the 400 , one place short of All-America status .
But that 's a minor detail .
After all , what 's important to Nelson has always been the education , mostly because it will mean a better life for her children .
`` I 've met my goals and then some , '' she said .
`` Things just keep falling into place .
Sometimes I feel like I 'm being carried to the right place .
It 's been a blessing . ''
