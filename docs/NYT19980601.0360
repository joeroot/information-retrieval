STOCK MARKET GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW DOWN
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) bY KENNETH HOOKER c.1998 The Boston Globe
Q. My husband and I are in our late 40s and our main financial goal is to retire in 12 years when our $ 85,000 mortgage is paid off .
We earn $ 65,000 combined , and have these savings : $ 70,000 in stock IRAs to which we make the maximum allowed contributions , $ 44,500 in eight taxable mutual fund accounts , mostly dominated by stocks ; $ 62,000 in blue-chip stocks , and $ 50,000 in a company savings plan , with 80 percent of this in Textron stock .
What would you estimate the value of these investments in 12 years if no contributions were made beyond fully funding the IRAs ?
Should I sell some of the individual stocks , perhaps to pay down the mortgage ?
J.J . , Sharon
& UR ; UFanswer & LR ; If we assume 10 percent average annual growthover that time , you would have $ 800 , 287 .
The problem is that while I believe 10 percent is reasonable for long-term stock market growth , I 'm not particularly happy with it for the next 12 years .
I 've long thought it was time for the market to take a rest , and the way things seem to be going that rest might last for some time .
Remember , from the highs of the late 1960s , it took about a decade for the Dow to return to those levels ( although to be fair , the Dow is a narrow measure , and those statistics don n't include dividends ) .
The point is that it would be only prudent to consider average returns of 8 percent over those 12 years , which would mean the combined accounts would reach $ 649 , 039 .
What does all of this mean ?
If you have other retirement assets , such as pensions , these would combine with Social Security to put you in a pretty comfortable situation in retirement , whatever the market does .
If there is no pension , I suggest you keep plugging away _ to the company savings plan and to the taxable fund accounts as well as the IRAs .
I have no major problem with the portfolio , which mainly consists of solid large-cap funds .
And selling off any of the common stock likely won n't cause pain on tax day .
Perhaps you want to adopt a modest alternative plan to selling stock to pay down the mortgage : redirecting all dividends from the stock accounts to mortgage repayments .
If you do that , however , it will reduce those growth projections , which presume reinvestment of all returns .
You should probably continue to reinvest these dividends , not in more of the common stock but in a balanced fund account such as the Vanguard Wellington position you already hold , treating this as the first step in a long series of moves designed to make the portfolio more conservative and more yield-oriented .

Q. Four years ago I opened a Uniform Gifts to Minors account for my new great-grandson .
Based on a recommendation from one of your columns , I chose Vanguard Index Value fund .
It has done well , as you know .
I now have a new great-granddaughter and wish to open a similar account for her .
Do you still recommend this fund ?
P.F . , Chula Vista , Calif.
& UR ; UFanswer & LR ; Yes , and I think the numbers back me up .
Vanguard Index Value was launched Nov. 2 , 1992 , and from that time through April 30 it has averaged 21.98 percent annual total returns .
On the same day a sibling fund , Vanguard Index Growth , was also launched , and its comparable record is 21.72 percent average annual total returns .
The two funds have complementary portfolios , with Index Value holding the two-thirds of the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's stock with the lowest price-to-book ratios , and Index Growth holding the remaining issues .
My distrust of the current market , of course , makes me favor Index Value particularly .
My assumption is that when stocks come under pressure , those with the higher yields and the lower price-to-earnings ratios will be relatively stronger .
The last reports from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows an average portfolio P/E of 21.4 for Index Value , compared with 32.1 for Index Growth .
Yields were 1.5 percent for Index Value and 0.9 percent for Index Growth _ both puny , of course , but a good reason why the more defensive Index Value is the better bet now .
For the record , though , I should point out that Morningstar gives Index Growth five stars , its top grade , while Index Value wins only four , meaning above average ; these ratings are entirely statistical , and the bulk of the difference can probably be found in those five-year comparative results .
