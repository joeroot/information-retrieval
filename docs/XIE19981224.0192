From Poverty to Well-to-do : An Account of A Farmer 's Family ( 2 )
The village , had only a small spring in the mountains to provide water three years ago , but the water-shortage problem changed when a 27,000-yuan water conservancy project started in 1995 .
Villagers now have easy access to tap water , and it provides water for villages nearby .
Looking for jobs in other counties or provinces is another major way of getting out of poverty .
A decade ago , however , 80 percent of the villagers never went outside the county and some older people had never seen a train .
Economic development has aroused villagers ' awareness of the democratic process .
Like many other villages in China , Wenfeng has an open account system and its leaders are chosen by all eligible village voters .
In June , a 16-member village council was elected as a decision-making body .
" In the past , the village cadres had the final say on issues , " says one member of the first village council , " but that is now reversed . "
He says , for example , that the local government recently allocated a certain amount of money for a poverty relief loan and the council decided , after discussing the matter , to provide the loan to the most needy .
And no one complained .
Wenfeng 's per capita income is expected to reach 900 yuan this year , and per capita grain production , 400 kilograms .
The figure is much lower than the national average of 2,090 yuan , but well above the poverty line of 500 yuan .
In China , the county was synonomous with poverty , but , if it can solve the food and clothing problem , there is no doubt that the rest of the country can do it too , some analysts say .
