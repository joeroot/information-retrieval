Thai Commerce Ministry to Monitor Prices
BANGKOK , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry will closely monitor the cost of living and employ every means possible to limit inflation this year , the Bangkok Post reported Friday .
The latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) predicted that Thailand 's inflation rate could reach 11.6 percent this year .
Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted as saying his ministry and its local agencies would cooperate in monitoring the prices of goods offered by retailers .
Local officials would be asked to watch for hoarding and illegal smuggling of goods for export as well as the international reduction of production to create shortages to trigger price rises .
Local commerce officials are to file a report on price movements for 22 controlled goods to the ministry each week .
The authorities will also ensure that retailers of uncontrolled goods display the price of each type of goods and give correct information about the price of each product to prevent profiteering by traders .
