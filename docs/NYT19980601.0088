LOS ANGELES _ This isn n't the time for manager Jack McKeon to pull a Mount St. Helen 's .
Blowing his top isn n't going to right what 's wrong with the Cincinnati Reds .
First of all , what you 're seeing is what you 'll get .
This is not a championship team .
This is not a . 500 team .
Nobody promised a rose garden .
Too many weeds .
What you 're getting is what $ 21 million will buy .
It gets you ten defeats in 13 games .
It gets you 52 errors in 54 games .
It gets you five double play grounders in one game .
And it gets you a 67-year-old manager who knows good card players can n't bluff with a bad hand .
`` We 're not as bad as we 're playing right now , '' he said .
`` And when you are going bad , you can n't browbeat them .
You try to be patient , try to console them , try to pick ' em up .
If I thought they weren n't trying , it would be different .
Hey , you evaluate your assets , see what you got and go on .
You don n't beat ' em down , you try to keep ' em up . ''
Even when you don n't have much .
`` My objective is to make them 10 to 15 percent better as we go along , '' McKeon said .
`` Make ' em a little bit better as you go along . ''
At times , though , it can test a man 's constitution and Thursday night was a difficult exam .
The Reds hit into five double plays , stranded 12 runners and failed to make two defensive plays in the ninth inning that led to a 4 - 3 defeat .
McKeon and some of his coaches were up after the game until 2 a.m. ( 5 a.m. , eastern ) rehashing what has been going on .
It 's very simple .
Good pitching .
Poor defense .
Absolutely zero clutch hitting .
`` We don n't give our pitchers any breathing room , '' he said .
`` If they make one mistake , they get beat and that mistake is magnified . ''
McKeon admits that even though he has a young team , there is some dead kindling hanging around .
`` Sometimes you 'd just like to back up the truck , load ' em up and ship ' em out , '' McKeon said .
`` Sometimes you 'd take a lump of coal or an old shoe for some of them . ''
That 's what he did when he took over the San Diego Padres in 1980 .
The team was flopping around in last place with some fading veterans .
He got rid of first baseman Willie Montanez , third baseman Aurelio Rodriguez , second baseman Dave Cash , outfielder Von Joshua , infielder Fred Kendall , pitcher Bob Shirley _ all guys who had been good major-league players but were doing not much more in San Diego than enjoying an extended vacation .
`` I brought up our young players like Tim Flannery and Luis Salazar and Dave Dravecky , '' McKeon said .
`` The next year we were at . 500 and in 1984 we won the National League pennant . ''
And he had done it before .
Charles O. Finley dismantled the great Oakland teams of the early 1970s and turned over a team of Triple-A players for McKeon to manage in 1977 .
`` We had guys like Scott Winchester and Eddie Priest and Jon Nunnally and Chris Stynes .
.
. that team was very much like this one , '' McKeon said .
`` We made some trades and the young kids began developing .
I got fired in 1978 , but Billy Martin used my players to win the division in 1979 . ''
So McKeon sees the 1998 Cincinnati Reds in much the same light as the 1977 Oakland A 's or the 1980 San Diego Padres .
And that 's why he can n't explode over inefficient play .
`` If they 're not trying , that 's different , '' he said .
`` If they 're dogging it , that 's different .
I get upset if they don n't give me effort .
This team is giving me all the effort it has . ''
McKeon paused for a long puff on his always-present cigar .
`` Of course , there always comes a time when you 've seen enough .
And you blow your top , '' he said .
And games like Thursday 's push the thermometer to the popping limit .
It 's called growing pains , but it sometimes gives McKeon a pain where he sits .
