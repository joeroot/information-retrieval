1 DEFENSE CONTRACTOR IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By MICHAEL PAULSON c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
WASHINGTON _ The Boeing Co. , now the nation 's second largest defense contractor , has vaulted into first place in a defense industry category that really matters in Washington , D.C. : campaign contributions .
Figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show that Boeing has given more than $ 1 million to federal campaigns over the past 17 months , more than any other defense contractor .
The contributions come at a time when a vastly expanded Boeing _ the company now employs 237,500 people _ faces a myriad of concerns in Congress , ranging from defense spending to international trade policy .
Just Monday , Boeing bought three full-page , color ads in Roll Call , a newspaper widely read in D.C. political circles .
One promoted its role as prime contractor of the international space station , another touted the alleged successes of acquisition reform at the Pentagon , and a centerfold pushed the F-22 fighter jet as `` bad news for bullies everywhere . ''
Wednesday Boeing will join the annual battle to promote normal trade relations with China _ a country that remains a huge potential market for commercial aircraft , but that is enmeshed in bitter controversy in Congress .
The annual June debate , always contentious , is complicated this year by controversies over satellite launches , campaign contributions and rising nuclear tension in Asia .
President Clinton will make a strong case for renewing trade ties with China , his spokesman said .
The increasing campaign spending by Boeing brings increasing scrutiny for the Seattle-based company .
Two reports released Monday questioned the company 's motivations for making large campaign contributions .
The report by the Center for Responsive Politics pointed out that Boeing gave $ 30,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $ 25,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on April 30 , the same day that the Senate voted to enlarge NATO to include Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic .
The report argued that the contributions were part of defense industry campaign to win NATO enlargement so the companies could sell more military equipment to those countries .
That contention was rejected by Boeing spokesman Douglas Kennett , who said the company contributed to the two Senate campaign committees at the end of April because that 's when the committees were holding fundraisers .
`` We actively support events held by both parties , and that money was for contribution and attendance at events , '' Kennett said .
`` To try to link that to a specific vote is preposterous . ''
Kennett said the company did `` actively support NATO enlargement , '' but `` for all the right reasons , '' which he said included a peaceful Europe .
Another report , by the Center for Public Integrity , argued that the nation 's aviation interests , including Boeing , have been laxly regulated because they have given more than $ 43.8 million to congressional campaigns since 1987 .
The Center for Public Integrity 's executive director , Charles Lewis , was chosen Monday for a prestigious `` genius grant '' from the MacArthur Foundation .
`` The failure of the aviation industry to fix identified safety problems , with the tacit consent of Congress , is easily the most striking discovery of our investigation , '' Lewis said .
`` People have died or been maimed for life because of this inaction . ''
That contention was rejected by both Boeing and the FAA .
`` It is totally false , '' said FAA spokesman Hank Price .
`` The link they 're making , I don n't see it . ''
Boeing spokesman John Dern said `` the safety of the commercial transport industry is excellent , and the FAA , as the primary regulatory body , has a lot to be proud of in that regard . ''
Boeing officially has been the second largest defense contractor since March , when the Pentagon announced that the company had received $ 9.6 million in prime military contract work for fiscal 1997 .
The company had ranked eighth prior to acquiring McDonnell Douglas .
The largest defense contractor is Lockheed Martin .
The campaign contributions from Boeing , and , prior to the merger , from McDonnell Douglas , have come in several forms .
Since the start of 1997 , the companies have given $ 534,000 directly to political campaigns and $ 349,000 to political parties .
Company employees have given another $ 121,000 to federal candidates .
About 63 percent of Boeing 's federal contributions this campaign cycle have gone to Republicans , who control both houses of Congress .
Overall , defense contractors have given $ 2,448,214 to federal campaigns during the current campaign cycle .
About 64 percent of that money has gone to Republicans .
