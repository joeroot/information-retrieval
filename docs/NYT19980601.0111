With its brassy boardwalk , bar and shopping-mall culture , New Jersey is the ancestral home of the attitudinal T-shirt _ the ones that say things like `` I 'm Not as Think as You Drunk I Am '' in blurry letters .
Little surprise , then , that Gov. Christie Whitman chose to proclaim her state 's border victory over New York last week by gleefully displaying a T-shirt that said , `` Ellis Island , N.J . ''
The governor was celebrating a triumph in a once-obscure dispute between New Jersey and New York over boundaries in the middle of the Hudson River .
In a 6-to-3 vote , the Supreme Court ruled that 24.2 acres of Ellis Island landfill were actually in New Jersey , and not in New York as everyone had assumed since the island was expanded starting in the late 19th century to process the arrival of 12 million immigrants .
The original 3.3 acres _ on which the main hall and immigration museum stand _ remain in New York .
No matter which state map it is on , Ellis Island is a national park , owned by the federal government .
Each year 1.6 million tourists visit it .
Last week , reporters dispatched to the island to get reaction to the border victory found a wall of people who might as well have been wearing those T-shirts that say , `` Whatever . ''
In short , the public seemed to care little about state sovereignty over the revered pile of land ( and landfill ) with the breathtaking views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline _ the place where the ancestors of an estimated 40 percent of today 's Americans first set foot in the New World .
On the other hand , politicians and their amen choruses among the news media seemed to care quite a lot .
Mrs. Whitman , for example , proclaimed herself `` delighted that the Supreme Court has officially recognized New Jersey 's place in history , '' and triumphantly set off for a Republican Party fund-raiser in Ohio , where she asserted that the Ellis Island victory was proof that she still had relevance as a politician .
Never one to remain on the sidelines , Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City scoffed at the idea that New Jersey had any valid claim on the island 's mythology .
Giuliani said he was certain his immigrant grandfather hadn n't told himself , `` I 'm coming to New Jersey '' when he boarded a ship in Genoa .
`` He knew he was coming to the streets of New York , '' Giuliani said .
Richard Finnegan , a professor of politics at Stone Hill College in Easton , Mass. , said , `` It seems to me there was a lot of ` My state can lick your state ' in all this . ''
Finnegan said he was astonished at `` the exaggerated attention to a matter that most people think is pretty minor at best . ''
`` I mean , we aren n't exactly talking the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act here , '' he added .
The Supreme Court case took five years and generated 2,000 documents and 4,000 pages of testimony , prompting Justice David Souter to remark ruefully in his majority opinion on the `` succession of legal fees and expenses arising from interstate boundary disputes . ''
The litigation undoubtedly cost New Jersey taxpayers far more than can ever be recouped from the state 's newly staked claim to a portion of the sales tax revenue generated by island 's gift and snack shops .
Finnegan said he was intrigued by the Ellis Island news bubble because of its similarity to another recent scene in modern political theater .
He was referring to a ploy by Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt . , who earlier this year slipped the following words into a routine bill authorizing federal money for research on the Great Lakes : `` The term Great Lakes includes Lake Champlain . ''
Thus , Lake Champlain , a comparative sliver of water between Vermont and New York , suddenly became the sixth Great Lake _ to the delight of regional politicians , area Chambers of Commerce and the local news media , but to the horror of national geographers and historians .
The law was quickly rewritten to withdraw the distinction , but the brouhaha lifted Leahy 's stock .
In the end , Finnegan said , both the Lake Champlain and Ellis Island furors were prime examples of what he called `` policy as entertainment . ''
`` This Ellis Island commotion really represents the infantilization of politics , '' he added , `` driving it down to the seventh-grade level : ` My state whipped your state . '' '
Some reaction in New Jersey seemed to support that notion .
`` It 's about pride , '' crowed an editorial celebrating the Ellis Island victory in The Star Ledger of Newark , New Jersey 's largest newspaper .
`` This was really about respect , not money , '' said Bret Schundler , the mayor of Jersey City , who nevertheless noted that Ellis Island , N.J . , now falls within his city 's boundaries and is potentially part of Jersey City 's urban empowerment zone .
The subject of commercial development is barely submerged under any discussion of change in landlords on Ellis Island .
New Jersey has not indicated whether it might pressure the National Park Service to allow more development on Ellis Island , N.J .
But preservationists have been fretting for years about the fate of that part of the island , which contains the medical buildings where the sick and contagious were once treated .
In 1992 , preservationists blocked a Park Service plan that would have allowed a developer to demolish the old buildings and build a hotel or conference center .
Now they fear similar proposals .
The idea of Ellis Island as a national park that needs money for historical preservation has been swamped by the hoopla in the past week , said Peg Breen , president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy .
`` All the talk has been bragging rights and sales tax and who gets what _ but we 're missing the history part , '' she said .
`` Ellis Island is the only national park in the country that some people look on as a development site waiting for a hotel and conference center . ''
