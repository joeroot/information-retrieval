YONKERS , N.Y .
_ Between retrieving thrown juice cups and cleaning up crushed cookies , the moms in the mother-toddler program at the Irish Community Center here talk about home .
But unlike generations of homesick Irish women before them , many of them aren n't just talking .
They 're going .
With the Irish economy thriving and now an agreement for peace in the long-bloody North _ resoundingly ratified in a referendum last weekend _ the motherland 's pull on its exiles in America seems more powerful than ever .
Many young Irish adults are breaking with earlier generations of Irish immigrants who settled in the United States for good : The Irish government reports that over the last two years , 13,000 more Irish moved back to Ireland from America than went the other way .
That reversal breaks with previous decades of Irish immigration to the United States , one of the oldest , largest , most sustained and most culturally influential migration flows of American history _ reaching nearly a million in the 1850s after the Irish potato famine , but dwindling lately to just a few thousand a year .
For a few years now , the Irish have been celebrating the surprising return of their countrymen from England and Australia as well as America , a trend that the peace agreement seems sure to accelerate .
Now the Irish in America , who once saw little choice but to come here , are confronted with a happy dilemma : choosing between this land of opportunity and a land more familiar to them that has been newly vested with promise .
To economists , Ireland is now `` the Celtic tiger . ''
Thanks largely to American and other foreign investments in high-tech manufacturing plants for computers , pharmaceuticals and other products , newly created jobs have brought unemployment in Ireland down to 9 percent from nearly 16 percent in 1993 .
Investors , in turn , are bullish largely because next year Ireland ( unlike neighboring Britain ) will adopt the European Union 's unified currency , the euro .
Participation in the euro imposes economic discipline on countries using it and is expected to reduce the cost of doing business within the European Union .
Jerry J. Sexton , a labor-market specialist for the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin , said most of those returning from the States are in their mid-20s to mid-30s , and typically have some education or skills .
Across the Atlantic , his assessment is affirmed in interviews with Irish immigrants .
James Dalton , an Irishman who owns Dublin Construction Inc. in Queens , N.Y . , said he typically employs 20 of his countrymen as carpenters or laborers _ and typically one leaves for home every week .
After spending the day refitting a pub in mahogany , two of his 20-year-old carpenters _ both out of Ireland just two months _ ordered a round of Guinness and confided their dream : saving enough money to start a construction business back home .
In many of the Irish bars that dot New York , similar stories are being told , some that sound much like the fantastic tales that envious dreamers in the Old World once told about America .
Seamus Gillespie , a 44-year-old asbestos remover who was sharing a pint and a cigarette with a co-worker and his fiancee at another bar in Woodside , leaned in to give the news about the Irish economy .
`` They 're not building houses , '' he said .
`` They 're building mansions ! ''
Historians of American immigration say revolving-door migrations like this one are nothing new , despite popular myths about America as the promised land .
But they note that the Irish exodus is unusual in that it seems to involve whole households ( as opposed to men without families ) , making the departure of the Irish more noticeable .
Dr. Kerby Miller , a history professor at the University of Missouri who specializes in Irish immigration , calls the turnabout simply astonishing for a people long motivated by starvation and political and religious repression to forsake their homeland .
In the past , he said , `` Irish immigrants longed to return , at least sentimentally , but they realized it was impractical or impossible . ''
Among the factors motivating the new Irish returnees , Irish immigration counselors say , are frustrations and delays in winning American citizenship , given the United States ' current anti-immigrant political climate .
Lately , though , the peace agreement for the British province of Northern Ireland provides another positive for those already weighing a decision to return .
Arriving at the Irish Community Center in Yonkers to pick up his wife and young son , Andrew Convery , a taxi driver from the Bronx , said the prospects for peace are a big factor in their decision to return .
A Catholic from Northern Ireland , he came here six years ago in search of the American dream , and met his future wife , Kerry , a Catholic from Dublin , when he picked her up as a fare .
Now they are moving back so their 1-year-old , Ciaran , can be raised the way they were .
But without the bombs .
`` Before , there wasn n't much to go back to , '' Convery said .
The Irish exodus raises as yet unanswerable questions about the subtler cultural effects on two countries that have long drawn on the richness of the other .
Lately in the United States , Irish culture , once shunned by the upper crust , has enjoyed a broad revival .
`` Angela 's Ashes , '' Frank McCourt 's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of growing up poor in Limerick ( interestingly enough , after his family returned from America ) , has been on The New York Times Best-Seller List for 89 weeks .
And in recent years , `` Lord of the Dance , '' the choreographed extravaganza created by Michael Flatley , an Irish-American , has made Irish folk-dancing almost hip .
The Irish cultural vibrancy here could be diluted by Ireland 's new drawing power , says Dr. Timothy J. Meagher , the director of the Center for Irish Studies at Catholic University in Washington .
`` Now these people are going back , '' he said .
`` If you lose the immigrant base , it threatens the culture . ''
The flow of Irish from the United States can be expected to increase as the Irish government and business groups rev up the welcome wagon .
Ireland 's Department of Social Welfare , which earlier published `` Thinking of Going to London ? ''
and `` Thinking of Going to the United States ? ''
last year switched gears and put out `` Thinking of Returning to Ireland ? ''
_ a guide to housing , pensions and workers ' rights .
