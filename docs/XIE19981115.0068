Beijing Exporting Chinese Cabbage To Southeast Asia
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The Chinese cabbage , which used to be the staple food of northern Chinese , is becoming more popular on foreign dinning tables .
Beijing 's suburban county of Changping plans to export 9,600 tons of Chinese cabbage , with the first batch of 40 tons going to South Korea and Japan over the weekend .
The end of autumn is when northerners start stocking up on cabbages to face the winter .
These always accompanied white radishes and potato as the most common food in winter , and the mountains of cabbage were a staple feature of Western news coverage of China .
The government even fixed the price of Chinese cabbage to make certain that every family could afford enough of the vegetables to get it through the winter .
But , thanks to a decade of changes across the country , both quality and quantity of vegetables have improved and people can now get plenty of alternative vegetables fresh from greenhouses even in the coldest months of the year .
As a result , the demand for the three vegetables declined in recent years and Beijing took the lid off Chinese cabbage prices last year .
Chinese cabbages weren n't moving quickly in Beijing this year and farmers , worried by dropping prices , turned to overseas markets for a solution .
One company was informed that this ordinary vegetable would do well in Japan , the ROK , Singapore , and Hong Kong , so , more than 1,700 farmers in Changping signed contracts for exported Chinese cabbage and other vegetables .
Early reports are that it is doing well in Yugoslavia where it can bring just over 3 U.S. dollars per kilogram .
The price in Beijing is still less than three cents .
Changping plans to increase its vegetable farms by 50 percent to about 800 hectares next year .
