Most Chinese Villages Enjoy Financial Democracy
FUZHOU , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The farmers of Qianyu Village in east China 's Fujian Province used to spend a lot of their time appealing to higher authorities for suspected financial wrongdoings on the part of their village leaders .
But things have changed since the village adopted a system a few years ago that makes financial management public .
Under the new system , all villagers now enjoy the right to know about the village 's financial affairs .
Thanks to this financial democracy , the Qianyu villagers now experience fewer disputes and greater concord , which has led to faster development for the village .
In 1997 , the village achieved 420 million yuan in gross domestic product and 5,300 yuan in per-capita income , more than double the figures before the adoption of the new system .
Like Qianyu , about 80 percent of the country 's nearly one million villages have introduced new financial management patterns , according to a Ministry of Agriculture official .
These moves are part of a national effort to implement a system of self-governance for villagers , granting villagers democratic rights to elect and supervise village leaders and decide village management , the official said ,
Under this system , the village leadership is obliged to publish financial reports regularly .
In some villages , special groups have been elected by villagers to examine and verify revenues and expenditures .
Transparent management of financial affairs has proved effective both for boosting the standardization of village financial affairs and preventing corruption , according to the official .
In the city of Shangqiu in Henan Province , around 180 million yuan in village funds was found to have been skimmed off when the new system was adopted , and so far , most of this lost money has been recovered .
The city of Kaiping in Guangdong Province used to be plagued by conflict between villagers and their leaders , but now there have been no reports from villagers accusing their leaders of financial misconducts for the past five years .
