Thailand to Control Quality of Private Schools
BANGKOK , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Education Ministry of Thailand is planning to introduce a quality control system for private schools , the Bangkok Post reported Sunday .
The measure is aimed at awarding a certificate of quality to 500 schools next year , the newspaper quoted a ministry official as saying .
Currently , only 41 out of about 6,000 private schools across the country have received the certificate .
The quality control system is expected to win back the public confidence in private schools following an incident in which five students from a private school gang-raped two girl students last Saturday .
The Education Ministry has instructed the Office of the Private Education Commission to send their officials to inspect the standards of teaching at every private school at least twice a year .
Emphasis will be given to the 22 blacklisted schools .
