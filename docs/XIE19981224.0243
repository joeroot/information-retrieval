Orders for Durable Goods Increase 1 Percent in November
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- New orders for costly durable goods like new cars and industrial machinery climbed in November by only 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted 190.7 billion U.S. dollars , partly erasing a 2.1 percent decline in October , said a report of the U.S. Commerce Department Wednesday .
Economists said the rise in orders for big-ticket items last month showed the U.S. economy 's underlying durability entering 1999 .
They said the manufacturing sector had been lagging due to weak exports , but the orders rise showed enough demand to forestall more interest-rate reductions by the Federal Reserve well into next year .
" Weak export markets and sagging corporate profits mean less capital spending , which in turn demonstrates the need for tax reductions to stimulate higher growth , " said Dave Huether , National Association of Manufacturers director of economic analysis .
The Commerce Depertment 's report of durable goods orders showed that manufacturing was likely to continue to slow in coming months , he added .
