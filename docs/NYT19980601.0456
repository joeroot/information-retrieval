ATLANTA _ His son was not even four , but Jeff Burroughs knew there was something special about him .
He knew when Sean could barely handle a fork and spoon but could pick up a bat , his little elbow cocked in perfect position , and whack one ball after another off a tee .
He knew when Sean was not even toilet-trained , but could stand 20 feet away and throw a baseball right into daddy 's glove .
Like the father of Tiger Woods , Jeff Burroughs , a former Braves player , knew .
`` Sean was so natural , even back then , '' Jeff said from his home in Long Beach , Calif. `` He picked things up so easily .
I guess you can say it was like he was born with a bat in his crib . ''
Of course , that 's really no surprise ; it 's all in the genes .
The older Burroughs , 48 , once was one of the major leagues ' best power hitters .
He won the American League MVP for the Texas Rangers in 1974 and then played in Atlanta in 1977 - 80 .
Today , his son is expected to be an early first-round pick in the amateur baseball draft , some 29 years after Jeff was the first overall choice , taken by the Washington Senators before they moved to Texas .
`` It 's like the same life all over again , '' Jeff said .
`` We 're real excited around here , especially because Sean has really moved up the ladder .
I don n't think anybody thought a year ago that he would be drafted in the top 10 . ''
And it 's Jeff who has made sure Sean has gotten to this point .
When he retired from baseball in 1985 , after hitting 240 home runs in 16 major-league seasons with five different clubs , he didn n't go to coach in the minor leagues like so many other ex-ballplayers do .
After making $ 300,000 in his last year in the majors , he had an adequate nest egg , so he began to coach Sean , who was seven .
A few years later , Jeff and Sean were together in the Little League World Series .
They won two titles , and during those days , Jeff said , `` I became more known for being Sean 's father instead of him being known as my son .
...
Let 's face it , it took me 20 years to finally make it to the World Series . ''
At that time , Sean was a 12-year-old throwing a 75-mph fastball and hitting 350-foot homers .
He routinely was walked intentionally .
The experience fostered a close relationship between the two .
`` He 's always given me pointers and told me things , '' Sean said .
`` I relished it when he did .
I still do . ''
But after Little League , others kids started to catch up with Sean .
The same thing happened to Marietta 's Marc Pisciotta , a Little League phenom who struggled during his high school and college years .
But Pisciotta persevered and made it to the majors , where he is a middle reliever for the Cubs .
`` All the success in Little League really put a lot of pressure on Sean to do well , '' Jeff said .
`` But I think this year he really blossomed . ''
At Wilson High in Long Beach , the same place where Jeff went to school , Sean hit . 507 with five homers and 29 RBIs .
He no longer pitches but plays a strong third base .
Baseball America rates Sean as the best pure high school hitter in the draft .
Paul Snyder , the Braves ' director of scouting and player personnel , has seen the younger Burroughs play .
`` He really handles himself well defensively , '' Snyder said .
`` He plays the game like a polished kid that has been around the professional scene . ''
But there are differences in father and son .
Jeff hit right-handed , while Sean swings from the left side , making him even more coveted by the pros .
Sean , a 6-foot-2 , 200-pounder , also is much leaner than his father was at the same age .
He is a better athlete , too , after playing soccer to enhance his agility and endurance .
Sean appears to be assured a top-10 spot , with the San Diego Padres showing interest with the No. 9 pick .
But even if Sean falls a few places , Jeff and he will become only the second father-son team to be taken in the first round ; the first were Tom and Ben Grieve .
And Sean 's signing bonus could be around $ 2 million , which would be almost as much as his father made his entire career .
Jeff received an $ 80,000 bonus .
But there 's also the scholarship Sean signed with Southern Cal .
If he can n't work out a deal with the team that selects him , the younger Burroughs might decide to go to college and try the draft again after his junior year .
