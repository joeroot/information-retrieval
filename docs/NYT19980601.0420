3 SEATTLE ARTISTS NAMED TO RECEIVE MACARTHUR ` GENIUS ' GRANTS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By JOHN MARSHALL c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
SEATTLE _ Three Seattle artists _ two writers who teach in the creative writing program at the University of Washington and a video artist _ are among the 29 winners of this year 's `` genius grant '' fellowships conferred by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago .
Seattle winners of the prestigious awards are Linda Bierds , a 53-year-old poet from Bainbridge Island who is chair of the UW 's creative writing program ; Charles Johnson , the 50-year-old novelist and National Book Award winner who also teaches in UW creative writing program ; and Gary Hill , a 47-year-old video artist with an international reputation .
The MacArthur awards , which are shrouded in secrecy and speculation , are intended to honor creativity in all fields of human endeavor .
They confer , over five years , a six-figure grant with no strings attached , in hopes of spurring time and resources for recipients to devote to their work .
The actual amount conferred is determined by the fellow 's age .
Bierds will receive a grant of $ 320 , 000 , Johnson $ 305,000 and Hill $ 290 , 000 .
Bierds and Johnson Monday expressed surprise and delight at their selection , which they learned of last Wednesday but had to keep secret until the awards were announced .
Hill was unavailable for comment Monday .
Bierds said she was in the midst of preparing a grilled cheese sandwich at her home when the call came from the MacArthur Foundation office .
`` The caller asked if I was familiar with the ` work of the foundation ' and , for one moment , I thought he was going to ask for a donation , '' Bierds related .
`` But when he then told me that I had been awarded a MacArthur fellowship , I immediately became incoherent , saying , ` Oh no !
Oh no !
I don n't believe it ! '' '
Johnson , who has had some dealings with the MacArthur Foundation in the past , returned a call on his answering machine from the foundation , with every expectation that he was going to be asked to give a comment on a prospective fellow .
When he himself turned out to be an award winner , Johnson kept his characteristic cool on the phone , but not after he hung up .
`` Then I fell apart , '' Johnson recalled .
`` I finally had to sit down and meditate in order to focus myself .
.
.
.
I felt like I won the lottery , even though I didn n't buy a ticket . ''
Bierds and Johnson were particularly thrilled to have two MacArthur winners from the small creative writing program in the UW 's Department of English _ which foundation officials described as `` a rare coicidence . ''
Richard Kenney , a poet who also teaches creative writing at the UW , is a past MacArthur fellow , which means that three of the 10 teachers in the small program ( 40 graduate students ) have now received this distinction .
Daniel Socolow , director of the MacArthur Foundation , said Monday , `` To have three fellows does say something about that program _ that is doing well indeed and must have some wonderfully talented people . ''
The MacArthur awards come at a particularly propitious time for the three Seattle winners .
An exhibition of Hill 's video work is now at the Donald Young Gallery on Capitol Hill , where it is the final exhibition before the gallery closes .
Hill is the 1995 winner of the Venice Biennale 's top prize for sculpture , among other awards .
In making the grant to Hill , the MacArthur Foundation praised the self-educated artist for being `` one of the major video artists of his generation . ''
It described him , in a written statement , as `` a formalist of the medium of video , noted for his precision , his capacity to structure illusion and space . ''
Bierds published her fifth volume of verse at the end of last year , `` The Profile Makers . ''
It is a powerful and profound meditation on various ways that images are captured , from paintings to silhouettes to code , with reflections as well on life , death , grief , war and family .
`` The Profile Makers , '' which Bierds wrote with the assistance of a Guggenheim Fellowship , has received the strongest praise of any of her collections .
Only two hours before the call from the MacArthur Foundation , Bierds received a call informing her that `` The Profile Makers '' has won the PEN / West prize for poetry from the writers organization .
The MacArthur Foundation praised Bierds as `` a poet whose attention to historical detail and to narratives of lyric description sets her apart from the prevailing contemporary styles . ''
It also said that `` her verse is clear , efficient and elegant . ''
`` What this MacArthur award has already done for me is give me such a boost of confidence , '' Bierds emphasized .
`` I 'm leaving for Europe next week for work on my next book and now I can n't wait to get started . ''
Johnson had recently returned to Seattle after completing an arduous national tour to 23 cities on behalf of his new novel , `` Dreamer , '' the first fictional treatment of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. This challenging intellectual novel focuses on King 's beliefs , especially the philosophical underpinnings of non-violence .
The MacArthur Foundation praised Johnson as an artist whose `` works address fundamental philosophical questions and transcend the boundaries of class , ethnicity and culture that separate us . ''
Johnson 's wide-ranging works ( from cartoons to screenplays to novels ) recently were the subject of their first book-length appraisal , `` Charles Johnson 's Spiritual Imagination '' ( University of Missouri Press , 172 pages , $ 19.95 ) by Jonathan Little .
Johnson won the 1990 National Book Award for his novel , `` Middle Passage , '' which examined the African slave trade .
Johnson said the MacArthur is far more significant to him than the National Book Award , especially since it honors people in many disciplines and also provides a degree of financial freedom .
`` I want to continue with my work , '' Johnson emphasized .
`` And I will get back to work , once this shock wears off . ''
The MacArthur Foundation has awarded 531 fellowships and spent $ 166 million on its `` genius grants '' since the program 's inception in 1981 .
Among the past winners are 10 people who live in the Seattle area : James F. Blinn , computer animation ; Thomas L. Daniel , biology ; Victoria E. Foe , biology ; Mott T. Greene , history ; Richard Kenney , poetry ; Suzanne D. Liebsock , history ; Margie J. Profet , biology ; John E. Toews , history ; Trimpin ( cq no first name ) , music ; Richard White , history .
The MacArthur Foundation has assets of $ 4 billion ( which makes it unlikely that it would be using telephone solicitation to seek donations from poets ) .
