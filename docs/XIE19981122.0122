Italian Parliament Approves 1999 Budget Bill
ROME , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Italian House of Representatives on Saturday approved the government 's budget bill for the 1999 fiscal year , consolidating the position in parliament of Prime Minister Massimo D ' Alema 's one-month long central left coalition .
The budget aims to ensure Italy 's social stability and appropriate economic growth after Europe 's single currency euro enters force on January 1 next year .
New measures include cutting public expenditure by 14.7 trillion lire ( some 8.9 billion U.S. dollars ) , raising pension and increasing job opportunities .
The item receiving the loudest applaud was the government 's announcement of a rebate of the " euro tax " by the end of this year .
Disputes over the previous draft of the 1999 budget touched off Italy 's latest cabinet crisis in early October that led to the resignation of Romano Prodi , D ' Alema 's predecessor .
