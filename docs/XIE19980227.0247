Thailand Expects 3 Billion Dollar Foreign Investment
BANGKOK , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Thailand expects to receive 3 billion U.S. dollars in foreign direct investment this year , The Bangkok Post Friday quoted Bank of Thailand 's Economic Research Department as saying .
Attracted by the lower prices of domestic assets brought by the depreciation of the baht and economic slowdown , foreign investors are likely to pour more money into several sectors , the research department said .
" Foreign investors are shopping for possible investment deals in many sectors of the economy .
Besides the financial sector , some have expressed interest in hotels and property , " Suchada Kirakul , deputy director of the department , said .
He predicted that the country will see an increase in foreign direct investment in the second half of the year as financial reform progresses .
The rise will spur economic growth , considering that adjustment loans from international agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank would be tapped by April , the director said .
