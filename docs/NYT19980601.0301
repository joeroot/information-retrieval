MUM 'S THE WORD
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By MARIANNE MEANS c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
WASHINGTON _ On the question of whether to testify under oath before a grand jury about his relationship with former White House aide Monica Lewinsky , President Clinton can not win .
The president has apparently decided to continue rejecting Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 's efforts to grill him about his contacts with Lewinsky and his knowledge of those mysterious 37 visits she paid to the White House after leaving her job there .
Although Clinton has already rebuffed at least four grand jury invitations for his voluntary testimony , Starr is currently stepping up his pressure to get the president on the witness stand .
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly said Sunday that subpoenaing the president or indicting him was an option being considered , an ominous hint of just how far Starr may be prepared to go .
But either draconian move would be both legally and politically dubious .
Most experts believe a sitting president can not be indicted .
Instead , the procedure used in cases of alleged presidential misconduct is impeachment .
And should Starr issue a subpoena to compel testimony , it would be a stunning , historic presidential first that could not be enforced .
( The constitutional separation of powers bars the judicial branch from imprisoning a sitting president . )
Such a move would risk not only an acrimonious standoff but ruin what remains of Starr 's tarnished professional reputation .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch predicts that Starr will not go that route , although Hatch would like to see Clinton voluntarily testify .
Hatch sees it as more of a political problem than a legal one and concedes he hopes that things don n't reach impeachment .
`` I 'd just as soon have this president finish his term , '' Hatch observes wryly , no doubt preferring that the Republicans run for president in 2000 with a diminished Clinton in the White House rather than Al Gore as a freshly anointed president .
Meanwhile , Clinton is buying time by keeping his mouth shut .
For him , testifying on this subject is a lose-lose situation .
He said at his last press conference : `` I think I 'm in some ways the last person who needs to be having a national conversation about this . ''
He has already vowed under oath in his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit and in public statements that he did not have an improper sexual affair with Lewinsky .
Editorial and Republican demands that he `` come forward with the truth '' are based on an assumption that he has not yet been honest , his denial is untrue , and that he has committed a criminal act of perjury and obstruction of justice .
His failure to contribute details to explain away the suggestive circumstances fuels such speculation .
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott added to the chorus on Monday , demanding the president `` be more forthcoming ...
give us more facts . ''
But there is nothing Clinton can do that is likely to make things easier for him .
His advisers complain that whatever he says in secret before a grand jury could be leaked in a distorted version by a biased Starr , making him look guilty .
But that 's not the real reason for resisting .
If Clinton has been telling the truth and did nothing wrong , he has a public obligation to put all the suspicions to rest by explaining things .
Remaining mum makes it look as though he is hiding out .
Still , nobody has been charged with anything yet .
Nobody knows what Starr knows or does not know .
The more details the president provides , the more opportunities for misunderstandings , accusations and political attacks .
If Clinton is lying and says more , he could be in danger of being contradicted by the evidence being collected by Starr .
If Clinton continues to deny all but Lewinsky cuts a deal and recants her own prior denial under oath , he will be caught up in a humiliating he-says-she-says argument in which she may be the more believable of the two .
But the prosecutor will have to prove which one is telling the truth .
If Lewinsky sticks to her denial , she may be indicted for perjury based on whatever evidence to the contrary Starr can produce .
That would give Starr the opportunity to call Clinton as a witness in a criminal trial , forcing him to repeat his own denial or invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent .
The spectacle of a president invoking the Fifth , normally the recourse of defendants who are guilty of something bad , would be legally feasible but politically disastrous .
If the president changes his tune and admits to an affair , he will have incriminated himself .
The core of Starr 's case will be made , although not necessarily the related allegation of subornation to perjury .
This is an unlikely scenario , however , given its unpleasant implications for impeachment .
