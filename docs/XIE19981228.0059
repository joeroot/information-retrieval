Netanyahu Faces More Challenges From Right Wing
JERUSALEM , December 28 ( Xinhua ) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was confronted with more challenges from the right wing Monday as a hard-line member of his coalition quitted the Likud and declared his candidacy for the premiership in the coming elections .
Benny Begin , the son of Likud founder Menachem Begin , announced that he will form a new party that will flank the Likud from the right in the elections .
He once served as science minister in Netanyahu 's government but resigned over differences in ideology and personality .
A hard-line lawmaker , Begin accused Netanyahu of turning his back to the credo of the Likud by signing a peace agreement with the Palestinians , saying he did not see essential difference between the Likud , the opposition Labor Party and centrist parties .
Begin was the third ranking figure in the Likud to challenge Netanyahu .
Another right-wing lawmaker Uzi Landau announced Sunday that he will run against the prime minister as the party leader , and former finance minister Dan Meridor left the Likud last week to form a new centrist party .
Begin 's declaration of candidacy came after Netanyahu got a boost Sunday when two of his major potential adversaries , Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon , announced that they will not challenge him for the leadership of the party .
Sources close to the prime minister said that efforts are being made to persuade Communications Minister Limor Livat and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to stay in the Likud .
The two ministers are said " on the verge of leaving . "
President Ezer Weizman met separately with Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak Monday , calling on the elections to be held as early as possible .
Representatives from the Likud and Labor will meet later Monday to decide an election date , which Israel Radio said will be possibly set in May .
For their parts , Meridor and former chief of staff General Amnon Lipkin-shahak met for more than one hour Monday .
Shahak , a formidable challenger to Netanyahu , has expressed his intention to join the centrist party Meridor will form , but said a decision will not be made until the election date is finalized .
