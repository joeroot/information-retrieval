South Africa 's Producer Inflation Up
JOHANNESBURG , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- South Africa 's annualized producer inflation rose to 4.8 percent in November from 4.2 percent in October , according to latest figures from Statistics South Africa .
South African Press Association Thursday quoted the organization as saying that the domestic month-on-month producer production index ( PPI ) rose 0.5 percent during the month , while the year-on-year increase was 4.1 percent .
The imported year-on-year PPI rose by 8.1 percent , up from 7.8 percent in October , said the organization .
Analysts said that the higher-than-expected producer inflation had been caused in part by a rise in imported oil prices .
However , these were expected to fall soon sharply .
Some economists predicted an average annual producer inflation of 3.5 percent in 1998 and 5.7 percent for 1999 .
