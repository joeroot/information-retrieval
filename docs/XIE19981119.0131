Fewer Female Smokers In China
BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- A study in China has found that the rate of smokers among China 's young women has dropped to the present one percent from ten percent in the 1950s .
But , researchers are unclear about the reasons for the decline and say that things are still far from encouraging because more males , especially youngsters , are taking up smoking and for many it is a lifetime habit .
Researchers say that cigarettes will kill 3 million people in China each year in 50 years if the smoking habits remain unchanged .
Now , cigarettes kill about a million every year .
The study was done by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine ( CAPM ) , the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences ( CAMS ) , Britain 's Oxford University , and the U.S. 's Cornell University .
They found that smoking-related deaths account for 3 percent of the deaths among females , compared with 12 percent among males .
Researchers predict that such ratio among females may drop to 1 percent by 2050 , while that among males may climb to 33 percent .
Women run almost the same risk of lung cancer and respiratory diseases as men .
Deaths from lung cancer among smokers , both male and female , were 3 times those among non-smokers , the researchers say .
