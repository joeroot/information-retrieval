Chinese Ministry Spokesman Says U.S. Remarks Are Unreasonable
BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation ( MOFTEC ) Spokesman Hu Chusheng said today that a remark made by a senior U.S. Commerce Department official recently was unreasonable .
The U.S. official charged that China 's tax refunds for some export commodities were in fact an export subsidy and covert currency devaluation , but , Hu said , this was neither a subsidy nor covert devaluation of the yuan .
According to the General Agreement of Tariff and Trade and the World Trade Organization , refunds for commodities can not be considered subsidies because they do not exceed the limit of taxes allowed for the products .
China 's export tax refund rate is only from 9 to 11 percent , which is below China 's legal tax rate of 17 to 13 percent , and much less than that of most countries , so the U.S. official 's remarks reflect a misunderstanding of China 's tax policy .
European and American countries all have export tax refund policies , the spokesman said .
The taxes and refunds of France were 26 percent .
Since 1995 , the Chinese government has lowered the export tax refund rate twice in accordance with the real tax rate and has increased tax collection controls in the past two years .
Its real tax rate is higher than before , which is why the government has raised some tax refund rates .
These were not directed at any particular countries , and were not a covert devaluation of the renminbi , he said .
China has paid a great price in not devaluing the renminbi , and has made an important contribution to the financial situation in Asia and stability of the global economy , the spokesman said , and the unreasonable remarks of the U.S. official harm the Asian economy 's normal order .
