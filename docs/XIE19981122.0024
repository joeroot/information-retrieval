CAIRO , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The Arab members of the Euro-Med partnership will seek a joint stance on fighting international terrorism before meeting with their European partners , an Egyptian official said Saturday .
The three-day meeting of the Euro-Med partnership due to start in Brussels on Monday will focus on anti-terror issues , Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Fathi al-Shazli said before leaving for the meeting .
Al-Shazli said Egypt will take part in a coordination meeting held Sunday by the other Arab members in the Euro-Med partnership , namely Algeria , Jordan , Lebanon , Morocco , the Palestinian National Authority , Syria and Tunisia .
Egypt has been heavily hit by terrorist acts since 1992 when Islamic militants began a violent campaign in an attempt to topple the secular government and install a strict Islamic rule .
