New Grain Distribution System Working In China
NANCHANG , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- More state-owned grain enterprises are improving as China 's grain distribution reform begins taking effect .
China started the reforms in April , stopping grain dealers from purchasing grain directly from peasants or doing wholesale business .
Jiangxi province observed state policies in providing better service , purchasing all surplus grain farmers offer , and paying cash on delivery .
As a result , sales of state-owned grain enterprises in the province are up 430 million kg from last year .
The province has closed 1,321 private grain wholesale shops and confiscated 9.47 million kg of illegally purchased grain , and grain companies have reported profits of 13.6 million yuan .
China 's state grain companies have lost more than 100 billion yuan over the past several years .
Nearly half the country 's grain was sold by state companies , whose poor operations made it difficult for them to guide grain prices or for the government to regulate the grain market and stop grain speculation .
" Because private enterprises sold grain at a low price , we had to sell at a price lower than what we paid peasants .
That 's why we are always losing money , " said one saleswoman at a state-owned grain company .
But , the present grain price is acceptable for one young woman who was buying grain at a shop , who says that if grain is always selling for less than the purchase price , the grain market will be in a chaos .
