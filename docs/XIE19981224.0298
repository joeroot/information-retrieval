Turkmenistan to Resume Gas Supply to Ukraine
MOSCOW , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Turkmenistan on Wednesday agreed to resume gas supplies to Ukraine after the two countries reached a compromise on payment .
Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov announced that the supply will start Thursday , after his meeting in Ashgabat with visiting Ukrainian President Kuchma , Interfax reported .
The two heads of state signed an agreement on the supply of 20 billion cubic meters of Turkmen gas to Ukraine in 1999 .
Interfax quoted Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister Batyr Sardzhayev as saying that under a 720 million U.S. dollar contract between the Ukrainian oil and gas company and the Turkmenistan state trade corporation , 40 percent of the gas will be paid in hard currency and 60 percent in goods and services .
Ashgabat had hoped to pay 50 percent of the gas in hard currency .
" Ukraine may count on Turkmen gas supplies in the next 350 years , " Niyazov told Kuchma .
He said that the explored resources of gas in Turkmenistan are estimated at 23 trillion cubic meters .
In 1999 Turkmenistan plans to export 31 billion cubic meters of gas , of which 20 billion cubic meters will go to Ukraine and 11 billion cubic meters to Iran .
Another accord , on gas transit with the Russian gas giant Gazprom , is expected to be signed in Moscow at the end of the week , Interfax said .
Kuchma expressed the hope that no problems would arise in dealing with Gazprom as Russia will only benefit from the resumption of Turkmen gas supplies .
According to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , Russia has lost 750 million dollars and Turkmenistan 1.8 billion dollars since gas supplies to Ukraine were terminated in March 1997 , Interfax said .
