BYRD PAYS A VISIT TO CHINESE GYMNAST
( jw ) By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ Dennis Byrd , walking with a slight limp _ the result of his near-tragic spinal-cord injury almost six years ago _ visited his old Jets team on Friday .
And then he went over to the nearby Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow and spent an hour and a half talking to the paralyzed Chinese gymnast , Sang Lan .
She suffered her injury Tuesday night while warming up for her specialty , the vault , in the Goodwill Games .
Byrd spoke to her at bedside through an interpreter .
Her condition remains `` critical , but stable , '' according to a hospital spokeswoman , and she will undergo extensive vertebrae surgery on Saturday , hours before her parents are scheduled to arrive from China .
It was not an uncommon moment for Byrd , whose ability to walk again after being completely paralyzed from a hit in a game has attracted the attention of many people similarly injured .
He said he writes hundreds of letters a year to those who have neck and spinal-cord injuries .
But he asked the Jets to arrange a personal visit with Sang .
`` She loves Beanie Babies , '' Byrd said after seeing the 17-year-old .
`` When you go to visit her , she 's a doll and she 'll break your heart . ''
In a late-season game against the Chiefs in 1992 , Byrd , the club 's best pass rusher , was trying to get to the quarterback .
With his head down , he inadvertently dug his helmet into the chest of a teammate , Scott Mersereau .
Byrd immediately knew he had been paralyzed , but the Jets ' medical staff quickly began a series of procedures on the field , including huge doses of steroids to stem the swelling around the spinal cord .
Two and a half months later he was able to walk into a news conference and talk about the experience .
`` It 's an emotional time any time you visit people who have undergone something so traumatic , '' Byrd said about his talk with Sang .
Byrd had not been around the Jets for more than a year .
But he wanted to visit the team and its coach , Bill Parcells .
Asked how he would have done under Parcells , Byrd said : `` I thought about that quite a bit .
I would have loved it .
I always enjoyed playing for someone who is very goal-driven . ''
Byrd now works with a foundation he created for children with life-threatening diseases , at P.O .
Box 90 , Owasso , Okla. 74055 .
The Wrath of Parcells & QL ;
Bill Parcells jumped on Kyle Brady , the tight end , who dropped two passes Friday .
Earlier this week , Parcells said that Brady was no longer the automatic incumbent , but in a competition with Fred Baxter .
Brady has maintained that in past years , the quarterbacks didn n't throw to him enough .
`` I keep reading about all your opportunities , '' Parcells shouted across the field .
`` That 's two you missed right there . ''
& QL ; But How About Interest ?
& QL ;
In case you were wondering about that $ 3.75 million salary advance that Neil O ' Donnell has not returned , be assured the check is in the mail .
At least that is what Bill Parcells said Friday .
`` We expect to receive the check by Federal Express on Saturday , '' he said .
Parcells even offered to let O ' Donnell 's accountant use the Jets ' Federal Express number .
O ' Donnell , cut last month , was supposed to return the money .
Overall , he earned more than $ 60,000 in money-market income since the first of two advances was made in February .
He earned $ 15,000 alone since the Jets cut him 30 days ago .
The Jets are getting a bit of that back by fining Marvin Jones $ 97 a pound for each day he is overweight .
He came in 10 pounds overweight and lost four before Friday 's workouts .
Visit Jets , See the World & QL ;
With players running just a few feet behind him , Petty Officer 1st Class Sean Carroll , a Jets fan since he watched Joe Namath , held up his right hand and re-enlisted in the Navy on the club 's practice field .
Wearing his uniform , the 32-year-old was sworn in by Cmdr .
Moira Flanders Wurzel , who said that the Navy tries to accommodate `` re-up '' requests at unusual sites .
Carroll even brought along his family .
Wurzel , who said she has had sailors re-enlist at the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty , said this was the first time it has happened on the athletic field .
Double Duty & QL ;
While center Kevin Mawae contends he hates to long-snap for the punters , Bill Parcells may not be so solicitous of his feelings .
`` His snapping could save us a roster spot , '' the coach said .
Right now , the Jets use John Hudson exclusively as a snapper .
