China Inspires Foreign Firms To Exploit Coalbed Methane
BEIJING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's fledging coalbed methane industry is expected to take off in the near future , thanks to a series of effective incentive , according to China Daily .
The China United Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd ( CUCBM ) has drilled 11 self-financed wells that indicate sound gas flows , said Sun Maoyuan , vice-president of the company .
North China 's Shanxi Province , which possesses about one-quarter of China 's total coalbed methane reserves , wishes to promote comprehensive co-operation with the company to shape the coalbed methane sector as one of its pillar industries , Sun noted .
Sun said that five contracts between CUCBM and three US companies have been implemented smoothly , and it is now negotiating with several foreign partners to expand co-operation to Jiangxi , Xinjiang and other areas .
Dozens of foreign companies expressed strong enthusiasm in the investment , but they said incentives offered by the Chinese government are inadequate , and infrastructure for coalbed methane transportation and distribution is non-existent .
They suggest that China should implement more favourable incentives for coalbed methane exploitation than for conventional natural gas and oil , since it carries higher risks , higher front-end costs , and longer payback periods .
The enterprises can enjoy import duty exemption and a low value-added tax rate of only 5 percent , according to Li Hongxun , an official with the State Development Planning Commission .
Coalbed methane is an unconventional form of natural gas .
To prevent gas explosions , 6 billion cubic metres of methane are expelled from China 's mines annually , seriously polluting the environment and wasting energy resources .
China 's coalbed methane reserves , estimated at 30 to 35 trillion cubic metres , are located about 2,000 metres underground .
And CUCBM aims to produce 10 billion cubic metres annually by 2010 .
