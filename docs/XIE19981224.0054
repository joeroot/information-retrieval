Pak Calls for Complete End to Foreign Interference
ISLAMABAD , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Pakistan believes that the main pre-requisite for the formation of a multi-ethnic government in Afghanistan is " complete stoppage of outside interference . "
The view was expressed Thursday by Foreign Office Spokesman Tariq Altaf at the weekly press briefing Thursday .
The Spokesman said that the ground situation in Afghanistan presents a unique opportunity to achieve durable peace through the formation of a multi-ethnic government in that war-battered country .
" However , the main pre-requisite for that is complete stoppage of outside interference , " he added .
Pakistan stands by its principled position of seeking durable peace in Afghanistan far from being isolated , and continues to play a pivotal role in this regard , Altaf said .
Pakistan , he noted , also remains in constant contact with all Afghan parties , and Pakistan 's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju has visited four Central Asian Republics in August and November this year in efforts to achieve a durable peace in the war-torn Afghanistan .
Talking about the on-going visit here by Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov , the Spokesman said Nazarov 's visit is part of the extensive exchanges of views that Pakistan is having with countries interested in the Afghan issue .
He noted that Pakistan has recently held discussions with the U.S. , Japan , China , Russia and other countries on the afghan issue .
