U.S. Urges Israel to Exercise Restrain on Lebanon
JERUSALEM , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States urged Israel to exercise restraint in its policy on the Lebanese issue , Israel Radio reported Sunday .
U.S. ambassador to Israel Edward Walker relayed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday afternoon Washington 's concern over the recent developments in South Lebanon , it said .
Walker urged both Israel and Lebanon to show restraint because any more military action in the region could lead to further complication of the situation , the radio said .
Several Israeli cabinet ministers called Sunday for air strikes against Lebanon in retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers by Islamic guerillas in South Lebanon .
The ministers issued the call before attending a meeting called by Netanyahu , who returned home Friday from his interrupted European tour , to assess the situation in South Lebanon .
The meeting , known as the security cabinet meeting , will hear military and security chiefs ' reports on the Lebanon situation and formulate Israel 's policy toward Lebanon .
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon , member of the security cabinet , has called for a staged withdrawal from South Lebanon but added that the Lebanese government should be held responsible for Hezbollah attacks from the areas which Israel have evacuated .
If the Lebanese government fails to prevent these anti-Israeli attacks , Israel could target Lebanese power stations , water pumping facilities , bridges and roads , he warned .
Other ministers Sunday voiced support for attacks on Lebanese civilian facilities in retaliation for the recent stepped-up Lebanese guerilla campaign in which seven Israeli soldiers were killed in 10 days .
However , the Israeli armed forces are concerned that Israeli air strikes against Lebanon would lead to an escalation of the conflict .
Two Israeli soliders were killed by Hezbollah militia in the security zone Thursday , bringing the death toll in 10 days to seven .
With rising casualties of Israeli troops in the region , nearly half of the Israelis now prefer Israeli army 's pullout from the security zone , which Israel set up in South Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern territories from guerilla attacks .
