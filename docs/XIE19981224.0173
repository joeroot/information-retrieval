Sri Lanka 's Plans to Deploy Women Pilots Postponed
COLOMBO , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Sri Lanka 's plans to deploy women pilots has been put on hold while male pilots are being trained instead to take their places , informed sources said Thursday .
However , no final decision has been made with regard to the recruitment of female pilots , sources said .
The Sri Lanka Air Force earlier this year decided to recruit women pilots after a series of terrorist attacks and unexplained accidents resulted in the loss of over 20 pilots .
Over 800 women responded to advertisements calling for trainee women pilots .
After interviews nine of them were selected for training .
But no one was taken into the Air Force , sources said , adding they would be recruited only after further tests .
