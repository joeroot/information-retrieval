S. Lankan Farmers Warned to Protect Crops from Bugs
COLOMBO , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The Agriculture Ministry of Sri Lanka has warned farmers to protect their crops from the paddy bug , a familiar pest which could damage young crops this season , the official Daily News reported Thursday .
The pest has already ruined crops in several parts of the country , specially in Eastern Province , a ministry spokesman was quoted as saying .
Paddy bugs live in nearby bushes and undergrowth and the female insect returns to young paddy plants to lay eggs , said the spokesman , adding it sucks juice from paddy plants and later from the pods and seeds thereby destroying the entire cultivation .
The pest , which belongs to the bug species , is light green and brown , stinking and easy to identify , the spokesman said .
Farmers have been urged to identify places where the bugs dwell and destroy them by spraying various chemicals , the reports added .
