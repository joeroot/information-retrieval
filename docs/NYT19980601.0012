AT BRONX HOSPITAL , SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES FACE NEW OBSTACLE

NEW YORK _ As refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia began trickling into the Bronx about 15 years ago , their minds and bodies scarred by war , Montefiore Medical Center , a private hospital with a long history of serving immigrant and indigent New Yorkers , established a clinic to serve them .
The federally subsidized clinic in East Fordham employed full-time interpreters speaking Vietnamese and Khmer , the Cambodian language .
The interpreters scheduled the refugees ' appointments , helped them communicate with doctors and stood by them through Pap smears , X-rays , MRIs and other unfamiliar rituals of Western medicine .
But in April , because of financial pressures , the hospital reassigned its two full-time interpreters to clerical jobs .
It now relies on eight employees fluent in Khmer or Vietnamese who work in other jobs at the clinic _ from filing medical records to serving as medical assistants _ to translate as needed .
The change has unleashed a flurry of protest by advocacy groups and prompted an investigation by federal civil rights officials into whether refugee patients are being denied ready access to interpreters _ something Montefiore must provide as a condition of receiving federal aid .
Larry Velez , a spokesman for the office of civil rights at the federal Department of Health and Human Services , said his office 's inquiry , which began after clinic staff members and patients filed a complaint , was the first in recent memory examining the civil rights of non-English-speaking patients at a New York City hospital .
The investigation at Montefiore , which has long been considered a leader in caring for immigrant New Yorkers , is being watched closely by other health care providers and by immigrants ' advocates , who hope to use it as leverage to bolster their demands that hospitals and clinics improve their interpreting services .
Most of the city 's hospitals and clinics rely on a patchwork of bilingual staff members , volunteers and , at times , the children of patients to do translation , said Francesca Gany , executive director of the New York Immigrant Task Force on Health .
This ad hoc system frequently breaks down , she said , sowing confusion and making the diagnosis and treatment of immigrants ' health problems much more difficult .
`` I do hope that because of this , '' Ms. Gany said of the inquiry , `` facilities will look at themselves more closely and do what has to be done . ''
Over the last several years , civil rights inquiries around the country have prompted changes in the way health care providers offer translation for patients .
In Colorado , the state social services agency was cited for allowing the friends and family members of patients to translate during psychiatric evaluations .
In a statement , officials at Montefiore said the hospital remained `` committed to providing quality care to all of our patients , regardless of nationality or the language they speak . ''
Of the 53,000 patient visits there in 1997 , roughly 8 percent were by Cambodians or Vietnamese .
One patient , El Hong , 48 , said that when he stumbled into the clinic recently with severe diarrhea and stomach pain , he waited seven hours until a translator could be found and he could be seen by a physician .
Hong later recalled the event , speaking through a translator .
He shook his head and said he did not know how he would cope without the guidance of Ni Yann , a former translator who has been reassigned as a medical records clerk .
Hong , a former Cambodian soldier who has suffered seizures ever since he was injured by a bomb blast in 1970 , has high blood pressure .
His right thigh , punctured by a piece of shrapnel , frequently swells up .
He takes medication to control the seizures and sees a psychiatrist once a month .
Ms. Yann had always scheduled his visits to doctors _ usually twice a month _ and called with reminders .
`` My life , '' he added , `` depends on a translator . ''
Government guidelines require all federally financed hospitals and clinics to `` have ready access to , and provide services of , proficient interpreters in a timely manner . ''
But the guidelines do not require all institutions to employ full-time interpreters .
They can rely instead on bilingual staff members or a pool of qualified volunteers or they can contract with outside interpreters .
Montefiore officials said that at its two Bronx hospitals , a bank of volunteer interpreters and bilingual staff members , who represent 44 languages , provide translation as needed .
Several staff members at the clinic on 193rd Street said the reassignments were inefficient , forcing them to scramble to find bilingual employees who may be busy tending to other tasks and forcing their patients to wait .
On Dr. Zach Rosen 's shift a couple of weeks ago , for instance , an elderly Cambodian woman with a history of hypertension came into his office for a scheduled visit ; neither spoke the other 's language .
So , while the patient waited , Rosen said he ran around looking for a medical assistant on the floor who spoke Khmer .
She , as it turned out , was busy translating for another physician down the hall .
`` It gets in the way of seeing people effectively , '' he said .
Some staff members also said the full-time interpreters were crucial in offering a sense of safety to refugees still traumatized by war and dislocation .
A nurse practitioner , Nancy Tenney , said an elderly Cambodian woman who had recently been assaulted came in complaining of numbness in her arm .
Ms. Tenney suggested an MRI , but when the patient was told that Ms. Yann would be unable to accompany her , she refused the test .
