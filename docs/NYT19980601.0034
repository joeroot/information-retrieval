LAWYERS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING DROPPING PART OF CLINTON FIGHT

WASHINGTON _ President Clinton 's lawyers are considering whether to drop his planned appeal of a federal judge 's rejection of his claims of executive privilege in the investigation into his relationship with a former intern , people familiar with their deliberations said on Sunday night .
The lawyers planned to make a final decision Monday , administration officials said , in time to meet a 4 : 30 p.m. deadline imposed by the Supreme Court for a response to a request by Kenneth Starr , the independent prosecutor , to speed up the appeals process .
Under this new legal strategy , Clinton would continue to appeal some of Starr 's questioning , but only by invoking his attorney-client privilege , Clinton 's allies said on Sunday night .
White House lawyers could argue that Clinton 's use of the attorney-client privilege raised no constitutional issues and therefore would not require the extraordinary kind of accelerated review that Starr has requested .
The federal judge , Norma Holloway Johnson , had consolidated the two privilege claims in her ruling .
In effect , by switching strategies now , Clinton would be claiming victory and withdrawing .
All along , the White House has insisted that it was simply out to uphold the principle that the president is entitled to an executive privilege , a position that Judge Johnson upheld even as she ruled that in this instance Starr 's need pursue his investigation outweighed that privilege .
Starr has asked the Supreme Court to short-circuit the normal appellate process and consider a White House appeal right away .
His request put the White House in the difficult position of possibly opposing such an expedited review , a move that officials acknowledged would lend weight to criticism that Clinton was trying to impede the investigation .
By dropping the appeal of executive privilege altogether , the White House would avoid that fight , without depriving the president of the shield of attorney-client privilege .
The tentative new White House strategy was reported in the early editions on Sunday night of The Washington Post .
Clinton has invoked the privileges to prevent Starr from compelling testimony from two senior aides , Sidney Blumenthal , a senior communications adviser , and Bruce Lindsey , the deputy White House counsel .
If Clinton dropped his appeal on executive privilege , Starr could call Blumenthal to testify immediately .
But Clinton may invoke attorney-client privilege to block some questioning of Lindsey .
The Supreme Court has granted expedited review only a handful of times this century , in cases like labor strikes or when crimes have been committed .
Jim Kennedy , a White House spokesman , said , `` No final decision is expected until the attorneys meet at least one more time , most likely tomorrow morning . ''
