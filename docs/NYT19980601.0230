AMID WORLD CUP NOISE , PARIS OFFERS THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By MIKE GREENBERG c.1998 San Antonio Express-News
PARIS _ Paris always has plenty of music , theater and dance in June and July , but the usual menu is being expanded for the World Cup of Soccer .
The big event is a July 12 concert by the Three Tenors , with the Orchestre de Paris under James Levine , on the Champ de Mars near the Eiffel Tower .
Some odd pairings of sport and culture are promised .
For example , while soccer fans await the final match in the Stade de France , they are to be treated to a parade of 300 fashion models in a 40-year retrospective of the fashions of Yves Saint-Laurent .
The annual Fete de la Musique , with free public concerts of all sorts in many of Paris ' major plazas on June 21 , will have extended hours this year , till 2 a.m.
Also occurring during the period of the World Cup are the IRCAM Festival of contemporary and experimental music ( June 12 - 26 ) ; Paris Opera productions of `` Manon '' and `` La Traviata '' ; a Moliere festival ( opening June 11 ) ; a tango festival ( June 12 - 14 ) ; the New Tendencies in Jazz Festival ( June 12-July 13 ) ; and Gay Pride ( June 17 - 21 ) .
Music is as near as the corner subway stop : In stations and on trains , the rider may encounter a violinist and accordionist playing Vivaldi 's `` The Four Seasons , '' a performer alternating on vocals and alto sax ( with the aid of a portable rhythm machine ) in `` Besame Mucho '' ; or a string orchestra playing the `` Carmen '' fantasy .
These are officially sanctioned Metro musicians , chosen through auditions , and some of them are astonishingly good .
Riders are invited to drop a few coins in a cup or change purse , but no pressure is applied .

Advertising in the subway stations leans heavily toward cultural events _ Marivaux 's `` The Game of Love and Luck '' at Nanterres Amandieres ; Chekhov 's `` The Cherry Orchard '' at the Salle de Richelieu ; Berg 's `` Wozzeck '' at the Chatelet ; Stuck Mojo and Rocket from the Crypt at the Zenith .
The Pompidou Center is closed for renovations until the end of 1999 , but the big plaza in front still draws throngs of tourists and street performers .
The Notre Dame cathedral is open , although the lower portion of the facade is veiled in scaffolding for a major cleaning and repair project .
Also open is the Louvre , the splendid art museum .
Tops among recent architecture is the City of Music , new home of the Paris Conservatoire and related institutions .
Designed by prize-winning architect Christian de Portzamparc , the complex is notable for its fluid , sinuous lines , its sense of processional movement , and forms that can be described only as musical .
Also worth seeing is `` Paristoric , '' an excellent overview of Parisian history and architecture in beautifully photographed slides , multilingual narration and music , opposite the Opera Garnier .
Of course , not everything can be crammed into less than an hour , so the program doesn n't mention a few minor details , such as two world wars .

While the new Stade de France in suburban Saint-Denis will get the lion 's share of attention during the World Cup , Paris itself has an attractive venue in the Parc des Princes .
Five preliminary matches and the July 11 semifinal are to be played in this 49,000-seat stadium , a former velodrome renovated for soccer and rugby in 1972 .
A bowl resting on gracefully curving concrete fins , it 's the home pitch of Paris-Saint-Germain , the city 's pro soccer team .
All new seats and technical improvements were added for the World Cup .
The Parc des Princes is located just inside the Paris city limits , atop the Peripherique expressway near the Bois du Boulogne .
Surrounding the stadium is an uncommonly pleasant , quiet and prosperous neighborhood of art deco and international style architecture .
A few steps from the stadium , a historical marker directs the eyes to architect Raymond Fischer 's Villa Godfray , a tautly disciplined modernist box , built in 1927 , whose white exterior is softened only by an aged but richly blossoming wisteria .
