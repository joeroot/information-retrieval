MONTCLAIR , N.J .
_ Jets fans who have been listening for signs of great things from their team must have been filled with pride and hope Wednesday as Bill Parcells outlined his vision of an aggressive organization plunging toward a new millennium .
`` I have watched these organizations of the '90s build themselves _ the Dallas Cowboys , the Green Bay Packers _ and they have all been pro-active in the personnel area , '' he said as the Jets waved goodbye to one quarterback , Neil O ' Donnell , and welcomed another , Vinny Testaverde .
`` They have not been , ` Sit back , lay back , we 'll improve by the draft . ' None of those teams relied totally on one aspect to improve their team .
I 've become educated that way , I 've seen champions built that way and we 're going to be a proactive organization . ''
Parcells was saying that the Jets , cautiously regarded as a rising power in the American Football Conference East , will be aggressive in building the foundation of a championship team .
The worrisome thing about the comments was the context in which they were being made : a hastily called news conference to announce that the Jets had effectively erased a major mistake .
The overpriced O ' Donnell was being waived , freeing up substantial salary cap money ; the priced-to-sell Testaverde was being signed .
This was the final resolution of Parcells ' shattered relationship with O ' Donnell , and of the six-month game of financial chess between O ' Donnell and the Jets .
This can be traced back to the bizarre season-ending game in December when Parcells , in a feud of ego and principle with O ' Donnell , pulled his quarterback and opted to use the untested Ray Lucas and a rookie running back to throw passes in crucial situations with the Jets on the edge of the playoffs .
As much as anything , that led to Wednesday 's news conference .
There was the slightest hint of contrition Wednesday as Parcells spoke about O ' Donnell .
`` I 'm disappointed in part of the way this has gone on , '' he said , `` because I do have a high regard for him personally .
If someone came in and tried to cut my salary , I probably wouldn n't like it either .
He 's been a good quarterback in this league .
But looking at the big picture for us , I just felt that this was a better fit .
`` He 's a fine young man , but sometimes , things just change . ''
Mistakes are part of life , certainly part of the business of picking personnel in sports .
The tragedy of the Jets ' mistakes is that they have tended to resonate so deeply into the future : Hiring a bad coach and then staying too long with that coach ; allowing the front office to spend far too much money on a player .
The Jets signed O ' Donnell for $ 25 million and everyone _ except the Jets _ knew that the organization had made a costly blunder .
Don n't blame O ' Donnell ; if he was being greedy , the Jets fed him .
O ' Donnell was good enough to take a very good Pittsburgh team to the Super Bowl , and he could have been exactly what the Jets needed .
They simply paid far too much for it , and tied up all the money they needed to fit more pieces into the puzzle .
Except that they didn n't see a puzzle .
Finally , after two dismal seasons , the Jets effectively asked O ' Donnell to help them rectify their mistake by taking a pay cut .
He said no , and the Jets found themselves in a corner .
In February , Parcells said that he wasn n't interested in Testaverde .
Wednesday he said that at the time , Testaverde was under contract .
The problem with that is that the Ravens had given Testaverde permission to talk with other teams .
Testaverde is a 6-foot-5-inch , 225-pound escape hatch .
The Jets go into the season with Glenn Foley , Testaverde and either Lucas or Chuck Clements at the crucial quarterback position .
Foley is a fan favorite , though there are serious questions _ doubts , actually _ about his durability .
When a reporter asked a question that implied that Foley is the Jets ' starting quarterback , Parcells barked , `` I said Foley was going to get the benefit of the doubt , don n't put words in my mouth . ''
Parcells said he told Testaverde that if he performs at a level `` that 's obviously better , '' the job is his .
The news conference finally broke up , and Parcells went back to what was left of his vacation with a considerable weight off his shoulders .
The Jets are free of O ' Donnell 's salary , saving $ 2.75 million against the salary cap ; O ' Donnell is free from Parcells .
The new quarterback is happy to be liberated from his own unwanted freedom .
For now , everyone _ except perhaps Jets fans _ can breathe a little easier .
