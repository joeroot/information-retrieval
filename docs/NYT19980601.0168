ORIOLES DOWN RANGERS , SELE , 6 - 3
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By JOHNNY PAUL c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
BALTIMORE _ Left-handed hitters often served as a source of torment for right-hander Aaron Sele during 1997 .
Those demons appeared exorcised during his first nine starts this season with the Rangers .
The past two appearances suggest otherwise .
Sele , who last night failed in his bid to become the major leagues ' first nine-game winner , surrendered home runs to two left-handed hitters during the first three innings of Baltimore 's 6 - 3 victory at Oriole Park at Camden Yards .
`` I buried this team early , '' Sele said after the Rangers ' fifth consecutive loss and his shortest appearance this season .
`` I put us down five runs . ''
Left fielder B.J. Surhoff and designated hitter Harold Baines , two of five players in the Orioles ' lineup who hit left-handed against Sele , sent two curveballs on 400-foot journeys .
Surhoff 's three-run blast consummated the Orioles ' four-run first inning , and Baines connected for a one-out , solo home run during the third inning that gave the Orioles a 5 - 0 advantage .
Sele ( 8 - 3 ) silenced left-handed hitters routinely during his first nine starts .
Left-handed batters hit only . 229 ( 32-for-140 ) against him during that span .
However , left-handed batters produced a . 478 batting average ( 11-for-23 ) against Sele during his past two starts .
`` I 'm just not making quality pitches , '' Sele said .
`` It doesn n't matter if you 're left-handed or right-handed .
You throw too many pitches in poor locations and not too many good things are going to happen . ''
Second baseman Roberto Alomar , a switch hitter , drove the Orioles ' first run home with a two-out double to right field , and Baines advanced to third on the extra-base hit .
That brought Surhoff to the plate with first base unoccupied .
Rangers manager Johnny Oates considered pitching around Surhoff with Cal Ripken , a right-handed hitter , on deck .
The Rangers didn n't , and Surhoff capitalized .
`` You can n't expect to give up three-run homers and expect to win very often , '' said Sele , who allowed five runs on seven hits during 32 / 3 innings .
Oates removed Sele with a two-out , bases-loaded situation with Baines again at-bat during the fourth inning .
Sele pitched well in his previous start May 23 at The Ballpark in Arlington .
Sele earned the victory against the Kansas City Royals with a complete-game effort , but signs of trouble appeared .
The first three batters in the Royals ' lineup featured two left-handed hitters ( center fielder Johnny Damon and designated hitter Hal Morris ) and a switch hitter ( second baseman Jose Offerman ) .
That collection combined to go 6-for-11 with two extra-base hits .
Sele blamed command of his best pitch _ the curveball _ for his difficulty last night .
`` I was just inconsistent , '' he said .
`` I 'd throw a couple of good ones and then leave then next one letter - or belt-high .
You can n't afford to do that . ''
The Rangers ' struggles at the plate also continued .
The heart of the order _ left fielder Rusty Greer , right fielder Juan Gonzalez and catcher Ivan Rodriguez _ produced only an infield single during its 10 at-bats .
Greer drove in one of the Rangers ' runs with a fifth-inning sacrifice fly .
`` We just don n't have that sustained offense right now that we 've become accustomed to this year , '' Oates said .
`` Guys at the top are getting on .
Guys at the bottom are swinging at pitches , but we 're not getting much from the middle .
That 's what we 've come to depend on . ''
