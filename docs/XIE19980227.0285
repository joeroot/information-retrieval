Irish Prime Minister Vows to Keep Peace Talks on Track
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Irish Prime Minister Berti Ahern vowed Thursday to keep the Northern Ireland peace process on track despite a recent spate of bombings and shootings in the British-ruled province .
After hour-long talks in London with his British counterpart Tony Blair , Ahern told reporters that " We can not allow people who are not interested in democracy and not interested in finding an overall settlement to derail the process " .
It was reported that the two prime ministers discussed the prospects for an agreement at the peace talks following their decision last week to suspend the Irish Republican Army 's political wing Sinn Fein until March 9.
Police said the IRA was involved in two recent shootings in Northern Ireland .
The Irish Prime Minister said that he hoped Britain and Ireland would be able to come up with separate papers to present to the peace talks within the next three to four weeks .
