Thailand Moves to Achieve APEC Target
Representatives from the Thai ministries of commerce , industry , finance and foreign affairs will meet at the end of this month to discuss issues of products , time frame and final tariff rates in liberalizing the trade with 17 other APEC member economies .
Thailand 's revision plan follows a recent meeting of APEC senior officials in Kuantan , Malaysia , which failed to break the deadlock in the realization of the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization plan that APEC leaders agreed to adopt last year .
The plan requires members to open up trade in nine priority areas with the target of eliminating tariffs by 2005 .
They are chemical , energy , environmental goods and services , fish and fisheries , forestry , gems and jewelry , medical equipment , toys and telecommunications .
Thailand confirmed its intention to participate in all sectors but wants to reserve tariff rates of between zero and 5 percent for a number of sensitive products in each sector .
With this plan , Thailand will only meet the APEC requirement in the gems and jewelry sector , which will be traded at the final tariff rate of zero to 5 percent in 2005 .
Trade in other sectors will be freed up between 2005 and 2019 , according to the officials .
Thailand 's reluctance to conform with the APEC end-date and end-rate in other sectors drew criticism at the APEC meeting in Kuantan , Malaysia .
To bridge the gap with APEC 's plan , Thailand could begin reducing tariffs from 2003 or 2004 , an official said on condition of anonymity .
Thailand said earlier that it has set 2005 as the starting point for reducing tariffs because it wants the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) to enjoy similar privileges under the grouping 's free trade area which is due to begin operation in 2003 .
It also wants maximum flexibility in terms of the APEC time frame , which allows developing countries to liberalize trade by 2020 to boost revenue from collecting import tax .
Developed countries are set to free up trade by 2010 .
APEC members have to submit their revised plan by the end of October to Malaysia which is hosting the APEC leaders meeting in mid-November .
