Did Acid Rain Kill the Dinosaur ?
( 1 )
BEIJING , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese archeologists have recently found new clues from fossilized dinosaur eggs leading them to believe that it may have been acid rain that killed off the dinosaurs more than 65 million years ago .
Doctor Deng Tao of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences , said today that chemical analysis of the fossilized dinosaur eggshells unearthed in the Shanyang Basin in northwest China 's Shaanxi Province contains an unusually high amount of the trace element strontium .
He explained that a high strontium content in the body of an animal causes holes in the bones and slows down the growth of the animal .
" Experiments show that if hens eat forage containing strontium to a level 30 percent more than usual , the eggshell will be thin and fragile , and chickens will not hatch , " said Deng .
Chemical analysis shows that the content of strontium in the dinosaur eggshells in Shanyang Basin increased from 0.06 percent in the early years of the Cretaceous period to 1 percent at the end of the period .
In addition , the strontium content in the dinosaur eggs found in the Nanxiong Basin in south China 's Guangdong Province is also as high as 0.1 percent to 0.38 percent , said Deng .
" We found that the dinosaur eggshells in the Shanyang Basin at the end of Cretaceous period is very thin , with more holes , a phenomenon similar to the one in the chicken experiment , " said Deng , adding that a dinosaur diet containing too much strontium could have caused the dinosaurs to lay eggs that would not hatched .
