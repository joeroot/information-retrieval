Botswana Deploys More Troops on Namibian Border :
JOHANNESBURG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Botswanan government has deployed more troops along the Namibian border where two disputed islands are located , South African Press Association ( SAPA ) quoted a Namibian newspaper as reporting Friday .
In an interview , Namibian Defense Minister Erikki Nghimtina said the move appeared to be in line with Botswana 's initial plans of erecting camps manned by its troops every 10 kilometers stretching from the disputed island of Situngu to the border located near the Mahangu game reserve .
Nghimtina declined to reveal the number of troops , citing security reasons , but said that during a recent visit to the area he had verified initial reports that the Botswanan Defense Force ( BDF ) had stationed more troops in the area .
He said that under normal circumstances Botswana should have notified its neighbors , including Namibia , about its current military activities to ensure that neighboring states are not alarmed .
Asked about reports that the BDF had escalated its military exercises and ground maneuvers within Botswana and that a number of explosions were being heard from a remote area being used for military activities , the minister said , " We also heard something like that -- they are training and making some military exercises . "
He said his office was not informed that there are some military activities going on in Botswana .
This is also creating suspicion as to why they are doing it , he said , adding the latest developments had aroused concern in the Southern African Development Community .
Namibia and Botswana are disputing the ownership of Situngu and Kasikili islands in the Chobe River .
Despite diplomatic efforts to resolve the twin issues , Botswana has reportedly stationed troops on both islands .
The two sides failed to reach an agreement last month on Botswanan troops ' withdrawal from Situngu , but agreed to set up a joint technical committee to look into the issue .
They are waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague over Kasikili , which is called Sedudu by Botswana .
