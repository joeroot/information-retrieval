POSTAL SERVICE RANKS TOP 30 DOG-BITE CITIES
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Postal Service marked the start of National Dog Bite Prevention Week on Monday by identifying the 30 U.S. cities where Postal Service employees were most frequently bitten by dogs .
The list ranks Houston as the No. 1 city , with 65 dog bites in the 12 months ending September 1997 , followed by the Chicago area with 55 bites and the Miami area with 36 .
More than 2,700 letter carriers were bitten during that period , according to the Postal Service .
Carriers are equipped with pepper spray to ward off attacking dogs , a fact that helps account for the recent reduction in dog bite victims among letter carriers .
In the mid-1980s , more than 7,000 carriers suffered dog bites annually .
During National Dog Bite Prevention Week , post offices around the nation will coordinate with local humane societies and animal care and control officials on public education about avoiding dog bites .
The Postal Service offers this advice on how to avoid a dog bite :
_ Don n't run past a dog .
Its natural instinct is to chase and catch prey .
_ If a dog threatens you , don n't scream .
_ Avoid eye contact , try to remain motionless until the dog leaves , then back away slowly until the dog is out of sight .
_ Always let a dog see and sniff you before you pet the animal .
The Postal Service gives these pointers to `` responsible dog owners '' :
_ Don n't assume your dog won n't bite .
_ Spay or neuter your dog _ unneutered dogs are three times more likely to bite .
_ When your letter carrier comes to your home , keep your dog inside , away from the door in another room or on a leash .
_ Don n't let your child take mail from the letter carrier in the presence of your dog .
Your dog 's instinct is to protect the family .
