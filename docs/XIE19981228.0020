S. African Deputy President Warns Against Abuse
JOHANNESBURG , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki Sunday sent a strong warning to South Africans against the misuse of the country 's newly found democracy .
Political liberty did not mean freedom to rape , to steal other people 's property , to stay away from work or to do as one pleased , Mbeki said at a rally in Idutywa in the Eastern Cape .
He said it was sad to note that the advent of democracy had seen a general decline of moral values , reported the South African Press Association .
He said : " Today we have among members of the African National Congress ( ANC ) town mayors and councillors who aspire to leadership positions . "
" Not because they are committed to serve their communities but because they want to line their pockets with ill-found financial reaches . "
Mbeki , who is ANC president , appealed for political discipline among members of the organization .
The ANC should make 1999 a year of change , a year in which change was sought even in the manner the country was ruled , he said .
The rally at Mbeki 's birth place in Ngcingwana village is a coming-home celebration organized by his tribal clan before he takes over from President Nelson Mandela as executive head of the country next year .
