China Expresses Regret , Indignation over Tokyo Supreme Court Verdict
BEIJING , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- China today expressed regret and indignation once again over the erroneous verdict of the Tokyo Supreme Court of Japan in the case of the diary of Shiro Azuma regarding historical facts .
" The verdict of the Supreme Court has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people , " said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao here today .
Zhu added that historical facts can not be denied , and the heinous crimes committed during the aggression against China launched by the Japanese militarists can not be obliterated .
Shiro Azuma was a former Japanese soldier and witnessed the infamous " Nanking Massacre " in December 1937 .
Zhu made the remarks when asked to comment on the recent speech by a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry concerning the case , in which he claimed that this case was just a civilian suit , not a suit related to whether the " Nanking Massacre " occurred or not , or a suit concerning the complete picture of the " Nanking Massacre . "
The spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry also said the Japanese government believes that the undeniable fact is that the old Japanese army killed civilians and engaged in pillage after they entered the city of Nanking ( now Nanjing ) .
" We have taken note of the remarks by this spokesman that the heinous crimes committed by the Japanese army in Nanking are undeniable facts .
However , it must be pointed out that the case of Shiro Azuma was not a common civilian suit , but an attempt by a tiny minority of Japanese right-wing forces to deny the " Nanking Massacre " under the pretext of judicial procedures , " Zhu said .
" We urge the Japanese side to face up to history and examine itself , and to adhere to the path of peaceful development by drawing lessons from history , " he stated .
