Bonn Praises China 's Role in Asian Financial Crisis
BONN , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- German Deputy Foreign Ministry Werner Hoyer Thursday praised China 's responsibility in keeping a constant exchange rate of the Renminbi ( RMB ) and pegging Hong Kong 's dollar to the U.S. dollar .
Hoyer said after a visit to China last week that during the Asian financial crisis , " China 's role as political and economic stability anchor in Asia has never been so evident " .
He also expressed confidence that Beijing would be able to withstand the crisis this year , adding that if the RMB failed to hold its value , it would exert a massive " shock effect " in the Asian markets , affecting all western countries .
Hoyer started his China visit on February 16 in Hong Kong with a meeting with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa , who is also due to pay a visit to Germany early next month .
In Beijing , Hoyer also held talks with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan , and the Vice-Governor of China 's Central Bank , Chen Yuan , on February 18 - 19 .
