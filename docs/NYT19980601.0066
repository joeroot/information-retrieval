ATLANTA _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on Microsoft 's original schedule of June 25 .
My guess is that the publicity about the company 's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping sales .
After all , most home users will figure a program that attracts so many headlines must be danged important .
So my job today is to be a real TechnoBuddy and urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first month or so .
This has nothing at all to do with the merits of Windows 98 .
Sooner or later , you 'll upgrade .
But there are compelling reasons to wait out the initial rush to install the newest version of Windows .
First , you can expect the technical support telephone lines at both Microsoft and even at retailers will be jammed with calls for help during the first few weeks Windows 98 is available .
Installing a new operating system is like dumping two jigsaw puzzles into one box and then trying to separate them .
There are literally thousands of chances for conflicts with installed programs and hardware devices .
You can bet lots of folks will be on the phone in the days after Windows 98 is available trying to put the pieces of the puzzle back together .
If you wait a month or so , the initial rush should calm down and you 'll have a better chance of getting help by telephone .
Remember that _ worst case _ you can put your computer out of commission when you install any new operating system .
So unless you 're prepared to get sore ears while you 're on hold waiting for help , then don n't join the initial rush .
Second , while all companies _ including Microsoft _ do the best they can to test new software for bugs , there will be some unpleasant surprises when undiscovered flaws are discovered .
All new programs have enough bugs to populate a good-sized rotten log .
The beta testing program catches some of them , but when Windows 98 gets on the market , many more will be discovered .
Let your friends and neighbors find them , let Microsoft correct them , and then buy Windows 98 .
Now , let me make a safe assumption .
Plenty of you are going to ignore this advice .
Heck , if the tables were turned , I might do that , too .
Some of us can n't help getting caught up in the excitement of trying something new that we 've heard a lot about .
So let 's talk about some of the ways to protect yourself if you do install Windows 98 in the first mad rush .
The most important safeguard is to make a complete backup of your hard disk .
That way _ worst case _ you 'll be able to put your computer back the way it was before the installation .
Windows 98 has an uninstall option that , in theory , will do the same thing .
But be safe and make a backup yourself .
Also , follow the on-screen advice you 'll get while you 're installing Windows 98 and take the options to make a recovery disk as well as asking your computer to make a backup copy of your old system files .
Both of these steps can help you undo any problems caused by the installation .
OK .
Follow my advice to wait a while if you can .
And if you insist on walking the high-tech tightrope , at least use a safety net .
