WASHINGTON -- Several Republicans of the U.S. Senate say censure should be considered only after a speedy impeachment trial , and perhaps only after a vote on whether to remove President Bill Clinton from office .
" We ought to vote on these articles of impeachment , and then that is the appropriate time to consider a censure , " Senator Mitch McConnell , a Republican , said on " Fox News Sunday . "
" Assuming neither of those articles pass , which is what 's widely expected will be the outcome ...
you sit down and you negotiate the censure alternative , " he said .
Significant questions remain over whether a deal for ce nsuring the president can be worked out before a trial begins .
There is , however , widespread agreement among Republicans and Democrats that any trial should be quick , given that senators of both parties widely agree that there 's little chance that the chamber will vote to convict and remove Clinton . ( US-Impeachment-SenateUS-Impeachment-Senate )
