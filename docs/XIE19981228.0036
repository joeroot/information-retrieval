Low-Tar Cigarettes May Be Less Safe
OTTAWA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- A new test revealed that low-tar cigarettes may actually cause more heart and lung damages than regular cigarettes , because smokers inhale and smoke more after switching to low-tar brands .
The test , developed by Canada 's British Columbia health researchers , showed that smokers take deeper and more puffs after they switch to the so-called mild cigarettes .
As a result , they are not doing themselves any health favors by changing to low-tar brands .
Canadian Health officials said the new test showed tobacco companies have tricked smokers into thinking a switch would reduce the risks to their health .
They add this underscores the need for clearer warnings on cigarette packaging , and urge tobacco companies to publicize the latest research result on low-tar cigarettes as well as the cigarette ingredients .
