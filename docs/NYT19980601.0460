BUSH BELIEVES ATTORNEY SHOULD TELL HIS STORY IN GROWING TOBACCO DISPUTE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By CLAY ROBISON c.1998 Houston Chronicle
AUSTIN , Texas _ If Houston attorney Joe Jamail has information that Attorney General Dan Morales improperly solicited millions of dollars in the tobacco case , he should be allowed to tell his story under oath , a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush said Monday .
Karen Hughes , the governor 's communications director , said Bush isn n't involved in the effort to question Jamail .
That dispute pits Morales against seven legislators and their attorneys .
But she added : `` Joe Jamail has made it clear he wants to be deposed ...
If that 's the case , we see no harm in letting the facts come out . ''
In separate court challenges , the governor and the seven lawmakers are trying to block $ 2.3 billion in legal fees awarded to five other private attorneys who helped Morales obtain the $ 15.3 billion tobacco settlement .
They believe the fees are excessive .
According to a document the legislators filed in federal court last week , Morales solicited $ 1 million from each of several lawyers he considered hiring for the tobacco lawsuit .
The money was `` purportedly for the purpose of defending General Morales against possible attacks from the tobacco companies , '' the document said .
It didn n't specify what types of attacks .
The allegation , which Morales denies , was based on information provided by Jamail , who was interviewed by Morales for the tobacco case but was not hired .
The document was filed with U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana to support the legislators ' efforts to question Jamail about his discussions with Morales .
Morales is trying to block Jamail 's deposition , but Folsom hasn n't ruled on the dispute .
Jamail , best known for representing Pennzoil in a 1987 case that produced a $ 3 billion settlement and forced Texaco into bankruptcy , has declined to publicly discuss his meetings with the attorney general .
`` I 'm willing to tell what I know under oath .
Perhaps Mr. Morales ought to get under oath and tell what he knows , '' he said last week .
Walter Umphrey of Beaumont , one of the lawyers hired by Morales when the tobacco lawsuit was filed in 1996 , attended one meeting in which money for Morales was discussed , the court document said .
Umphrey has declined to comment , but a spokesman for him and the other outside lawyers , said the claim is `` wholly unfounded . ''
Morales spokesman Ward Tisdale said the attorney general opposes the effort to question Jamail because the legislators aren n't parties to the tobacco lawsuit .
Tisdale said the only money Morales asked the lawyers to provide was for lawsuit expenses .
Each of the five lawyers hired for the suit agreed to risk $ 2 million of their own money in return for a 15 percent contingency agreement .
When the lawsuit was settled in January , the five lawyers estimated they actually spent $ 40 million during their two years working on the case .
Cigarette companies have reimbursed them for that amount .
Neither Morales nor the outside lawyers have publicly accounted for how most of the $ 40 million was spent , despite a formal demand submitted by Bush to the attorney general 's office three months ago .
Tisdale said Morales didn n't require the lawyers to detail most of their expenses because they were working under a contingency agreement .
The only expense reports Morales said he received from the outside lawyers totaled $ 1.7 million for 1996 , the year the lawsuit was filed .
The attorney general quit requiring regular expense reports after that .
Also Monday , Morales filed court documents showing that the private attorneys were at one point willing to consider a `` substantial '' reduction in their fees .
Sources close to the case have said the attorneys recently agreed to take $ 800 million to $ 1.5 billion in fees .
The reduction was to be mediated by two U.S. 5th Circuit Appeals Court judges , but the governor `` refused to participate in the mediation , '' Morales wrote in a letter filed with the court .
Hughes , the governor 's spokeswoman , has said there was never a serious offer to mediate and no guarantee that part of the fees wouldn n't come out of the state 's share of the settlement .
