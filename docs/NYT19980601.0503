AUTO MAKERS PLAN SAFETY REDESIGN

WINDSOR , Ontario _ The mismatch in collisions between cars and light trucks is causing as many as 2,000 extra deaths a year on U.S. roads , but the nation 's automakers have quietly notified regulators that they will redesign their vehicles to improve safety , the United States ' top traffic safety regulator said Monday .
The official , Dr. Ricardo Martinez , administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , said the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles , minivans and pickup trucks , all of which are classified by the government as light trucks , was adding to the death toll .
But Detroit 's Big Three , and many foreign automakers as well , have told regulators in recent months that they plan design changes in cars and light trucks alike to address the problem , Martinez said .
While sport utility vehicles in particular remain a small percentage of the vehicles on the road , sales are growing so quickly that steps must be taken now to prevent serious safety problems in the future , Martinez said .
Although some auto executives have publicly questioned whether a problem exists , he said , the industry had begun working quickly to create better designs .
`` Some are minor modifications , some are larger modifications that will take place down the road , '' Martinez said , refusing to provide details .
He added that the design changes were aimed at improving safety , rather than addressing shifting tastes among vehicle buyers as some auto executives have indicated .
Martinez also disagreed with recent assertions by some auto industry lobbyists that government crash tests had found little evidence of a safety problem that light trucks inflict on cars .
But he declined to elaborate , saying test data would be released on Tuesday .
Martinez spoke at the opening of the International Technical Conference on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles , a gathering every two years of the world 's top safety regulators and researchers .
The Canadian government is acting as host for this year 's conference , in this factory town across the Detroit River from Detroit .
Auto industry officials at the conference declined to discuss what they would do to improve safety .
But managers for General Motors and Ford have said in recent interviews that they will redesign the suspensions on their sport utility vehicles so that these trucks ride closer down to the wheels , reducing the likelihood that in collisions they will override the bumpers and other safety systems of cars .
Martinez offered no details on his calculation that the car-truck mismatch was costing 2,000 lives a year .
But his aides said later that the safety agency had arrived at the number by calculating the number of deaths that would be avoided if all light trucks now on the road were replaced with cars .
