A 'S BLOW ANOTHER ONE IN K.C .
BY STEVE KETTMANN

KANSAS CITY , MO .
_ One of the sarcastic young ciphers on `` SportsCenter '' cracked the other night : `` Convicted felons should be forced to watch the Royals and the A 's . ''
Which raises the obvious question : Did someone send ESPN an advance tape of the Royals ' 10 - 4 win over the A 's Sunday at Kauffman Stadium ?
The A 's bullpen fell apart again , this time taking the brunt of an eight-hit , seven-run outburst in the seventh inning that turned a perfectly tidy game into something more like a toxic waste dump .
Since last Sunday , the A 's bullpen has a hideous 7.80 ERA and that doesn n't begin to convey the horror .
`` I don n't think anybody is getting down , '' left-hander Buddy Groom insisted .
`` We showed earlier in the month we can put some scoreless innings together .
So I don n't think there 's any reason to panic . ''
Sure thing , Buddy .
There were a lot of culprits , but T.J .
Mathews ( 3 - 4 ) was the man who earned the loss .
And boy did he ever earn it .
All with just four pitches .
Starter Kenny Rogers never looked quite in sync and gave up a single and a run-scoring double to start the seventh , trimming the A 's lead to 4 - 3.
Mathews came on in relief and just needed to throw a pitch over the plate so No. 9 hitter Shane Halter could bunt .
This Mathews failed to do .
He missed four times in a row , and faster than you can say `` Light a match , '' Halter was down at first and Mathews was out of the game .
`` I 've got to throw a strike right there , '' Mathews said .
`` Everybody knows it .
He 's bunting .
.
.
.
I think it had been seven or eight days since I threw in a game .
It 's tough in that situation . ''
That pretty much set the tone .
Champion teams like to talk about how good teams make their own good luck .
Less often discussed is the way bad teams make their own bad luck .
If it 's not a question of offending the baseball gods , it 's something awfully close .
The horrible inning would have been merely bad if Johnny Damon had not gotten in the way of Ryan Christenson 's throw from center as he was sliding into third base , trying to advance on Jose Offerman 's single up the middle .
That play , charged as Christenson 's first major-league error , cost the A 's a run and enabled Damon to score to make it 5 - 4 Royals .
They never looked back .
`` They got a break when the kid kicked the ball away , '' A 's manager Art Howe said .
`` The inning snowballed from there . ''
The tragedy was , up until the seventh the game looked like a blueprint for a new and different A 's team that would not have to make any apologies .
Shortstop Miguel Tejada has played just two games for the A 's since being called up from Double-A Huntsville and already it seems hard to imagine anyone else being out there .
Tejada , sleek and edgy , started a double play to end the first inning without Offerman scoring , despite a one-out triple , and Tejada started another double play in the fifth .
Both were plays only a good shortstop makes .
Tejada also reached out and poked a high Tim Belcher pitch to right for a ground-rule double that scored two runs and put the A 's up 4 - 1 in the fifth .
`` That was helmet-high , '' A 's designated hitter Matt Stairs said of the pitch to Tejada .
`` It was chest high , '' Tejada insisted .
`` I saw it like it was right there . ''
Christenson also made a great play in center to snag Mike Sweeney 's drive to the wall in the fourth inning , saving at least two runs .
That 's just how Christenson plays , all-out , but having both him and Tejada up the middle gives the A 's a whole different look .
Tejada went 2-for-3 and hit both balls hard .
`` I don n't know how he even hit the pitch he hit for a double , '' Howe chuckled .
`` He turned some nice double plays .
He 's got a lot of energy out there .
He 's off to a great start with us . ''
