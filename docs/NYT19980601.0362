NEW YORK : institutional theater .
Set in John 's converted chicken coop of a studio ( attractively realized by Ralph Funicello ) at his home in northwestern Connecticut , the play chronicles the tail end of a Labor Day weekend for which John 's children and grandchildren have gathered .
Dennis breaks into this pastoral scene in a jangle of big-city urgency , announcing that the Shuberts and the Seattle Repertory Theater are both interested in John 's new script .
The only problem is the play 's ending .
The conclusion of the play-within-the-play finds its John-like hero retreating to the bosom of his beloved family .
Dennis wants John 's character to break out into the larger world , preferably in the name of engagement with an idealistic cause .
This allows Gurney to joust gently with some of the bugaboos of political correctness explored by Jonathan Reynolds in `` Stonewall Jackson 's House . ''
John winces ( quite rightly ) at the idea of `` closure , '' and in response to Dennis ' proposed alternative ending , which could involve either Rwanda or the Pacific Rim , he answers testily , `` And I 'll top it all off with a profoundly moving speech about the Holocaust . ''
In the meantime , the wry but affectionate Ellen is worried that John will humiliate their children by portraying them onstage , even as she expresses the wish that John would be more honest in depicting her relationship with him .
Ralph , a connoisseur of action films , questions the very raison d ' etre of his father 's talky brand of theater .
There are throughout such Pirandelloesque lines as : `` You and me , standing around , setting the scene .
It 's like the beginning of one of his plays . ''
Yet for all its pre-emptive self-awareness , `` Labor Day '' keeps popping in elements that might have come from a generic Gurney play kit , most notably a romantic entanglement that triggers the denouement and is reminiscent of Lady Chatterly-like situations discussed in both his early `` Children '' and `` The Cocktail Hour . ''
And John 's big speech about civilized values feels like a rote retread of similar declarations from previous plays .
Both John and Gurney , being open-minded , polite fellows , give full weight to all sides of the arguments in the play .
Even as `` Labor Day '' makes fun of Dennis ' theatrical trendiness , it acknowledges that such trends do reflect real changes in society and even close to home .
John , it makes clear , is not without his delusions .
It also suggests that his latest work does indeed oversimplify its characters .
So does `` Labor Day . ''
O ' Brien 's direction is nimble enough , as are the performances , although Sommer 's ticking time bomb interpretation gives the play a slightly sinister quality it can n't support .
It 's always a pleasure to see Ms. Cox and Ms. Van Patten ; and Colby and Ashmanskas don n't overplay their characters ' opposite versions of masculinity .
But there 's never any convincing emotional urgency to these people or the sense , finally , that much is at stake for them .
`` This man is dangerous ; he can hurt , '' says Ellen of her husband .
Well , not on the evidence of `` Labor Day . ''
Still , for the Manhattan Theater Club , coming off a week of highly fraught publicity surrounding Terrence McNally 's `` Corpus Christi , '' the relative toothlessness of Gurney 's latest work may be a comfort .
