NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn woman accused of helping her boyfriend kill a police officer who had gone to their apartment to arrest him last week was indicted Monday on charges including second-degree murder , robbery and assaulting a police officer .
The woman , Betsy Ramos , 33 , first hid her boyfriend , Jose Serrano , from the two officers as they sought to arrest him in their basement apartment in East Flatbush last Tuesday morning , police said .
The indictment charges that when the officers found Serrano , who was being sought for missing a court date on an old drug charge , he and Ms. Ramos both attacked one of the officers , Miriam Sanchez Torres , 36 , and grabbed her service revolver .
Using Torres ' gun , Serrano fatally shot Officer Anthony Mosomillo , 36 , police said .
Mosomillo returned fire , killing Serrano , police said .
`` Police Officer Anthony Mosomillo sacrificed his life in the heroic and courageous performance of his duty , '' the Brooklyn district attorney , Charles Hynes , said in announcing the indictment .
`` These charges , which accuse this defendant of depraved and murderous conduct , will be prosecuted swiftly and fairly to insure that justice is done in his memory . ''
The nine-count indictment charges Ms. Ramos with robbery ( helping take Torres ' gun ) , second-degree murder , assaulting a police officer , weapons possession , obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest .
It was Ms. Ramos who let Mosomillo and Torres into the apartment at 523 E. 34th St. , where Serrano , 29 , was hiding under the floorboards of the bedroom closet , police said .
`` She lied , and told them he wasn n't present , '' said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The officers left the apartment but a neighbor suggested that they look under the floor , and they returned , the official said .
Torres , who is expected to be the chief witness in the case against Ms. Ramos , gave a statement to police in which she said that soon after they returned to the apartment , Serrano emerged from his hiding place fighting and that Ms. Ramos soon joined the struggle .
Torres told investigators that the two knocked her to the ground and that Serrano got her gun .
At that point , Torres told investigators , she turned to her partner and shouted : `` He 's got the gun !
Shoot him ! ''
Ms. Ramos ' lawyer , Andrew Friedman , said that his client was a battered woman who had once sought an order of protection against Serrano .
`` She absolutely denies ever going for the gun or getting into a physical altercation with either police officer , '' he said .
`` She was just there . ''
At the time of her arrest , Ms. Ramos was on federal probation until 2005 after pleading guilty to smuggling heroin into the United States from Jamaica .
