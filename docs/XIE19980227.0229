Moscow to Boost Itself as Tourism Venue
MOSCOW , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The municipality of Moscow is determined to turn the Russian capital city into an international tourism center with an annual reception capacity of 40 million people by the year 2010 .
An announcement by the municipality on Wednesday said Moscow received two million tourists in 1997 , four times that of 1996 .
However , the attraction of Moscow is still less than that of St. Petersburg which received 2.5 million tourists , of whom 1.9 million were foreign tourists .
The municipality said Russia 's underdeveloped tourism , with a share of less than 1 percent in the international tourism market , did not match the country 's vast territory and rich and varied tourism resources .
Apart from the extremely poor infrastructure for tourism and service trade , there was the problem of high charges and poor services in the present industry , the municipality said .
