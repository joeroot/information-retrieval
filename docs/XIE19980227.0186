Australian Wool Prices Ease Marginally This Week
CANBERRA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Wool prices in Australia 's different markets eased marginally at this week 's sales , market news releases said Friday .
The eastern market indicator fell two cents to close at 638 Australian cents a clean kilogram ( kg ) while the western market indicator finished at 589 cents per kg , down three cents .
The Australian Wool Exchange 's national indicator remained unchanged at 659 cents .
A total of 86,471 bales were offered at sales in Newcastle , Melbourne and Fremantle , the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said in its weekly wool report .
The pass-in rate was 16.8 percent .
" The buying trade felt that the market held up reasonably well with the quantity on offer under current market circumstances , even allowing for the high pass-in rate in Fremantle , " the council said .
" The easing of tensions on the waterfront and a relatively stable currency have helped to stabilize prices for the time being . "
The strongest demand came from Europe and Japan , with support from China and India .
Competition from the United States added to demand for better quality wool .
Sales continue next week in Adelaide and Sydney where about 63,000 bales will be offered .
