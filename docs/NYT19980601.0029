MASSCAP SEEMS TO BE ON TRACK
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By MICHAEL MADDEN c.1998 The Boston Globe
& UR ; & LR ; BOSTON _ When Puerto Madero took to the track for the Massachusetts Handicap Saturday , John Murphy had the same thought as did many of the 17,754 fans at Suffolk Downs .
Fan after fan thought what Murphy said .
`` What a beautiful-looking horse , '' said Murphy , the owner of Formal Gold who lost to Skip Away by a neck in the stirring 1997 MassCap .
`` You won n't find many who look better than he does . ''
And jockey Kent Desormeaux aboard Puerto Madero thought his horse was running as beautifully as he looked as Desormeaux made his move to catch Skip Away on the far turn .
`` I thought I really had him , '' said the hottest jockey in the United States .
`` I made up 4 lengths on him and I thought I was getting to him . ''
But then Skip Away `` hit that next gear , '' as the jockey put it , and Desormeaux learned as so many others have learned , that Skip Away is more , much more , than he looks .
Skip Away jogged away from Desormeaux and Puerto Madero in the stretch drive , leaving the jockey to say , `` I guess we 'll have to get him the next time . ''
Fat chance , for Puerto Madero had an edge on Skip Away Saturday that he never will have again _ Skip Away carried an extra 14 pounds _ and Skip Away will go on , a horse who never looks as good as he is .
Skip Away 's trainer , Sonny Hine , was asked just how good that is as his prized horse joined three of the all-time greats _ Whirlaway , Seabiscuit , and Cigar _ as a two-time winner of the MassCap .
`` It 's hard to say , '' said Hine , who then recounted a recent discussion with a friend .
The friend is an avid devotee of Len Ragozin 's `` Sheets , '' a complicated measure of how fast a horse runs that is arcane but has devotees who swear on a stack of mutuel tickets that the `` Sheets '' are one of the most accurate measures of a horse 's ability .
The `` Sheets '' assign a numerical rating to a horse 's performance in a race , with higher numbers being poor and low numbers , such as a 5 or a 7 , considered very good .
`` I can n't even read the Sheets , '' said Hine , `` but I was told that Skip Away has so many 1s on his Sheets and they tell me that 1s are about as fast as you can go .
And ( Hine 's friend ) told me that not since Dr. Fager has a horse had so many 1s on his Sheets as Skip Away . ''
Dr. Fager , of course , was a giant of American racing from 30 years ago and is considered one of the fastest American horses _ if not the fastest _ in the last half-century .
Dr. Fager also amassed a ton of fame , glory , and legendary tales , while Skip Away has received little of that and is regarded by some as just another very good horse .
Much the same could be said about Saturday 's MassCap itself , a race that has become much better than it is regarded across the country .
For the fourth straight year , the MassCap was won by the best horse in America , Cigar twice and now Skip Away twice .
But the future of the race hinges on decisions made by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association , a new group designed to unite and promote the industry .
Lou Raffetto , the executive vice president for racing at Suffolk Downs , has been fearful that Suffolk might be pushed aside if a larger track such as Churchill Downs schedules a lucrative race for older horses in late May or June .
Churchill already has increased the purse of the June 13 Stephen Foster , a heretofore nondescript race , from $ 150,000 to $ 800,000 to lure Silver Charm , the only top handicap horse in America other than Skip Away .
But Tim Smith , the head of the NTRA , was in Boston Saturday , immediately went to Raffeto 's office at Suffolk Downs , and assured Raffetto that the MassCap and Suffolk `` will be guaranteed '' a spot in the series of races for older horses that the NTRA will put together for next year .
`` I 've seen 10 different schedules for races that have been put together , '' Smith said later , `` and in all 10 of them , Suffolk Downs is included .
The important thing is we want to cover all the markets for racing and , to us , Boston and New England is one of the important markets . ''
Indeed , said Smith , the NTRA will not become a play toy for the largest race tracks in the country to the detriment of the midsized tracks such as Suffolk Downs .
`` This is a great market for racing , '' Smith said of Boston and New England .
`` It would be silly for us to overlook this market .
The MassCap is in all our plans . ''
Raffetto said he was pleased with his conversation with Smith , even though the NTRA head said it is too early to say how the schedule will be played out next year and whether the MassCap might have to move to another date .
`` We 're flexible , '' said Raffetto , `` and we 'd listen to all suggestions ; the important thing is the MassCap be guaranteed its place . ''
Meanwhile , Hine 's fiery words about Bob Baffert , the trainer of Silver Charm , have ignited a blaze that will smolder until the Breeders Cup in November .
Hine called Baffert `` a coward '' for choosing not to run against Skip Away and it is unclear if the two will meet before the Breeders Cup .
Hine will bring Skip Away into Baffert 's backyard at Hollywood Park for the Hollywood Gold Cup later this month and will remain in Baffert 's California bastion for the Del Mar Classic in August at Del Mar.
If Baffert keeps Silver Charm away from Skip Away even though Skip Away has traveled to California for two big races , then those words first uttered in Boston by Hine ( `` A coward never wins '' ) will grow hotter and hotter .
