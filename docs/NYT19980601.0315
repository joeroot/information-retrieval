SONOMA , Calif. _ Everything changed after Latrell Sprewell strangled the coach .
Golden State Warriors General Manager Garry St. Jean had agreed to go wine tasting with me .
I would copy down his comments and write an article about the jock whose taste in beverages extends beyond Gatorade and Bud Lite .
Because that 's the truth _ Garry St. Jean knows from wine .
But there was that unfortunate incident involving Sprewell 's fingers around the throat of P.J .
Carlesimo , which was followed by a hasty call from St. Jean .
His tone was apologetic .
It wouldn n't look good , he explained , if a photo showed up in print with the general manager grinning broadly and sipping chardonnay while the team was in crisis .
I could see his point , although my mind immediately raced ahead to the caption under the photo : `` Latrell Sprewell may have strangled coach P.J .
Carlesimo , but Garry St. Jean doesn n't choke on merlot . ''
We put our outing on hold , let the wine age a little longer .
And about a minute after the Warriors season ended , St. Jean was on the phone .
`` When are we going wine tasting ? ''
he wanted to know .
So , about a week ago , we went .
There was St. Jean , his wife Mary Jane ( known as M.J . ) and me .
I had selected three wineries , Ravenswood , Arrowood and Chateau St. Jean , all fine Sonoma County producers .
And if you 've noticed that St. Jean the coach and St. Jean the winery have the same name , you 've discovered the key to this article .
Here 's the background .
In his pre-wine days , St. Jean worked as an assistant coach for Don Nelson on the Milwaukee Bucks .
That was in 1980 .
Nelson ( usually called Nellie ) ain n't exactly your typical wine sophisticate .
He and St. Jean would chug beer and feel they had achieved the height of culture .
`` I guess we were what you 'd call relative rookies , '' St. Jean told me .
Later on , when Nelson became head coach of the Warriors , he hired St. Jean as an assistant .
Dan Gustafson and Mike Kenton of Chateau St. Jean noticed .
They were wine guys , but they were also Warriors season-ticket holders , and they thought , hey , wouldn n't it be a blast to meet the coaches and do a little wine promoting at the same time .
So Gustafson and Kenton , who 've since moved to Codorniu Napa , sent St. Jean some wine and invited him and M.J .
to the winery , and pretty soon they all became friends .
As time went on , and St. Jean the coach continued to drink St. Jean the wine , he noticed the stuff actually tasted good .
Before long , he was devoted .
When people asked , `` Is Chateau St. Jean your winery ? ''
he replied , `` Sure .
Drop by the property . ''
He and M.J .
own a house on Cape Cod .
Over the front door is a sign : `` Chateau St. Jean . ''
All of which explains why we found ourselves in a stretch limo headed north toward Sonoma on a sunny Friday morning .
We were greeted at Ravenswood by David Riffo , head of hospitality , who explained Ravenswood makes big bucks from its California chardonnay , known as Chateau Cache Fl ' eau .
We didn n't spend time in the tasting room .
Instead , Riffo took us to a barrel room where he dipped into a barrel with a long plastic tube that looked like a turkey baster .
In fact , it 's called a `` thief , '' and it scooped up 1997 Barricia Vineyard Chardonnay from an old cask and then from a new cask .
The wine from the old cask had hints of green apples and pears , all the usual stuff wine writers write about .
You feel like a dope if you don n't taste them , too .
The wine from the new barrel was smoky .
Riffo said the two wines would be blended together .
The chardonnay was really terrific , especially when you consider that Ravenswood is a red wine house , well-known for zinfandel .
By the way , if you don n't find my wine adjectives specific enough , remember I 'm just a dumb sporstwriter .
St. Jean has better adjectives .
Riffo was talking about malolactic fermentation .
Pretty soon , he 'd have gotten down to the molecular level _ that 's how enthusiastic he was about the process .
`` Malolactic fermentation , '' St. Jean said , impressed .
`` Holy Moly ! ''
