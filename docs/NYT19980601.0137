& UR ; By MARTIN CARNOY AND DAVID CARNOY & LR ; & QC ; & UR ; ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & LR ; & QC ; & UR ; ( From `` Fathers of a Certain Age '' ) & LR ; & QC ;
It is Saturday morning , 6 : 30 a.m. , and a faint light is beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed .
Suddenly , they hear the creaking of a door hinge .
One of the figures in the bed stirs , turning over onto his back .
This is Adam , who , somewhere in his confused semi-consciousness , feels a weight on his body and then his head .
`` Daddy , '' a tiny voice says next to his ear , `` it 's time to get up .
It 's light out . ''
Adam groans , his eyes still closed .
`` Go back to sleep , honey , '' he manages to say .
`` It 's nighttime . ''
Then , still without moving , not addressing anyone in particular : `` Can n't you do something about this ?
I 'm 54 years old and there 's a child sitting on my head at 6 : 30 in the morning . ''
Adam says that on mornings like these , he feels as if he 's living in a lost episode of `` The Twilight Zone . ''
He is a member of a fast-growing group of men who are fathering in their late 40s , 50s and even 60s .
At a time when they should be basking in the midafternoon sun of lives well lived , these men are raising young children .
`` There are mornings when I 'll wake up _ I most likely , get awakened , '' says Adam , `` and I 'll say to myself , where the hell am I?
And who 's this insane person in my body who 's doing this ?
And then I realize , it 's me .
I 'm the insane person . ''
By the time he 's had his morning coffee , that attitude has begun to improve .
And by midafternoon _ the time he usually takes his son to the park _ he feels quite good about himself and the decision he 's made .
`` It 's funny , but I don n't see myself as any older than those guys over there , '' he tells us , pointing to a couple of men in their early 30s playing with their children nearby .
`` Sure , at some level I know I look like Alex 's grandfather , and sometimes I catch strange looks , but in my mind 's eye , I 'm no different than they are _ just another father in the park . ''
Adam is typical of these fathers `` of a certain age . ''
They have always been around , but now there seem to be a lot more of them .
They are the grayheads standing in line at the supermarket or the folks you mistake for grandparents at the local nursery school .
The rapid increase of middle-aged fathers and the growing _ and , many would say , inappropriate _ interest in fathering relatively late in a man 's life are mainly the result of delayed childbearing by many professional women and the rise in the divorce rate .
And technology has made it much more possible today for older women _ and their older husbands _ to have children even if the wife is not significantly younger than the husband .
It all sounds like fun _ older men finding new meaning in life and women attaining professional success first and then having families , too .
But not everyone agrees that it is such a good thing .
Those who object see older parents as acting selfishly , against the interest of the children they choose to parent .
They do not find the grayheads with preschoolers cute .
For many Americans , middle-aged parents are just one more symbol of the decay of traditional values and the growing selfishness that puts misplaced self-satisfaction ahead of the greater social good .
& UR ; THE GREAT MORAL DEBATE & LR ; & QL ;
`` My daughter is an everyday miracle , '' a friend in his 50s tells us , smiling .
Steve has three grown children , all boys , from his first marriage , and a girl , age 2 , from his second .
`` You don n't take the incredible gift of a child for granted when you are in late middle age , '' Steve goes on .
`` The unfolding of life has to be savored _ observed carefully , contemplated and understood _ when your own mortality confronts you daily in the unforgiving reality of the early morning mirror .
My attachment to my daughter also has an immediacy and unconditionality that seems more like what mothers are supposed to feel .
I have discovered real parenting skills , the ones I was too busy to work on when I was climbing the so-called ladder of economic and social success . ''
Steve and others who are fathering second families tend to talk a lot about the difference in feelings and commitment they have this second time around .
Fathers in their late 40s , 50s and beyond tend to value children as much as their work , and often more .
They seem to spend more time with their children than younger fathers .
Some have retired from the working world completely and take on roles as stay-at-home parents while their younger wives go to full-time jobs .
But with all the intensity of later fatherhood , the new role is not easy .
The self-indulgence of late middle age bumps against the energies of a new life demanding attention .
Even if an older father may not be as concerned with competing at work , and much more concerned with discovering his emotions , he often wants to focus on himself , his wife , his children from an earlier marriage or his grandchildren _ all of which can be tough competition against the needs of his still-young child .
One older father , Larry , was talking to the wife of an old friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents .
The woman was obviously disturbed by the notion that Larry and other men her husband 's age are fathering young children .
`` Imagine Alan ( her son ) today , at 27 , '' she said , quite agitated , `` if he had been born to a father in his 50s .
Suppose his father had even lived that long , he would be 80 .
Could a man 80 years old provide the emotional support that a typical kid like Alan still needs in his 20s ?
Could that same father at 70 have had any meaningful connection with a teenager ? ''
`` I doubt it , '' she said .
`` More likely , Alan would now have to be taking care of an old man with serious health problems .
I don n't think kids in their 20s are ready to do that .
They should not have to do it .
They should be free to think about themselves .
God knows , the ego trip ends soon enough , why make them take on the worry of aging parents when they should be exploring life ?
`` You don n't know what it is to lose a parent when you are young , '' she continued , getting angrier .
`` I lost my mother when I was 21 , and I never got over it .
It is devastating and unfair .
Sure , it happens even when you are born to young parents like I was .
But fathers who start in their 50s stand a good chance of dying before their kids are 20 .
You may not like that idea , but it is true .
It leaves a tremendous void . ''
Larry says the conversation shook him to the core .
`` Was I irresponsible in having a child so late in life ? ''
he worries .
`` Do children who have older parents and lose them prematurely suffer a harm that makes the whole enterprise pure self-gratification ?
I realized that in the decision around this child , neither my wife or I had given much thought to whether I would be alive at 75 or what I would be like in my 60s as our then teenager confronted puberty and high school .
Our main concerns had been around our own lifestyle and how it would have to change . ''
But as he thought about it further , Larry realized that having a father at age 50 or even 35 as a normal turn of events is a recent phenomenon .
His own father was 33 when Larry 's grandfather died a `` normal '' death at 62 , and this grandfather was 34 when his father died in 1912 .
Today , if a man reaches 50 , he will , on average , live past 80 .
True , there is still a good chance that , if he is an older father , his child will lose him in his or her 20s , at a time when many children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their fathers .
But there is an even better chance that the father will be there for the child 's wedding and the grandchildren .
Larry also contemplated the quality of the relationship with his young child .
Older parents know that they risk making their children face a father 's `` early '' death .
Yet they also know that they can give their child a higher material standard of living , more father time , perhaps a higher quality of the father 's time and probably a more stable marital relationship during the years the father is present .
When we ask Larry about this conundrum , he is still not sure what the right answer is .
But he does feel that he has probably spent a lot more time thinking about parenting than younger parents do _ certainly more than when he had fathered his first child at the age of 27 .
For now , Larry seems to have settled , at least in his own mind , that he is doing the right thing .
