Starr Defends His Investigation of Clinton
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr , opening a statement to the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee , defended his investigation of President Bill Clinton and alleged a pattern of abuse of power by the president .
" This office has achieved a superb record in courts of law ...
We go to court and not on the talk-show circuit , and our record shows that there is a bright line between law and politics , " Starr said in his testimony released Wednesday and prepared for delivery Thursday .
He alleged Clinton abused his power in the Monica Lewinsky case in 10 different ways .
" In short , the evidence suggests that the president repeatedly used the machinery of government and the powers of his office to conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the American people , from the judicial process in the ( Paula ) Jones case and from the grand jury , " he said in the testimony .
Starr , who is the first witness in the committee 's impeachment inquiry , said his office considered making an impeachment referral to Congress in late 1997 on the Whitewater real estate deal and even drafted a report , but stopped short " because of the difficulty of establishing the truth with a sufficient degree of confidence . "
" The pattern of obstruction of justice , false statements and misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky investigation did not occur in a vacuum , " he said , adding his office had faced an " extraordinary " number of legal disputes with Clinton and his supporters that have blocked investigations and thrown up roadblocks .
" We have been forced to go to court time and again to seek information from the executive branch and to fight a multitude of privilege claims asserted by the administration -- every single one of which we have won , " he said .
