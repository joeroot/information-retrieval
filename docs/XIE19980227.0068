She said , " I love both of the festivals , but I prefer the Tibetan Lunar New Year . "
Gaisang Digi , who comes from Lhasa , capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region , is studying in the first grade of the school .

She said , " With the festival approaching , I am homesick .
I miss my parents and the blue sky of my hometown .
`` I have become accustomed to life at the school .
I phoned my parents the day before yesterday to say Happy New Year to them , " she said .
About her future , she said with confidence : " I will devote myself to my studies , and when I graduate from university I will go back to Tibet to help with construction there . "
Principal Piao said , " In the past decade 639 Tibetan students have graduated from the school and studied in universities and professional schools .
