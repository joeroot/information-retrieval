U.S. Top Officials Meet to Respond to Iraq 's Promise
WASHINGTON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Top U.S. Security officials are having an urgent meeting at the White House on Saturday to discuss how to respond to Iraq 's promise to resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors .
Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume without conditions and inspectors would be allowed to return immediately , U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah said Saturday in New York .
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan responded to the promise , saying that Iraq 's decision was " positive " and met all requirements of the U.N. Security Council .
Shah said the Iraqi leadership sent a letter to Annan saying that he will allow the work of inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites .
There are " no conditions ...
in this letter , " Shah said .
The U.S. responded with caution .
" We have not seen the letter .
We 've only seen the reports .
I can n't make a judgment , " White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said .
Earlier in the day before Iraq officially announced the promise , Lockhart demanded " concrete and demonstrable actions " that Saddam Hussein will allow the return of U.N. weapons inspectors .
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen , Presidential National Security Advisor Sandy Berger , Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) Chief George Tenet and State Department officials met in the White House to review the new development .
The U.S. had started a military buildup in the Gulf to prepare for possible military strike against Iraq .
But the Clinton administration has repeatedly said Baghdad can avoid being attacked by unconditional and full compliance .
Meanwhile , the first wave of additional U.S. warplanes left for the Gulf this morning : six B-52 heavy bombers departed Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana , at 4 : 38 a.m. EST .
The aircraft were to be followed shortly by F-15s , F-16s , and other B-1 bombers from bases across the country , Air Force spokeswoman Wendy Frable said .
Iraq decided on October 31 to suspend all cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors .
