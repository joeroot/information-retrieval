World 's Leading Investment Banks Confident in China 's Economy
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's economy , though expected to face increasing external pressure with the global economy full of uncertainties next year , still has the confidence of the world 's leading investment banks .
Goldman Sachs ( China ) L.L.C .
recommends an overweight position in Chinese equities , pointing to the belief that China will reach its target of eight percent in economic growth this year and many favorable factors next year .
" China 's policy makers have demonstrated ability to offset weaker exports by spurring domestic demand through infrastructure investment , and their commitment not to devalue the Chinese currency is credible , " said Ziwang Xu , managing director with the Goldman Sachs .
He also pointed out that the rebound in rural consumption in October could serve as a buffer to overall consumer demand , and subdued inflation also provides more room for interest rate cut in 1999 .
As a major booster of the economy , fixed asset investment in China surged 28 percent year-on-year in October .
Meanwhile , retail sales rose 8.4 percent in rural areas , where 80 percent of the Chinese population live .
Statistics show that China 's economy , after hitting the bottom in the second quarter this year with a growth of 6.8 percent , has started to pick up in the third quarter as a result of the government 's stimulus package , and the growth is expected to speed up in the last three months .
Analysts with the Merrill Lynch are even more upbeat about the China economy .
They said they expect it to become a leader in Asian economies in the coming years .
" Domestic demand is the key to the China economy , and China has enough such demand potential to explore until the year of 2000 , " an analyst with the Merrill Lynch said , adding that " if the housing market in the nation could be nurtured and mature in the coming years , China may replace Japan to become the future driving force of the Asian economy .
