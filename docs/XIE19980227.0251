Mexican Foreign Minister on Anti-Drug War
MEXICO CITY , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- A multilateral monitoring system in the war against drugs could be established within the United Nations during a meeting scheduled for June 8 - 10 in New York , Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said Thursday .
During a current meeting of education ministers taking place in the city of Merida on Mexico 's Yucatan peninsula , Green said the experience of some nations that have partially legalized the use of drugs will be analyzed .
The certification made by the United States every year to combat drug trafficking , which is considered a unilateral measure , will also be re-examined .
Multilateral monitoring , the minister said , would be a different mechanism from the certification of the U.S. government .
Green said that her country does not accept pressure from anybody .
Mexico works with the United States and many other countries , but only on the matter of exchanging information and in training .
No prosecutions or detentions were ever made at the request of other countries , she added .
