ILLNESSES FROM EATING S.F .
BAY AREA OYSTERS IMPERILS LOCAL MARKET
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By ERIC BRAZIL c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
MARSHALL , Calif. _ Tomales Bay oyster farmers who have earned a national reputation for their sweet morsels say that an outbreak of illness traced to oysters from their beds imperils their market niche and perhaps even their survival .
The number of documented cases of illness attributable to eating Tomales Bay oysters early this month has hit 110 , and the mystery lingers : What contaminated the succulent bivalve mollusks in one of the cleanest bodies of water on either coast ?
More than three weeks after the first case was reported , state health officials still don n't know , and until they do , the harvesting of Tomales Bay oysters , which have graced the menus of the West 's finest restaurants , is suspended indefinitely .
`` We 're frankly at the point where we 're looking at survival .
We have to figure out ways of making it work , and I haven n't figured it out yet , '' said Drew Alden , owner of Tomales Bay Oysters , which has been in business since 1909 .
`` This is very frustrating , '' agreed Terry Sawyer , a co-owner of Hog Island Oyster Co. He said he hopes state health investigators find `` a smoking gun .
Our reputation is based on quality , and having people get sick hits us hard .
...
Some people say they can n't wait till we 're back in business , but there are people who aren n't going to want to eat oysters ever again . ''
Local markets and restaurants that relied on Tomales Bay oyster farmers are turning to other sources .
`` We haven n't had a California oyster in more than two weeks , '' said Steve Sancimino of San Francisco 's venerable Swan Oyster Depot .
`` We 're getting them from Puget Sound and British Columbia . ''
Even the Tomales Bay farmers themselves are buying oysters from the Northwest _ to resell to customers so they won n't turn to other suppliers .
`` We 've got to carry on , '' said Hog Island co-owner Mike Watchorn , grimacing as he unloaded bags of oysters trucked in fresh overnight from Washington .
`` These can n't hold a candle to ours , but we have to stay in business for our customers . ''
The suspension catches the oyster farmers at the cusp of the retail season .
`` This is when we get rockin ' and rollin ' , when people start coming to West Marin and barbecuing oysters , '' said Alden .
Oysters feed by filtering whatever floats by and concentrating it .
They filter about a quart of fluid a day , consequently they 're the first indicator of toxins in seawater .
Some kind of contaminant got into the beds of the Hog Island , Point Reyes and Tomales Bay companies in early May and was passed onto diners who ate raw or undercooked oysters .
They complained of diarrhea , cramps , vomiting , low-grade fever and chills .
The companies voluntarily recalled their oysters from restaurants , retail outlets and distributors .
All the oysters were off market shelves by May 15 .
Tomales Bay oysters account for more than 80 percent of the $ 2.5-million-a-year Marin County shellfish industry .
The bay is considered ideal because it 's unusually free of industrial contaminants ; its mouth is so shallow that large , deep draft vessels can n't enter .
And development along the bay is minimal .
The current harvest suspension is the longest in at least 15 years .
Manure runoff from dairy farms in the hills east of the bay is one possible source of contamination .
To lessen that risk , the State Department of Health Services prohibits oyster harvesting for four to five days after any storm that drops one half to two thirds of an inch of rain on the Marin coastal watershed .
But the oysters that sickened people were harvested during a dry period .
`` We harvested during an ` open ' period , and that makes it ( the contamination ) kind of mysterious .
It had nothing to do with a typical rainfall closure , '' said Martin Strain , owner of the Point Reyes Oyster Co.
Ben Werner , chief of the disease investigations section at the state Department of Health Services , said the reported illness could be caused either by a virus or bacteria .
But `` we don n't know the specific etiology of the disease .
...
Very few adequate studies have been done . ''
