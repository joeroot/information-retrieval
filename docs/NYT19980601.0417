ARTE TV EYES ALL OF EUROPE
( js ) By CRAIG R. WHITNEY c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
STRASBOURG , France _ Most Europeans still think of themselves as French , German , Italian , British or whatever first and Europeans second .
Even the weather reports on the nightly television news in any country seldom report what is happening just across the border .
So building a truly European public television station was a mighty challenge for Arte , a Franco-German cultural broadcasting channel based in this European city , when it started up six years ago .
Arte now transmits cultural and public affairs programming in French and German by satellite to 50 million homes from North Africa and Israel to Scandinavia .
The programming is produced by the French , German , Belgian , Swiss , Spanish , Austrian and Polish partners .
Symbolically based in a Rhineland city claimed by both France and Germany over the centuries and last fought over in World War II , the Arte consortium has a budget of $ 280 million , most of it provided from the television tax that France and Germany levy on all set owners .
The original French and German stations that set up Arte produce most of what it uses , but it has its own Spartan production facilities scattered over this Alsatian capital .
The people who run it say they want to do for European cultural television what CNN and Britain 's Sky News have done for commercial news television , but in a distinctively European way .
`` We said from the beginning that although we were a Franco-German enterprise , our future lay in Europe , '' said Hans Robert Eisenhauer , the station 's deputy program director , over a glass of riesling and a plate of Alsatian pike-perch and sauerkraut at a restaurant near the station recently .
`` In the future , we 'd like to be developing more extensive links with British producers at the BBC or Channel Four television , because without English you can n't have a truly European network , '' he said .
You probably can n't do it by broadcasting only in the evening , either , as Arte has had to do because of limits on available broadcast time in Germany .
There , Kinderkanal , a public channel for children , suddenly metamorphoses into grown-up Arte at 7 p.m. In France , as La Sept / Arte , it shares space until then with La Cinquieme , a public channel with which it may eventually merge .
In both countries , it continues until the small hours of the morning .
Satellite and German cable subscribers can zap onto either the French or the German soundtrack as they like , a possibility that French technology does not yet permit .
But Arte is not for everybody .
It had an average market share of 3.3 percent in France last year and only 0.6 percent in Germany , where more channels compete for viewer attention .
Officials of the station here take comfort from surveys showing that 27 million people overall of continental Europe last year watched regularly last year .
Still , with more than 300 million European citizens , there 's obviously a long way to go .
`` In both France and Germany today , there is far more national programming , particularly in movies , than there was 10 years ago , '' said Andreas Schreitmueller , who commissions movies for Arte and is German like Eisenhauer .
When European leaders defend European culture against the influx of Hollywood entertainment , Schreitmueller said , the result is the production of more French , German , Italian , etc. television movies and entertainment programs , not more `` European '' ones .
Arte tries for a more international flavor ; for the end of this year , it has commissioned a series of hourlong films by African , European , Brazilian , Canadian and Taiwanese directors called `` The Collection 2000 Seen by ... ''
What the films have in common , Schreitmueller said , is at least one scene dealing with the final minutes of the 20th century a year hence .
For instance , Don McKellar 's Canadian entry , `` Last Night , '' has the world end promptly with 1999 .
`` What we 're always looking for is a new perspective , a new way of looking at things , '' he said .
`` Internationalism is a big part of that . ''

All the movies that Arte broadcasts have to be prepared with two soundtracks , in French and German , or if in English , with French and German subtitles .
`` We 're also thinking of doing a 10-week family soap series that would take place in the cities that have been designated European cultural capitals , '' Schreitmueller said .
`` One episode might play in Cracow , the next in Bologna , the next in Avignon , in Santiago de Compostela and so on , '' he said .
Arte aspires to be cultural television , and high culture at that , but isn n't afraid to poke fun at itself , particularly with its imaginative logos and promotion spots .
One of them features an actor posing as George Harrison in Liverpool or Herbert von Karajan in Bayreuth , always of course making a pitch for Arte programs , under the slogan `` Arte looks at Europe , and Europe watches Arte . ''
`` We have a serious image , and we want that , but we don n't want to scare off people by making them think we 're elitist , '' said Henri L ' Hostis , who leads a team of graphic artists that produces Arte spots .
News consumes 11 percent of the $ 175 million program budget , with a nightly magazine-format program at 7 : 30 weekdays and the main daily news report , with no anchor and voice-over news clips , at 8 : 30 .
On Saturdays , the 7 : 30 p.m. slot is filled by `` Parallel History , '' a series that often takes events of World War II and analyzes how differently movie news programs of the day covered them in countries on opposite sides ( Germany , Britain , Russia and occupied France , for instance ) .
`` We try to look at events in a different way from the national news programs , '' said Georg Schmolz , director of news programming , who now has two correspondents in Bonn and Paris and uses a bicycle to get around to the five different news production sites that Arte has in Strasbourg .
With a slightly bigger budget , he says , the news programs will start at 7 : 50 p.m. and run consecutively for nearly an hour , with in-depth explorations of the main events of the day .
Three times a week , three , four or five consecutive evening programs are devoted to aspects of a single subject .
`` Falsifications : Appearance and Reality '' last January , for instance , started with Helmut Dietl 's 1991 film `` Schtonk , '' a satire based on a Hitler-diaries hoax that fooled the German weekly magazine Stern , among others , in 1983 .
The evening of fakery continued through two documentaries on Konrad Kujau , the counterfeiter who pulled off the diary fraud .
It ended with a game that tested viewers ' own credulity , quizzing them and then giving the answers after a documentary that showed how easy it is to manipulate photographs and videotapes electronically .
