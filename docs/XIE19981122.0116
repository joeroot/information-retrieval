992 NLD Members Resign in Myanmar : Newspaper
YANGON , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- A total of 992 members of Myanmar 's opposition National League for Democracy ( NLD ) from 15 township branches in 8 states and divisions of the country have resigned up to November 18 since September , the New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Sunday .
Meanwhile , 10 branches of the party have been dissolved , the official newspaper said .
The NLD members are said to have resigned out of their own volition , for they had no desire to carry out political activities of the party .
The NLD members and branches are said to have presented their resignation and dissolution requests to their respective township offices of the Multi-Party Democracy Election Commission formed to supervise the general election held in May 1990 .
However , the Yangon-based NLD headquarters charged in a series of statements that the authorities have been cracking down on the party , pressuring its detained members to resign and some township branches to dissolve illegally and forcibly .
The NLD said it " could not accept the dissolution ( of the branches ) at all , " adding that " as a branch of the party , it has no rights to do so without the knowledge of the Central Headquarters . "
It also said that the move goes against the Political Parties Registration Law designed by the authorities concerned .
The resignation of the NLD members and the dissolution of its branches came after a series of government-organized " mass rallies " across the country against the NLD and its leadership , especially Aung San Suu Kyi , the party 's general secretary .
The NLD said the authorities were " illegally " using people from all walks of life who are under " pressure " to express the " people 's desire , " creating further political confusion .
It also stressed that it reserves the rights to organize similar mass rallies to present facts on the current situation in Myanmar as a legal political party .
The NLD won the 1990 general election -- contested by 93 political parties -- with 396 parliamentary seats out of 485 .
