EL NINO MAY RAIN ON THIS PARADE OF CHAMPIONS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By MARK FAINARU-WADA c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
SAN FRANCISCO _ During a particularly wicked rainstorm at last year 's U.S. Open in Bethesda , Md. , shelter was at a premium .
The various hospitality tents were packed , and that concerned Jon Barker .
Barker was at Congressional Country Club on a fact-finding mission .
As the championship coordinator for the 1998 U.S. Open , to be played at the Olympic Club in San Francisco , Barker worried aloud about the need for bigger tents in case of rain .
`` They just looked at me and said , ` Don n't worry about that .
Never , ever worry about that in San Francisco .
It never rains in San Francisco in June , '' ' Barker said .
Welcome to never-never land .
The June 18 - 21 tournament is nigh and , strange as it seems , Barker 's concerns don n't seem so far-fetched anymore .
`` This is just amazing to all of us , '' Barker said Thursday as El Nino dropped another day of rain on the Bay area .
Though rain fell on the past three U.S. Opens , San Francisco was supposed to provide a respite .
But now , with the city already hit by near-record rainfall and with an unpredictable June here , officials are bracing themselves .
The wet weather has hampered some construction around the course , though United States Golf Association championship manager Steve Worthy said rain was more an `` annoyance '' than anything else .
As for playing conditions , the rough is the greatest concern .
According to Tim Moraghan , the USGA 's agronomist for championships , continued rains can make the rough difficult to trim , and rough that is too tall has a tendency to lay over .
`` Right now , the grass is growing too fast before we can get out to cut it , '' Course superintendent John Fleming said .
`` And once you mow it , if you don n't mow it when it 's relatively dry , it just clumps up . ''
Fleming said the plan was for the rough to be at 5 inches when the tournament begins , but `` all it takes is a good rain and two to three days of not being able to mow , and you 're up to 7.
It 's hard to get mowers up that high . ''
