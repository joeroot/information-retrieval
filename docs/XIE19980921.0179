King May Lose Boxing License
WASHINGTON , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Don King 's license to promote fights in Florida might be suspended or revoked by the States Athletics Commission .
The commission 's decision may also test its credibility , as its executive director denied allegations that King was given special treatment in return for a 100,000 dollars donation to a boxing foundation .
U.S. Senator John McCain has asked Florida Governor Lawton Chiles to investigate allegations that the commission is caught up in a conflict of interest in its dealings with King .
" The governor 's office has concerns , and we will be taking appropriate action , " Chiles spokeswoman Edie Ousley said .
" We are not taking this issue lightly . "
Michael Scionti , executive director of the commission , was ap pointed by the commission as its top administrator in 1996 .
He is a friend of Chiles and a former amateur boxer .
Scionti created a boxing foundation last year , and announced a major contribution from Don King Productions .
" He floored me when he said 100,000 dollars , " Scionti said .
Scointi denied the allegation that the 100,000 charity donation from King appeared to buy the promoter special treatment .
Judd Burstein has asked the commission to revoke King 's license .
