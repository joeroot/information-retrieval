Israel 's Wye Suspension Augurs Ill for Mideast ,
CAIRO , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Egypt has warned that Israel 's halt to the implementation of the Wye River accord will lead to collapse of the Middle East peace process and violence in the region .
In an interview with a national daily Al Gomhuria , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said suspension of the implementation of the accord is " very dangerous " .
" This plays havoc with constant world efforts to establish peace , stability and security in the region , " Mubarak told the mouthpiece of the ruling National Democratic Party .
Under the Wye River peace accord signed with the Palestinians in October , Israel should withdraw from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three phases .
After carrying out the first phase of the withdrawal , Israel suspended the implementation of the second phase , citing Palestinians ' failure to stop anti-Israeli rhetoric and cancel the plan to declare an independent state next May .
Israel 's failure to honor the agreement " can result in the collapse of peace process and plunge the region anew into a state of chaos and violence , " Mubarak said .
The Egyptian leader called on the United States , which brokered the Wye accord , European Union , all peace-loving countries and Israeli people to endeavor to keep the peace drive on the right track .
Mubarak stressed the Palestinian people have the " historical rights " to regain their land and establish their own state , which will be secured in a just and durable peace .
