Given how much time your family spends in the car , you want your vehicle to be as safe as possible .
Lessen the chances of mishap or injury with these safety , maintenance and driving strategies .
& QL ; & UR ; - 0 - & QL ; & UR ; CHILD-SAFETY SEATS & LR ; & QL ;
All kids , especially those in car seats , are safest riding in the back .
Make sure that your child uses the right safety seat for her age and weight _ a rear-facing seat for infants up to 1 year and 20 pounds , a forward-facing seat for children over 1 year and weighing up to 40 pounds , and a booster seat for kids who are too big for a car seat and too small to fit correctly in a lap / shoulder seat belt .
Some safety seats can not fit in some cars because of the configuration of their belts or the shape of the seat .
When buying a car seat , be aware that it might not fit your vehicle .
You may need to return it and try another .
Read the safety-seat instructions and your car manual carefully to make sure you install the seat correctly _ as many as half of all safety seats are used improperly .
& UR ; TIRES & LR ; & QL ;
Some tires are made for speed , some for control and some for bad weather .
Tell the salesperson your priorities before buying .
Worn or improperly inflated tires give you less control when steering and braking , and may be prone to blowouts .
To check the treads on your tires , stick a penny into the grooves .
They should be deep enough to touch the top of Lincoln 's head .
If the tread is unevenly worn , replace the tire .
To extend the life of your tires , it 's important to keep them inflated at the recommended air pressure , which can be found in the owner 's manual , on a label in the glove compartment or on the driver 's doorjamb .
Check the air pressure of your tires monthly with a pressure gauge , which is inexpensive and easy to use .
& UR ; EMERGENCY KIT & LR ; & QL ;
You should carry these items in your trunk in case of a breakdown :
+ flares or a reflective triangle
+ a well-stocked first-aid kit
+ jumper cables
+ a can of tire inflater
+ gloves
+ rags or paper towels .
In cold weather , add an ice scraper , a shovel , a bag of nonclumping cat litter _ for traction on ice _ spray de-icer and a blanket .
& UR ; GLOVE COMPARTMENT & LR ; & QL ;
Keep your glove compartment stocked with a flashlight , a tire-pressure gauge , your owner 's manual and maps of your home state and of anywhere else you may be driving .
It 's also a good idea to travel with a cellular phone in case of an emergency .
Note : Using a cell phone and driving at the same time can be as dangerous as driving drunk .
If you must make a call , pull off the road first .
& UR ; BRAKES & LR ; & QL ;
Antilock-braking systems prevent skids by automatically easing the brake pressure on the wheels before they lock up .
This helps the driver maintain control during emergency braking .
Because the braking technique for ABS is different from that for standard brakes , some drivers misuse them .
If you have an ABS , learn the proper emergency-braking technique : Don n't pump the brakes to avoid a skid _ instead , keep your foot firmly on the brake , and let the ABS pump the brakes for you .
Try practicing in an empty parking lot .
& UR ; SEAT BELTS & LR ; & QL ;
Making sure that you and your kids wear your seat belts correctly every time you get in a car is the most effective way to prevent injury in a crash .
The shoulder belt should fit straight across the chest without cutting into the neck .
The lap belt should lie low and snug across the lap , not across the abdomen .
& UR ; AIR BAGS & LR ; & QL ;
All new vehicles in the United States have driver-side and passenger-side air bags .
Though air bags have saved thousands of lives , they can cause injury or even death if a passenger is too close to one when it deploys .
Always wear your seat belt , and sit so that your breastbone is at least 10 inches from where the air bag deploys _ either the steering wheel or the passenger-side dashboard .
The safest place for kids under 13 to ride is in the back seat , properly restrained .
If you can n't avoid having a child ride up front , put the oldest in front , properly secured , and slide the seat as far back as it will go .
Never place a rear-facing car seat in the front seat of a car with a passenger-side air bag .
Drivers can now petition the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for permission to have an air-bag on / off switch put in their vehicle , but this option will be needed by only a few people , such as those with no alternative but to place an infant or child in the front seat .
& UR ; WINDSHIELD & LR ; & QL ;
Worn wiper blades can reduce visibility by insufficiently clearing off rain and snow .
Change your blades at least twice a year , at the start of spring and of winter .
Grime and debris also reduce visibility , so keep the windshield-washer reservoir filled with no-freeze washer fluid , and remember to use it frequently .
& UR ; UNDER THE HOOD & LR ; & QL ;
+ Battery .
A leading cause of breakdowns is a weak battery .
Extreme heat or cold can make a battery lose power , so if yours is more than two years old , ask your mechanic for a load check before driving in very hot or cold weather .
+ Radiator .
Extreme heat or cold can make the water in your radiator evaporate or freeze .
Check regularly to make sure the radiator is filled with a 50 / 50 mix of water and antifreeze / coolant .
+ Oil .
Keeping your oil clean and at the right level is important .
Pull the dipstick once a month to see if you need to add oil _ your owner 's manual will have information on proper maintenance .
