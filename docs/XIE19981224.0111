LUSAKA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Zambian government has released 4.5 billion Kwacha ( about 2.2 million U.S. Dollars ) for the Constituency Development Fund ( CDF ) , bringing the total released this year alone to nine billion Kwacha .
Times of Zambia Thursday quoted Local Government and Housing Minister Bennie Mwiinga as saying his ministry began Wednesday transferring 30 million Kwacha to each of the 150 constituencies through the CDF bank accounts .
" This means that this year alone , CDF committee will have received 60 million Kwacha each for disbursement to various constituency development projects .
This obviously puts us up to date with the disbursement of these funds to constituencies in the last two financial years , " he said .
He urged all CDF committees to speedily meet and approve development projects in their constituencies so that funding could be made as the money would be available before Christmas day .
The government released the other 4.5 billion Kwacha in April this year .
Mwiinga said some constituencies have already started funding projects from the initial 4.5 billion kwacha and urged the committees that have not yet been constituted to do so quickly .
