WHAT 'S NEW ON VIDEOTAPE ?
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By MICHAEL BLOWEN c.1998 The Boston Globe
NEW RELEASES : & UR ; `` Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil '' & LR ; _ The key to the success of John Berendt 's best-selling book on which this movie is based is its marvelous evocation of Savannah , Ga. The city is as mysterious as Garbo _ elusive , sexy , dangerous .
The problem with the film is that Clint Eastwood shoots the city as a tourist might , producing beautiful snapshots but not much else .
One of the problems is John Cusack 's performance as the reporter-narrator .
He gets in the way of the story of murder , mayhem , and female impersonation .
& UR ; `` Oscar and Lucinda '' & LR ; _ Gillian Armstrong directs this magnificent story of passion , gambling , and organized religion .
Ralph Fiennes , as the gambling-obsessed cleric , brings a manic intensity , leavened by humor , to the role .
A smart picture for smart people .
& UR ; `` Home Alone 3 '' & LR ; _ Three strikes and you 're out at home .
& UR ; `` The Student Affair '' & LR ; _ This embarassing hodgepodge of dreamy sex and marital breakup stars Ed Begley Jr. and Sally Kellerman as a marriage-on-the-rocks couple whose lives are changed when a gorgeous babe enters the picture .
Gee , I wonder where they came up with that idea ?
Kellerman and Begley probably needed one more film to be vested in the Screen Actors Guild pension .
That would be the only excuse for appearing in this awful movie .
