U.S. Issues Controversial Anti-Drug Certification
WASHINGTON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. administration Thursday announced an annual anti-drug certification decision , which is certain to be criticized by countries in the blacklist .
President Bill Clinton granted " full certification " to 22 of the 30 countries which were termed as " major drug-producing and transit countries , " Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced at a press conference .
Cambodia , Colombia , Pakistan and Paraguay " were not certified for cooperation , but were granted national interest waivers " while Afghanistan , Burma , Iran and Nigeria " were denied certification outright , " said Albright .
The certification process started in 1986 .
If a country is denied full certification , there is a complete cut-off of sales or financing of weapons , counternarcotics help and other assistance .
When a country receives a vital national interests certification , assistance is provided in the same manner as if it had been given full certification .
Albright said the administration has decided to waive two-year old sanctions against that Colombia , citing success made by the country in fighting narcotics .
Waiver of the sanctions means that there will be fewer impediments to U.S. assistance to Colombia 's anti-drug efforts .
Colombia also will be spared economic penalties for the coming year .
The certification process , first required by Congress in 1986 , is widely criticized by many countries , where it is seen as counterproductive .
Noting that the certification process is a kind of interference in their domestic affairs , the countries say the root cause of the drug problem is insatiable U.S. demand .
