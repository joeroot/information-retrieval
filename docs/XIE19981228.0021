Smallest Houston Octuplet Dies
Los Angeles , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The smallest of the Houston octuplets died this Sunday morning from heart and lung failure , according to Texas Children 's Hospital where the baby and her siblings have been under care .
The baby was the fifth of the octuplets born to a Nigerian-American couple on December 20 .
She weighed only 320 grams at birth .
Her condition began to deteriorate significantly Saturday afternoon , when doctors moved her from a conventional ventilator to an oscillator in an attempt to improve her blood oxygenation , said the hospital in an online press briefing .
Despite that , her oxygen levels remained poor and she began to suffer episodes of low heart rates .
Attempts to reestablish normal heart rates with medication and chest compressions were unsuccessful , the hospital added .
Meanwhile , the hospital said , the youngest of the octuplets is in critical condition after undergoing abdominal surgery yesterday to repair an intestinal perforation .
The firstborn of the octuplets and the firstborn boy are also in critical condition and breathing with the assistance of a ventilator .
Other four babies are all listed in critical condition , but are breathing on their own , the hospital said .
