Godzilla was going about his business in a Times Square theater one afternoon last week when he discovered a murdered infant godzilla and shrieked in anguish ( 118 decibels ) .
Then he was strafed by fighter jets ( 105 to 115 decibels for five minutes ) .
Finally , he died ( 67 decibels ) .
As a wave of ear-splitting summer movies arrives at theaters , ears ache or hiss or buzz the way they do after a rock concert .
The moviegoers to whom they are attached wonder whether it 's just their imagination or whether the volume of the soundtrack was at jet-engine levels .
Almost : Jets take off at an eardrum-rupturing 150 decibels .
`` Of course movies are louder than they used to be , '' said Leonard Maltin , the critic for the television program Entertainment Tonight .
`` It 's a question of whether it 's an entertainment or an assault . ''
Either way , it is the result of the digital-sound age , which has brought hiss-free soundtracks and multi-channel systems with more knobs and meters than an airplane cockpit .
And there are giant subwoofers under seats and speakers everywhere .
But the problem is not just with the equipment in theaters .
When big-budget films are mixed in a way that makes gunfire crystal-clear but muffles the speech , some frustrated moviegoers see a metaphor for everything that is wrong with Hollywood .
They long for perfectionist projectionists like the Philippe Noiret character in `` Cinema Paradiso . ''
Uneasiness about ear-splitting volume in movie theaters prompted a panel discussion at the Cannes Film Festival this month titled , `` Are Movies Too Loud ? ''
The consensus seemed to be yes , according to Variety , the show business newspaper that was a sponsor of the session .
It said that creative types and executives shared a common concern about too-loud soundtracks .
`` People go to the movies for a bigger experience than other entertainment , '' Variety quoted Mario Van Peebles , the director of the 1991 drug-world drama `` New Jack City , '' as saying , `` but they have to be able to hear the dialogue . ''
How loud the sound should be is already an issue for the Newport International Film Festival in Rhode Island , and it doesn n't even open until Tuesday .
The festival 's organizers have been holding test screenings in their rented theater , a gilt-trimmed relic from the days of pipe organs and uniformed ushers .
They listen for a minute or two , then ask each other , Is that too loud ?
`` People expect a movie now to be like a roller coaster ride , '' said Christine Schomer , the festival 's executive director .
`` With these summer movies especially , every one has to out-top each other , and the only way to do that is to make them as loud as possible .
And the thing is , the movie costs so much , they 're tricking us into thinking it 's more entertaining the louder it gets . ''
How loud ?
At a showing of `` Quest for Camelot '' in Stamford , Conn. , the decibel level was in the 70 to 75 range , with 85 - to 90-decibel bursts .
But the previews were even louder : one for `` Rugrats '' registered 80 decibels , except when it surged to 87 .
The moment it started , a 4-year-old clamped her hands over her ears and kept them there .
`` Put it softer , Mommy , '' she implored .
`` Bulworth , '' in a New York City theater , was in the 68 - to 70-decibel range .
But during the louder sequences when Warren Beatty was delivering line after line of rapping rhyme , the meter climbed to 106 , even 109 at one point .
That is significantly louder than a garbage truck ( 85 decibels ) , jackhammer ( 88 decibels ) or a car alarm ( 80 decibels ) .
But going strictly by numbers misses a more fundamental point .
Several times at a another showing of `` Bulworth , '' one back-row moviegoer repeatedly asked her husband what Beatty had just said .
Patricia King Hanson , the editor of the American Film Institute Catalog , sees irony in the notion that Beatty has become hard to hear .
He was , she said , `` one of the great pioneers in having this ultraloud sound in ` Bonnie and Clyde . '' '
So `` Godzilla '' is what `` Bonnie and Clyde '' has wrought .
But too-loud soundtracks are about more than monsters that are longer than the lines outside the theater .
Noise causes stress , even hearing loss .
Various studies have linked prolonged exposure to noise of between 85 and 115 decibels with an assortment of physical , mental and social problems ranging from hypertension to helplessness , from learning disabilities to birth defects .
Everyday noise can send a sound-level meter into the overload zone , and there is no question that entertainment is noisier than it was before the invention of electric guitars .
But Tom Horral , the technical director of Acentech , an acoustical-engineering company in Boston , blames the complaints about overly loud movies on 1990's technology that eliminated so-called residual noise , making the soundtrack purer .
In the bass range , for instance , sounds that once were distorted into noise by increasing the volume can now be played loudly without significant distortion .
Multiplexing has created another problem : Sound spills into the theater next door .
`` In the building and planning of multiplexes , '' Maltin said , `` they think they take this into account .
What they haven n't taken into account is the vibrations caused by the ever more sophisticated sound systems .
When Godzilla stomps its mighty foot , they want the theater to shake from not just the sound but the tremor . ''
