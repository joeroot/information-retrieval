China 's Securities Market Has Great Potential , Says Expert
SHANGHAI , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's securities market has great potential and is an important component of the country 's market economy , according to the General Manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange , Tu Shaoguang .
" As the securities market has expanded and matured in recent years , it has become a true parameter of the national economy , " he added .
The Chinese securities market was established eight years ago when the Shanghai bourse , the country 's first , was set up .
Tu explained that the Chinese securities market was able to continue to grow steadily this year because of China 's sustained economic growth and the increasing expertise of businesses involved in resisting financial risks .
Another reason for the relative insulation of the China market from financial turbulence in other parts of Asia and the world is that China 's financial market continues to be only partially open .
" The functions of the securities market have now extended beyond simply fund raising , as corporate restructuring and listing have helped to transform the operations of China 's large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , " Tu said .
As more companies from various sectors have been listed , the market 's interaction with the national economy has increased .
At the end of November official statistics show that 430 companies were listed on the Shanghai bourse , with the market capitalization of stocks issued totaling 1.14 trillion yuan .
Some 19.9 million investors have opened trading accounts on the Shanghai Stock Exchange .
" And as China 's measures to spur domestic demand are expected to take effect and the economy is seen likely to continue to grow rapidly , there will be an even better environment for the securities market next year , " Tu added .
" Taking a long-term perspective , continued reform and sustained economic growth will enable our securities market to have potentially broad prospects , " he said .
Besides the Shanghai bourse , China has another stock exchange in the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen .
Altogether China currently has around 850 listed companies and more than 38 million stock investors .
