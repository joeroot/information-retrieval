Philippine Bankers Group Backs Raising Bank Capital
MANILA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) - The Bankers Association of the Philippines Monday voiced its support for a move of the central bank to increase the minimum capital requirements of banks in the country .
Deogracias Vistan , president of the association , said in an interview that there is a strong need to introduce changes in the minimum capitalization of banks to respond to the currency crisis .
As a requirement of the central bank , universal banks in the country are directed to boost their capital base by 80 percent .
The central bank recently also encouraged banks , particularly those which could not cope with the increase in minimum capitalization , to consolidate and merge .
Vistan described the central bank 's move as the best and meaningful way to strengthen the banking industry 's operations .
