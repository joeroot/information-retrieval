China Protects Largest Inland Fresh-Water Lake
URUMQI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- China has taken a series of steps to protect Bosten Lake , the largest inland fresh-water lake in the country , and these efforts are producing results .
Monitoring results by local environmental departments show that the water level in the lake , located in northwest China 's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , has stopped dropping , the mineralization of the lake water has been eased , and the environment around the lake is improving .
Projects to protect the lake have included the construction of water diversion projects , popularization of water-saving technologies , and the exploitation and use of underground water .
These measures have reduced the amount of water taken from the lake to irrigate surrounding farmland from 1.27 billion cubic meters to 1.02 billion cubic meters annually .
At the same time , local governments have restricted the establishment of polluting enterprises on the lake side , and seven heavily polluting enterprises have been closed since last year .
The Bosten Lake used to be home to more than 20 kinds of fish and was one of the four largest reed production bases in the country .
However , the water area of the lake was reduced by 130 square kilometers , and the water level dropped by nearly two meters for a variety of reasons .
A project aimed at reclaiming 20,000 hectares for reed production to curb the saltization of the lake water is now underway .
