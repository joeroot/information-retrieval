WHY A UTILITY CHAIRMAN SEEKS OWNERSHIP OF A BASEBALL TEAM
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By MARTIN ROSENBERG c.
1998 Kansas City Star
KANSAS CITY , Mo. -- John E. Hayes Jr. , known in the utility world as a consummate deal maker , now wants to add the Kansas City Royals to Western Resources ' bulging trophy case .
Hayes admits that Western , which pitches electric current and burglary systems , may be out in left field when it comes to sports .
When a skeptical stockholder recently asked Hayes why the company should own a sports team , `` a rich man 's toy , '' Hayes asked for his trust .
Hayes , Western 's chairman , pointed out , `` We have a tendency to move the envelope and do things that are not traditional . ''
So who is `` untraditional '' John Hayes ?
And what drove him to team up Western Resources with sports impresario Lamar Hunt in bidding for the Royals ?
The answer is complex , much like the silver-haired , amiable yet sometimes combative Hayes .
Hayes has no intention of becoming a George Steinbrenner on the Plains .
For starters , he said with a chuckle , his net worth is a `` few zeros less '' than that of the Yankees ' owner .
And while Hayes likes sports _ he is a University of Kansas basketball fan _ he has been to just one or two Royals games since the beginning of last season .
His take : Someone had to step forward and make a credible offer to keep the Royals in Kansas City , or the region 's prestige _ and economy _ would be harmed , and utilities like Western don n't like to serve communities in decline .
Other factors may have prodded Western to acquire a stake in the Royals :
-- Western Resources is in the closing innings of its two-year campaign to acquire Kansas City Power & AMP ; Light Co. , which will need the blessing of state regulators in Jefferson City and Topeka .
Hayes is considered a master in the regulatory arena by other corporate executives and past regulators .
Winning political good will by saving the Royals for Kansas City may help Western on the regulatory front .
-- Western seeks a new identity as it rapidly moves away from its origins as a regulated energy monopoly to a company selling security and other services .
It plans to spin off its electric operations , along with KCP&AMP ; L 's , into a new company called Westar Energy , to be based in Kansas City .
Western and Westar will need more visibility as competition arrives in their business .
Around the country , utilities are paying to slap their names on sports stadiums .
Western is quiet about how it plans to exploit its association with the Royals _ and whether a Westar Field will be the future home of the Royals .
But count on this : Western intends to make money from its association with the Royals in a variety of ways .
-- Hayes , 60 , is trying to prepare for a `` soft landing '' as he enters the twilight of his career .
He will give up the chairmanship of Western early next year , turning the job over to president David C. Wittig .
Hayes will move on to head up Westar .
Hayes will remain at Westar `` until it 's off the ground , '' and he plans to remain involved with Western 's investment in the Royals .
Hayes declined to discuss his plans for the team while the bids for its ownership are evaluated .
Hunt Sports Group , a Hunt family trust , would be managing partner and would operate the team , while a Western Resources subsidiary also would be half owner .
Other publicly identified bidders for the Royals include E. Miles Prentice , a New York lawyer , and a group headed by George and Bobby Brett .
Those who have worked closely with Hayes through the years describe him as a visionary and a tenacious adversary who is self-confident and sensitive to others .
`` He 's a major league business executive , '' said William Steinmeier , former chairman of the Missouri Public Service Commission .
Gene Budig , president of baseball 's American League , said , `` John Hayes is one of enormous ability and unique sensitivity . ''
Budig was on Western 's board when it hired Hayes in 1989 , but Budig recently relinquished the board seat to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest on Royals matters .
Budig recalled Hayes ' commitment to excellence .
When Western Resources , like other utilities , had problems sending out accurate bills to customers in the winter of 1996 - 1997 , Hayes was cross .
`` He was emotional on the billing issue , '' Budig said .
`` He wanted to safeguard the credibility of the company .
One never had to wonder about John 's feelings . ''
That is because he is an executive who knows his own mind .
`` He is a person who believes in himself , '' Budig said .
`` He is often tenacious in representing his agenda .
...
We believed in him .
We clearly adopted his vision of many issues .
He is a person of intellect who outworks most people in his chosen field . ''
