UNDATED : talk about himself . ''
All those years of keeping the focus on the music means that people now don n't expect any details , juicy or otherwise .
And it 's not as if Strait is a total mystery .
We know he grew up in Pearsall ; his parents separated when George was young ; and he and his older brother , Buddy , were raised by his father , John , a math teacher and part-time rancher .
We know that Strait attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos , enlisted in the Army in 1971 , and was in for three years , stationed in Hawaii .
That is where he began singing in a band ; when he returned to San Marcos ( he graduated with a degree in agriculture ) , he began playing bars , gradually becoming more and more popular .
And we know that Strait signed with MCA in February 1981 ; his first single for the label , `` Unwound , '' charted in early May , just before he turned 29 .
His first LP , `` Strait Country , '' was released that September , and within a few years _ on the strength of songs such as `` Right or Wrong , '' `` Amarillo by Morning '' and `` You Look So Good in Love '' _ he was a major star .
Then , on June 25 , 1986 , his 13-year-old daughter , Jenifer , was killed in a car accident near San Marcos .
Strait 's career has continued to prosper despite changing times ; he was named the Country Music Association 's Entertainer of the Year in 1989 and 1990 and was named Male Vocalist of the Year four times by the CMA and three times by the Academy of Country Music .
He is a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and hosts the George Strait Team Roping Classic each June in Kingsville .
And then , of course , there was The Dog Incident : In 1996 his Australian heeler , Buster , disappeared from his South Texas ranch .
Strait offered a reward , and half the state , it seems , went looking for the dog .
Buster was never found .
`` This tells you about George 's status in Texas , '' says West .
`` You can n't imagine the phone calls , the number of people thinking they had found him . ''
John Wheat , sound archivist for the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin , says Strait `` appeals to people who want at least a modicum of authenticity .
People still revere western culture , and authenticity is hard to find in country music .
He isn n't trying to fit his music into pop music trends .
Country has folk music roots _ it 's concerned with people 's daily lives _ and George is still in that camp .
`` He doesn n't sell himself as competing with rock bands .
He knows about ranching , and he doesn n't get away from it and go live in Los Angeles or Nashville .
He 's a quiet , strong , self-effacing character .
He holds himself back , and people appreciate it . ''
Linda O ' Brian , music director and assistant program director at Dallas-Fort Worth radio station KSCS / 96.3 FM , says Strait appeals because he `` just seems so normal .
Everything he does is done with this quiet strength _ you don n't think of him as having issues , so people don n't ask about him .
They just want to meet him .
Everybody wants to meet him .
He just has this really incredible sense of self ; the songs aren n't by him , because he 's not a songwriter , but they sound like him . ''
And thats , says old pal Clay Blaker , is the way Strait has always been .
The two met in 1976 , when they were both playing bars on the Austin / San Antonio / Houston circuit .
Blaker 's band did `` around 100 '' shows with Strait 's , and then Strait invited him along as an opener in the '80s .
Also , Strait has cut eight Blaker songs , including `` She Lays It All on the Line '' on the `` Pure Country '' soundtrack .
`` Whenever I 'm around him , he 's the same old George to me , '' says Blaker .
`` He 's very nice and polite and shy .
He 's always pretty much kept to himself , but he 's very friendly to his friends .
And he has a lot of the same friends he had before he got a record deal ; that 'll tell you something right there .
`` I think the reason he 's still at the top of his game can be attributed to you don n't see him in magazines all the time or on TV all the time ; there 's still a mystique about him that 's a result of the way he is .
In today 's market , there 's so many people that are so overexposed ; you 're a star for 15 minutes , and then you 're gone .
He 's a competitor , he takes his career real seriously , and he wants to go out there and prove he can still cut it . ''
Which , of course , he still can .
The question now is , how long will Strait 's career continue ?
Given what he 's chosen to do and chosen not to do , one can easily see him making one final , grand gesture , one final release and series of concerts , and then gracefully riding off into the sunset .
It might be a lame metaphor for many other singers , but not for him .
`` There 's an acknowledgement that this won n't go on forever , '' says West .
`` Eventually George will decide .
It won n't be decided for him .
He 's the master of his universe ; he controls his own fate . ''
And it 's very possible that , even at the very end , Strait will be what he 's always been : the lone figure on the plain , silent but for the songs he sings , not feeling the need to talk to anyone about his private life or career decisions .
With one exception .
`` He wants to talk to Cigar Aficionado magazine , '' says West with a chuckle .
`` He loves cigars , and he wants to do an interview .
I don n't know if they 'll do it _ they put a lot of Hollywood people on the cover _ but we 're testing the waters .
They haven n't asked . ''
