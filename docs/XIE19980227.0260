NATO Chief Calls for NATO-Russia Cooperation
BUDAPEST , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) Javier Solana said Thursday that NATO 's expansion is not directed at Russia and will not create a new dividing line in Europe .
Solana , who arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit , made the remarks during a meeting of the foreign relations and defense sections of the National Assembly of Hungary .
He said NATO hopes to carry out a dialogue with Russia on military and security issues and believes the two sides will ultimately cooperate .
Justifying NATO 's expansion , Solana said the expansion is not only an important part of the European integration process , but also the basis upon which NATO 's reform plans rest .
Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic have been invited to join NATO in 1999 when the alliance celebrates its 50th anniversary .
NATO will not close its doors to countries applying for membership who meet the standards of the bloc .
The concept that NATO will end its expansion process after the admission of current applications for new membership is wrong , Solana stressed .
During talks with Hungarian leaders , including President Arpad Goncz and Prime Minister Gyula Horn , Solana expressed satisfaction with ties between NATO and Hungary .
He said Hungary is the " most stable " nation in Central Europe .
