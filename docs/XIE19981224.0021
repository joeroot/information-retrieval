China Develops First IC-Card Chip
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The first integrated circuit that China developed for making telephone IC-card passed official appraisal by the Ministry of Information Industry ( MII ) here today .
Developers told a press conference this evening that the integrated circuit chip is priced at two-thirds of that of imported counterparts .
China has produced more than 100 million IC-cards since it first introduced IC-card telephone in 1995 .
All these cards were made with chips from overseas , mainly from Germany and France .
MII forecasts that in 2000 , Chinese people will buy more than 250 million IC-cards as 700,000 intelligent public telephones are installed throughout the country .
IC-card uses an integrated circuit , or a computer chip , to store the value of money .
It is more reliable and secure than magnetic telephone cards .
China is to stop using the existing 60,000 magnetic card public telephones in three to four years .
The new IC-card chip was jointly developed by Datang Telecom Technology Co. , LTD and Qinghua University in Beijing .
The chip will be manufactured by Shanghai Advanced Semi-Conductor Manufacturing Company , a joint venture with Philips of the Netherlands and Nortel Networks of Canada .
The chip has already been tested in China Telecom 's public telephone networks in five locations in China and will be put into mass production in February , 1999 .
Production capacity of the chip will reach 450,000 to 500,000 in 1999 .
MII official Zheng Minzheng hopes that the new chip will give rise to a local IC-card industry in a few years .
China 's integrated circuit market reached 6.5 billion yuan this year , with 2.5 billion items of integrated circuit sold .
Most of them were from international companies .
