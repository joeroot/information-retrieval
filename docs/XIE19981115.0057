Kurdish Leader Asks for Political Asylum
ROME , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Abdullah Ocalan , chief of the Kurdish Workers ' Party ( PKK ) and also the most wanted man by Turkey , filed a formal request Saturday for political asylum in Italy .
According to Italy 's Interior Ministry sources , the asylum request has now been compiled , signed and formally submitted .
Ocalan 's lawyer Giuliano Pisapia said that on Thursday the chief of the PKK , which has been outlawed by Turkey , would be soon questioned by an Italian prosecutor on whether to accept any extradition request that may have arrived in the meantime .
The Kurdish leader was sought under arrest warrants from both Germany and Turkey when he was detained by Italian frontier police Thursday evening after flying from Moscow .
An Italian appeals court judge confirmed his arrest on Friday .
A spokesman for the PKK , which began an armed struggle for Kurdish independence from Turkey under Ocalan 's leadership in 1984 , said the Italian authorities " knew " he was arriving in Italy .
Akif Hassan , the European spokesman of the Ernk , the Kurdish liberation front , said negotiations had been held between Ocalan himself and the Italian government through unidentified Italian " mediators " before he left Russia .
Hassan said he was surprised that Ocalan was said to be under arrest since there were assurances that this would not happen .
According to Hassan , the PKK leader is in hospital due to " health problems . "
The PKK 's top official in Europe , Kani Yilmaz , said Ocalan had decided to come to Italy to " open the path to peace " in his homeland .
Yilmaz said the Kurds are looking for a solution which " can be sought from here . "
The PKK is also asking the Italian government to grant the political asylum , he added .
