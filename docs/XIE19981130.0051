Did Acid Rain Kill the Dinosaur ?
( 2 )
He said it is suspected that severed acid rain at the end of Cretaceous period dissolved trace elements including strontium into the soil .
Dinosaurs could have ingested strontium from water and food both directly and indirectly , causing them to finally became extinct .
Many scientists believe the Earth was hit by a meteor at the end of the Cretaceous period .
" If it was a metal meteorite , the content of nitrogen oxide in Earth 's atmosphere could have increased 100 to 1,000 fold .
If it was a comet , nitrogen oxide might have increased 10 million to 100 million fold .
The result of both is severe acid rain , " said Deng .
" We still don n't know whether a high strontium content will also be found in fossilized dinosaur eggs in other places around the world , " he said .
He added that small mammals emerged on earth at the end of Cretaceous period , and the acid rain also affected them .
But unlike the gigantic dinosaurs , the small mammals could easily change their habits and adapt to the environment .
