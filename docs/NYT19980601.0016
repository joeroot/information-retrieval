QWEST EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM
( lb ) By SETH SCHIESEL c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
Qwest Communications International Inc. , which is preparing to complete its $ 4.4 billion acquisition of LCI International Inc. , plans to announce its new senior management team Monday .
Most of LCI 's top executives , including its chairman and chief executive , Brian Thompson , will remain with Qwest .
Thompson will become Qwest 's vice chairman .
The two companies have received all of the federal regulatory approvals they require to complete their merger .
Shareholders of Qwest , based in Denver , and LCI are set to vote on the deal on Friday .
If Worldcom Inc. 's $ 37 billion acquisition of MCI Communications Corp. wins government approval , the combined Qwest-LCI will become the United States ' No. 4 long-distance telephone company .
Joseph Nacchio , who left AT&AMP ; T Corp. after he was passed over for that company 's top job , will remain Qwest 's president and chief executive .
Philip Anschutz , the Denver oil and railroad magnate who controls Qwest , will remain the company 's chairman .
Anne Bingaman , LCI 's aggressive regulatory affairs chief , is the most senior LCI executive who is not a member of the team that Qwest plans to announce Monday .
Before joining LCI last year , Ms. Bingaman ran the Justice Department 's antitrust division .
Since leaving the government she has become an outspoken foe of the Bell local telephone companies , proposing that they each be split in half .
After completing the LCI acquisition , Nacchio will have 12 people reporting to him .
Five of the people , including Lawrence Bouman , LCI 's senior vice president for engineering , will have come from LCI .
Besides the ex-LCI executives , almost every member of Qwest 's top management team will have come from larger companies , including AT&AMP ; T , Lucent , GTE and U S West .
The telecommunications industry is one of the few sectors in which talented executives routinely follow career paths in which they move from larger to smaller companies .
