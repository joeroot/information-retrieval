BIG LOSSES TO CONFRONT LIVENT 'S NEW LEADER
( ATTN . : N.Y . , Calif. , Canada ) ( ja ) By BRUCE WEBER c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ Michael Ovitz had better relish a challenge .
Livent Inc. , the Toronto-based entertainment company that Ovitz is to assume control of this week , has announced that it lost $ 20 million in the first quarter of the year , which , added to grim financial results for 1997 , means the company has lost approximately $ 50 million over the last 15 months .
Livent , the producer of recent Broadway musicals like `` Ragtime , '' `` Show Boat '' and `` Kiss of the Spider Woman , '' is the world 's only publicly held company whose primary business is live theater production .
Over the last five years it has borrowed heavily to build theaters _ notably the Ford Centers for the Performing Arts in Vancouver , New York City and Chicago ( the Chicago theater is scheduled to open in October ) _ and to begin creating several musicals from scratch , of which `` Ragtime , '' which now has three companies running , is the first .
In its statement , issued Friday , the company said the quarterly loss , which compared with a profit of $ 2 million in the first quarter of 1997 , was largely a result of the planned closing later this year of one of its two productions of `` Show Boat , '' which is now playing in Washington and San Francisco .
Livent 's accounting required the company to count all of the money it spent to put together the show as an expense in the last quarter .
A portion of preproduction expenses is recognized as an expense each quarter in a process known as amortization .
But if a show closes , all of those costs must be recognized at once .
By recognizing the expenses immediately , which was done with the input of the new management , Livent effectively removed costs that could have weighed down its financial performance in the future .
The company went public in 1993 , and the stock , which reached a high of $ 12.75 last July , began to slide when `` Ragtime , '' a show the company hoped would support the company until its other projects were ready to be presented , performed poorly in a pre-Broadway run in Los Angeles .
In spite of the show 's success so far in New York _ it garnered 13 Tony Award nominations and has been virtually selling out at the Ford Center each week _ the company was viewed by Wall Street to be too heavily debt-ridden and the stock price never recovered ; it closed at $ 8.125 Monday .
In April , the company announced a retooling of its top leadership .
Ovitz , the former Hollywood power broker who has been largely absent from entertainment since his much publicized departure from Disney Corp. in December 1996 , bought $ 20 million of Livent stock and will join the company as a board member and chairman of the executive committee .
Ovitz and his management team , led by the investment banker Roy Furman , who replaces Garth Drabinsky as chairman and chief executive officer , are officially to assume control of the company if , as expected , the shift is approved at a shareholders meeting on Friday .
Drabinsky , who previously ran the company 's creative and financial sides , remains with the company as chief creative director , i.e. , as a theater producer .
