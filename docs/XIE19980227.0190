Demobilization of Remanent UNITA Soldiers Ends
LUANDA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- United Nations deputy representative in Angola Behrooz Sadry announced that the demobilization work of the remanent soldiers of Angola 's former rebel UNITA movement ends at zero hour Friday .
He made the announcement to the press here on Thursday night after returning from investigations in the southeastern Moxico Province into violations of the peace accord .
However , he said , it is difficult to accomplish all tasks of the peace process as prescribed by both the Angolan government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) on Saturday due to slow progress .
Up to Thursday , only 5,700 of UNITA 's 7,800 remnant militiamen had been disbanded .
Sadry pledged that he will keep in touch with the government and UNITA to ensure that those who are not demobilized by the scheduled date get their due welfare .
The U.N. representative went on to announce that a meeting of the joint commission will be held here Friday to discuss relevant issues concerning the peace process , especially on recent violations of the Lusaka Peace Agreement .
