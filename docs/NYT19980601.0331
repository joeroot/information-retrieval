Alice Saltzman sees her part-time job as a mission .
By working with medical students , she hopes to make one of the most uncomfortable aspects of medicine a gentler , less intimidating process _ for both patient and doctor .
A New York social worker turned actress , Ms. Saltzman , 36 , and her colleagues around the country are playing an increasingly important role in medical education .
Called genital teaching associates , or GTAs , they use their bodies as models to teach breast , pelvic and genital-urinary examination techniques to medical students , residents and even doctors .
`` When I was a social worker , I became very concerned about how women were treated , '' Ms. Saltzman said .
When she learned about the associates through a colleague who was in the field , she became curious .
`` I wasn n't sure I was going to be able to do it .
But now , I feel like I 'm helping women all over the world .
It 's very empowering . ''
Some days , she said , `` I come home feeling like I 've done such a world of good . ''
Since being introduced in the 1970s , teaching associate programs have expanded to nearly half the nation 's medical schools , if not more , said Gayle Gliva-McConvey , a pioneer in the programs and the director of the professional skills center at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk .
Such programs are reaching more and more students , in effect changing the way the intimate examinations are conducted , one fledgling doctor at a time .
Now , in the era of managed care , the associate 's role has become even more important , as health care companies closely guard their doctors ' hours , said Ms. Gliva-McConvey .
But the greater service is provided by helping to train more nurses , doctors and other practitioners to handle one of the most stressful parts of patient examinations _ and in fact to conduct genital examinations at all .
Men and women are involved in associate programs , but the emphasis has always been on women .
`` It was pretty clear we were doing a pretty terrible job teaching medical students how to do pelvic exams , '' said Dr. Robert Kretzschmar , now in private practice in Iowa City , Iowa .
Teaching was done at clinics on indigent patients who had no choice by `` terrified medical students looking at female genitalia on a live person for the first time , '' Kretzschmar recalled from the early 1960s when he was an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa .
A few years later , Kretzschmar sowed the seeds of the nation 's `` standardized patient '' programs , using average people to pose as patients for medical students .
He started teaching medical interviewing techniques to his students using the wives of fellow staff physicians at the University of Iowa .
By the late 1960s , he had made the leap to the genital teaching associates , employing an aide from the urology department who had agreed to be a model for pelvic exams .
She requested to be draped so she could remain anonymous .
`` The person was being paid , and not exploited , '' he said , unlike the disadvantaged women at the clinic .
`` It was a great improvement , '' he added .
But it still was not what he wanted : `` I wanted to get rid of the drape .
I wanted the patient to interact with the students . ''
At professional meetings throughout the 1970s , he explained his program and the idea took off , he said .
One medical school hired prostitutes for its program .
Others placed ads in local newspapers .
Kretzschmar , though , set about finding bright women who were good teachers and who wanted to contribute to medical education .
He offered $ 25 an hour .
`` These people could do a better job of teaching than I , because they were using their own anatomy , '' he said .
The genital teaching associate programs evolved with the standardized patient programs , which now exist in 83 of the nation 's 126 medical schools , according to Ms. Gliva-McConvey , up from 69 programs in 1991 - 92 .
Exact figures are not available on the number of genital teaching associate programs , but anecdotal reports indicate a strong presence .
At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock , for example , both programs have grown significantly , said Mary Cantrell , who was an actress and a standardized patient before become director of the school 's clinical skills center .
In 1993 , the school had one standardized patient .
Today , it has more than 200 , including 30 genital teaching associates .
`` The impact it has on students and the amount of doctor time it saves is amazing , '' she said .
`` These medical students can end up doing a better exam than a practicing nurse or physician . ''

Even after years with the books and the lectures , many medical students admit they are hardly prepared for their first genital exam .
When confronted with their first naked patient they have been known to faint , cry , vomit , become hysterical and sweat .
If they don n't overcome those reactions while working with an associate , they could experience them with an actual patient .
`` All a student 's folkways , all their traditions are being challenged , '' said Cathey Bienkowski , who has coordinated associate programs in the New York City area since 1982 .
`` We are what we have been brought up to be .
We all have certain values about nudity and touching .
The whole class is set up to be safe for the student . ''
Added Josie Hasle , a retired associate who set up the program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey at Newark : `` It 's such an invasive exam .
And everyone who walks through the door has baggage .
We help them move it from the personal to the clinical . ''
Beginning at Louisiana State University , she since has managed the programs at Tulane , campuses of the University of Texas , the University of Alabama and the State University of New York , among others .
With the associates , she said , `` The student gets a nonthreatening teaching environment . ''
Dr. Mark Swartz , director of the Morchand Center for Clinical Competence at Mount Sinai School of Medicine , where students from six New York medical schools practice clinical skills , said that the reluctance of doctors to perform routine pelvic examinations needs to be addressed .
`` If you compare the average 25-year-old medical student to the 25-year-old in public relations , '' he said , `` they are very immature .
Medical students have had much more of a sheltered social background than non-medical students .
From college they 've been so directed toward their career that , in many cases , their social development has been less , and with fewer interactions .
They could be very good at science but they haven n't begun to pass interpersonal skills 101 . ''
That makes such programs even more necessary , said Dr. Lila Wallis , a past president of the American Medical Women 's Association and founder of Cornell University 's associate program .
`` It is every woman 's right to have a painless , competent , sensitive and communicative exam , '' she said .
`` A woman with an unpleasant one in her past means that she won n't go for check-ups and jeopardizes her health . ''
Dr. Wallis , an internist , is particularly incensed with doctors who do not perform them .
`` A breast and pelvic is just as integral to the exam of a woman as an exam of the mouth , throat , lungs , heart , abdomen and extremities is .
Everything is intertwined in the body .
To separate it out is diagnostically invalid . ''
Although the associate programs work in different ways , depending on the school , the model that Ms. Saltzman follows is among the most sophisticated .
Male and female associates work with small groups of four or five medical students , residents or practicing doctors enrolled in continuing education programs .
Women work in teams of two , first demonstrating an ideal doctor-patient interaction , beginning with a knock at the examination room door , through the initial handshake and on through the actual examination .
Next , the medical students themselves follow the process , from the door through the examination .
Ms. Saltzman and her fellow associates are mostly part-time workers .
They are often people who are used to being looked at in their other jobs _ as actors , dancers and models .
They are well-trained as associates , and apprenticed .
In a way , they 've donated their live bodies to science , for an hourly fee .
In New York City , women typically receive $ 175 for a three-hour session , and men usually make $ 150 for two hours .
Some , like Ms. Saltzman , work more than a dozen of the three-hour sessions each year .
Male associates function more as live models as a urologist guides the sessions , though the men do interact with the students by answering questions and explaining what is comfortable and what is not during the genital and rectal exams .
Not everyone can do it , said Robert Speller , an associate for 12 years .
`` Nude , and nude and examined are very different , '' he said .
For some associates , including Ms. Saltzman , the work brings in more than money .
Last month , she said , she taught a medical student who had never had a pelvic exam herself , and by the end of the session , the student was ready to make an appointment .
Tracey Wang , 23 , a second-year medical student , was impressed as well .
After a December session of pelvic and breast examinations at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx , Ms. Wang said with a mixture of relief and confidence , `` I thought it would be uncomfortable to be instructed from that position , but now I don n't see a better way of doing it . ''
Dr. Paula Stillman of the Lehigh Valley Health System in Pennsylvania agreed .
`` When I went to medical school , we made the same mistakes over and over again , '' said Dr. Stillman , who has worked with associates since the 1970s .
`` Even a lot of experienced physicians may not have felt an ovary .
When you watch someone doing a pelvic you can n't tell what they 're feeling .
The only way you can really tell is if the person you 're doing the exam on can tell you . ''
