` THE EVERLASTING STORY OF NORY ' : LIFE OF A CHILD , MINUTE BY DETAILED MINUTE
( Eds : Publication notes at end of review . ) ( lb ) By MICHIKO KAKUTANI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
In his delightfully quirky first novel , `` The Mezzanine '' ( 1988 ) , Nicholson Baker hinted that his love of detail and obsession with minutiae stemmed from his vivid , tactile memories of childhood : `` Will the time ever come , '' he wondered , `` when I am not so completely dependent on thoughts I first had in childhood to furnish the feedstock for my comparisons and analogies and sense of the parallel rhythms of microhistory ?
Will I reach a point where there will be a good chance , I mean more than 50 - 50 chance , that any random idea popping back into the foreground of my consciousness will be an idea that first came to me when I was an adult , rather than one I had repeatedly as a child ? ''
Given Baker 's superawareness of his childhood , it 's not surprising that his latest novel , `` The Everlasting Story of Nory , '' should take the form of a 9-year-old 's story of `` the absolute best year of her life . ''
As usual , Baker focuses his novel on `` little snibbets of the day . ''
His first two novels took adult minutiae and extrapolated them into entire books : `` The Mezzanine '' chronicled a man 's lunch hour in which he buys a new pair of shoelaces , a cookie and a small container of milk ; `` Room Temperature '' described a young father giving his infant daughter a bottle .
`` Nory '' deals with similarly momentous issues in the life of a fourth-grader , like the pros and cons of admitting that you like Barbie dolls , the difficulty of getting the right amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush and the problems of lending someone your pencil box at school .
The results of trying to write an entire book about the `` dozens and hundreds of little tiny things '' that happen to a 9-year-old are decidedly mixed .
Although the book once again showcases Baker 's gift for microscopically detailed observation , its heroine is so young , so naked of emotional history that her daily routines don n't trigger the sort of engaging philosophical musings and stream-of-consciousness reminiscences that fleshed out the grown-up hero 's day in `` The Mezzanine . ''
Instead , the reader is left with a thin , highly predictable narrative about a schoolgirl 's banal _ and uneventful _ life : getting up , getting dressed , going to school , making friends , squabbling with friends , going on outings with parents , going to sleep , having dreams and nightmares , getting up the next day .
Though there are moments of funny , unnerving verisimilitude that recapture exactly what it felt like to be 9 , these moments are sandwiched between pages and pages of stultifying talk about matters like orthodontics and arithmetic .
To make matters worse , the character Nory often seems like a deliberate effort on Baker 's part to create an antithesis to Arno Strine , the obnoxious hero of his 1994 novel `` The Fermata '' : Where Arno was hypocritical , Nory is sincere ; where Arno was selfish , Nory is selfless ; where Arno was manipulative and self-deluding , Nory is innocent and sweet .
Neither of these black-and-white personality types makes for a terribly complicated _ or interesting _ character , and in this case , Nory 's willful niceness can become irritating and cloying .
She is constantly talking about the golden rule and the fairness of this or that .
She worries about ladybugs ' eating aphids and mongooses ' eating snakes .
She is the one girl at school to stick up for the school pariah , and the one girl to tell the teachers about the school bullies .
What keeps Nory from becoming a complete goody-goody is her keen and unrelenting sense of logic .
Nory wonders why so many cathedrals are designed in the shape of a crucifix , why `` they have to concentrate on the awful way he died . ''
( STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
On hearing the myth of Achilles , she wonders why his mother held him by the heels to dip him in the River Styx , why she hadn n't climbed in the river herself and gently cradled him in the water .
On hearing the old homily about `` the straw that broke the camel 's back , '' she wonders why the camel didn n't fold its knees and sit down in the sand before its back gave out .
In such passages , Baker demonstrates an innate understanding of the clarity and common sense that bright children so often possess , and he uses this instinctive knowledge to imbue Nory 's story with a sprightly , eccentric humor .
Other passages in the novel , however , have the labored , self-conscious smell of a grown-up trying too hard to impersonate a child .
When Nory is hit by some bird droppings , she exclaims : `` A disgusting bird took its leisure on me ! ''
And when she sees a bank 's corporate sponsorship logo at the local cathedral , she worries that it will make people think about cash machines , instead of the Virgin Mary 's love for her son .
Nory 's stories _ and she turns out to be an inveterate storyteller who 's constantly regaling her stuffed animals with tales _ also reverberate with suspiciously grown-up ideas : that children are obsessed with Grimm Brother-esque violence and terror ; that children are conscious of the therapeutic rewards of art ( of making order out of chaos , happy endings out of sad ones ) .
Nory prattles on about the morals of stories , and concocts her own rules for storytelling like `` You really need something to fail in a story , because then when it fails it has to get better . ''
It 's a bit of very adult advice that Baker , himself , should have listened to in writing this plotless and all too often listless novel .
