Canada Shuts Door on Criminals
OTTAWA , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Canadian immigration officials have barred about 1,000 known or suspected Russian mobsters and Asian underworld members from entering the country over the last four years , the National Post newspaper reported Saturday .
Canada Immigration 's Organized Crime Division has developed a databank containing names and aliases of 7,000 suspected criminals , and their family members .
To keep out the unwanted , officials act on a little-known section of the Immigration Act that allows them to deny a person 's entry into Canada if they have " reasonable grounds " to suspect that the applicants are connected to crimes .
Canadian police point out that organized crime is already a big social problem in Canada costing the country more than one billion Canadian dollars ( 0.65 billion U.S. dollars ) a year in fraud and theft alone .
About 200,000 immigrants enter Canada each year .
