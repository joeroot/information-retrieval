Indian Winter Session of Parliament with Stormy Start
NEW DELHI , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The winter session of Parliament which began here Monday was forced to be adjourned as soon as it started in a storm .
Members of some Opposition parties stalled the proceedings in the Lower House of Parliament demanding resignation of the Vajpayee government , which was held responsible for the defeat of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) in the just concluded four-State Assembly elections .
Leader of the Opposition Sharad Pawar , a senior leader from the Congress , the biggest Opposition in the House , demanded that the question hour be suspended and the House should discuss the issue of spiraling price rise .
As Pawar was on his legs , some other Opposition members rushed into the well of the House shouting , the prime minister must resign .
At the same time , non-Congress Opposition in the Upper House of Parliament Monday also demanded resignation of the Vajpayee government for its utter failure to control prices in the country .
The Congress charged the government with mismanagement pushing the country 's economy to the brink of collapse .
Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House Manmohan Singh said that alarming price situation was a reflection of gross mismanagement of the economy and that the government was lax to the point of criminality .
The Communist Party of India member Gurudas Dasgupta said that the Vajpayee government should resign forthwith before greater disaster strikes the economy as unabated price rise was due to total mismanagement and collapse of the government .
The speaker repeatedly requested the members to take their seats and allow taking up of the question hour .
Later on he was forced to adjourn the House till Monday afternoon as the members refused to leave the well .
