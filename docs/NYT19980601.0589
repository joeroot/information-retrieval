REASONS FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT A DUMP
( See NY-GOLF-COURSE ) ( ja ) By CLIFTON BROWN c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ Jack Nicklaus has designed golf courses in the desert , on tropical islands and in remote wooded areas .
But building a golf course on a Bronx garbage heap should rank as one of his most creative projects .
Nicklaus ' company has released only a preliminary sketch of a design for the course , to be built on 175 marshy and undeveloped acres in Ferry Point Park .
It is hard to predict what sort of course golfers should expect , because Nicklaus prides himself on variety , and the characteristics and terrain of a site go a long way toward determining what kind of course he creates .
But there is certainly reason to be optimistic about the quality of the layout .
The list of courses that Nicklaus has designed , either as the project chief or as a consultant , is impressive .
Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin , Ohio , the sight of the Memorial Tournament that was won by Fred Couples on Sunday , is regarded as one of the world 's finest courses .
While Muirfield may be Nicklaus ' best work , his other acclaimed courses include Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville , Ontario ; Annandale Golf Club in Madison , Miss. ; Castle Pines Golf Club in Castle Rock , Colo. , and Grand Cypress in Orlando .
All of these have hosted PGA Tour or Senior Tour events .
In his book `` Jack Nicklaus , My Story , '' Nicklaus laid out some general guidelines for what he called a `` well-balanced golf course . ''
For example , he said , a course should have one long par-five hole _ where even the best players would have trouble reaching the green in two shots _ one `` definitely reachable '' par-five hole , and two others par-fives that would be reachable depending upon weather conditions .
He said he sought similar variety in the par-three holes , and added , `` Ideally , they should go in different directions to vary the wind factor . ''
He also noted that he liked to include water hazards on about a third of the holes .
`` The thing I take the greatest pride in as a designer is honesty _ not tricking up holes , trying to keep everything out in the open , '' Nicklaus wrote .
`` I don n't want to play with the golfer 's mind , just make him or her use it fully . ''
