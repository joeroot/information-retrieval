Price of Color TV Picture Tubes Picks Up in China
CHANGSHA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The declining price of China 's color TV picture tubes began to pick up in October for the first time in 30 months , thanks to the state 's anti-smuggling drive and its policy of stimulating domestic demand .
Chen Zhangqing , director of Hunan Province 's electronics industry bureau , said that the anti-smuggling campaign stopped millions of illegal picture tubes from entering the Chinese market , thus helping restore the tube prices .
He also attributed the price rise to a booming rural market in household electric appliances in the wake of reconstruction in the flood-damaged areas .
The price of a 21-inch color TV picture tube , which had fallen as low as 460 yuan this summer , increased to more than 500 yuan early this month , while that of the 25-inch tube increased from 760 yuan to more than 800 yuan , according to China 's major picture tube manufacturers .
Since March 1996 , the price of the picture tubes had been declining as color TV manufacturers cut the prices of TV sets to promote sales .
The 21-inch tube , sold at 980 yuan at that time , also underwent continuous price cuts , and the price reached bottom this summer .
Experts say that the color TV picture tube industry still needs overhauling in spite of the rising prices , and have called for a readjustment of product mix .
