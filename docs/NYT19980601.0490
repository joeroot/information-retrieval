INDONESIA , IN DRAMA 'S GRIP , WARILY AWAITS FINALE

JAKARTA , Indonesia _ Suddenly , after decades of repression , Indonesia feels like a country without rules _ and that , for many people here , is as frightening as it is exhilarating .
Political prisoners are being freed .
The once tightly controlled press has slipped its leash .
Students are holding sit-ins in provincial government buildings .
People are speaking their minds .
These things were almost unheard of under President Suharto , who stepped down nearly two weeks ago after running Indonesia for 32 years as if it were his kingdom .
Already since his departure , a new Indonesia is in the making , but its shape is unknown .
`` Everything is in flux , '' said Goenawan Mohamad , the editor of the magazine Tempo , which was shut down by the government in 1994 but now plans to reopen .
`` Things can change tomorrow in a moment . ''
He added , `` This could be a short breath of freedom after the emperor is deposed . ''
For now , new political parties are being formed nearly every day .
The aggressive military has returned to its barracks and is publicly investigating its own wrongdoings .
And the attorney general has announced that he will investigate some of the immense wealth the former president amassed through businesses and charity foundations .
But there is little rejoicing here .
It was not simply personal ambition that led Suharto to clamp down so hard for so long ; it was a fear , shared by many in this country of 210 million people , of chaos .
The struggle to fill the place left by Suharto is only beginning , and unpredictable forces _ the military , popular and religious movements , new political parties and opposition leaders _ are testing their strength .
Throughout the last week , rumors of coups and of conflicts within the military have swept through the capital .
In the background , the economy of the world 's fourth-most-populous nation is collapsing at an accelerating rate .
Indonesia has entered a period of epochal change at a time when its people are becoming poorer , hungrier and more angry .
Dissatisfaction from the economic crisis was the prime engine behind Suharto 's ouster , leading to riots and weeks of student protests .
Pulling the country out of that economic tailspin has been left to his successor , B.J. Habibie .
But social unrest in the coming months could again send the country into turmoil .
One response to unrest could be reimposition of strongman rule .
`` The forces of repression are still lurking . ''
Mohamad said .
`` When you live with people with guns , you have to have institutions to defend you , and we don n't have that yet . ''
Successive generations of potential leaders were quashed by Suharto 's autocracy .
Now the many sectors he suppressed have begun to emerge and marshal their forces .
Labor activists , leftist ideologues , Muslim supremacists , democratic reformers , human rights campaigners , regional separatist movements , those still loyal to Sukarno , the president ousted in 1967 , and ambitious men and women who were forced in the past to pledge allegiance to Suharto have all been unleashed to pursue their own agendas .
`` Now you have 1,000 alternatives , '' said Wimar Witoelar , a political commentator .
`` Everyone is confused .
Everyone knows that the status quo is not going to last very long .
So everyone is grabbing for what they can get .
It 's a classic power vacuum and you have all kinds of whirlpools swirling around .
It 's very , very dangerous . ''

Among the dangers is a resurgence of ethnic and religious conflict in this nation of 13,000 islands , hundreds of ethnic groups and a history of conflict between the overwhelming majority of Muslims and minority groups of Christians and ethnic Chinese .
Many ethnic Chinese merchants remain afraid to reopen their shops after three days of rioting last month that damaged thousands of buildings and cost at least 500 lives in Jakarta alone .
Smaller outbreaks of rioting and looting have erupted elsewhere in the country since .
As dark fears and conspiracy theories stalk the capital , some even whisper that Suharto , who remains in Jakarta with his powerful family , may be acting as a `` puppeteer '' behind the scenes .
`` Be on alert because that factor could lead to a rift during the transition period , '' warned Marie Muhammad , who was Suharto 's last finance minister , last week .
If the country 's new openness and its struggle for political power degenerate into turmoil , and if its people slip further into poverty , many Indonesians might welcome a seizure of power by the military , the one institution that is seen by most people as organized and efficient .
The military formed the base of Suharto 's rule and remains the most potent power behind the scenes .
In the night-long shadow-puppet plays called wayang that form the heart of Javanese culture , the final battle comes at dawn , and people are warning that the sun has not yet risen here .
H. Roeslan Abdulgani , one of the wise old men of Indonesian politics , described this moment of confusion , uncertainty and infighting .
`` In Javanese wayang language , the spectators say the following , '' he wrote this week in a widely published newspaper column .
`` To see a wayang play without a story .
`` The puppeteer is invisible .
`` The musicians and singers are busy fighting over the offered food .
`` The onlookers are desperate .
`` They pray the dawn may soon come . ''
In an interview , Abdulgani , a former foreign minister who is now in his 80s , said the second round of the battle for the country 's future was only beginning .
He said that the first round was won by the pro-reform forces _ the students and the pro-democracy idealists _ but that they had yet to consolidate their victory .
`` Now is the moment of retreat for the status-quo forces , '' he said .
`` The commanders of the army of the king are still there , and today they are shouting , ` Pro-reform ! ' But be careful .
When will it end , the second round ? ''
