JORDAN GOT BY WITH HELP FROM FRIENDS
COLUMN-BOS ( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By BOB RYAN c.1998 The Boston Globe
CHICAGO _ Ladies and gentlemen : May we present `` The Jordanaires , featuring Michael Jordan . ''
This wasn n't one of those `` MICHAEL JORDAN and someotherguys '' affairs .
This was one of the hard-est games Michael Jordan ever has had to play .
He will be getting on a plane for Salt Lake City Tuesday only because members of what he long ago referred to as his `` supporting cast '' picked him up on a night when he was exceedingly mortal with a basketball in his hands .
In the midst of Chicago 's 88 - 83 Game 7 victory over the Indiana Pacers , he did flirt with a triple-double ( 28 points , 9 rebounds , 8 assists ) .
He did put the flypaper defense on Reggie Miller in the fourth quarter , limiting the Indiana Stickman to one field goal attempt .
Once you got past his 9-for-25 shooting , the fact that Jordan only made one jump shot in the entire second half , and the fact that he was uncharacteristically pedestrian at the free-throw line ( 10 for 15 ) , he did other things to help his team win the game , things that offer testimony to his true greatness .
`` What you saw is why he 's the best player in the league , and why he 's the best player ever , '' said Indiana coach Larry Bird .
`` I know that when my shooting was off I tried to get on the boards and make passes .
That 's what he did , and at the end of the game he just put his head down and tried to get to the foul line .
He understood that he needed to find another way for his team to win . ''
True enough , but none of this would have been enough .
Jordan 's season would be over right now if it weren n't for the contributions of a Croatian , a little blond guard , a graceful Arkansas guy who couldn n't even get a college scholarship coming out of high school , a veteran multi-purpose do-the-dirty-work guard who had entered the NBA billed as a pseudo-Michael , and an almost-forgotten backup forward who basically had watched the action for six games until he was called upon in the most important game of the year .
If there was any doubt that the Bulls really are a basketball team , and not just an excuse for Jordan to play basketball in a formal setting , they were eliminated Sunday night .
If you had just dropped in from Uranus , you wouldn n't have realized you were looking at the greatest player of all-time .
You could only appreciate what Jordan did to distinguish himself if you were a reasonably advanced scholar of the game .
But the Uranus resident would have watched the third period and said , `` Hey , that tall guy with the goatee really can throw that round thing through the orange ring . ''
It wouldn n't have taken much basketball sophistication to notice that in the third period Toni Kukoc drilled five baskets in five attempts , three of them murderous 3-pointers .
It didn n't seem to matter whether he was open or shooting with a hand massaging his whiskers .
He was , as they say , in the zone .
Before and after the Kukoc explosion this interplanetary visitor also would have noticed three great 3-point shots by Steve Kerr , each a major dagger in the Indiana heart .
The first came in the middle of a Chicago comeback run , pulling the Bulls within 28 - 26 after they had trailed by as many as 13 ( 20 - 7 ) .
The second made the score 36 - 32 .
The third was real-l-l-l-ly big , tying the score at 77 with 6 : 11 left .
Our friend also might have noticed the relentless hustle of Central Arkansas ' Scottie Pippen , who , like Jordan , struggled from the floor ( 6 for 18 ) , but who transferred his interest and energy to every other phase of the game .
Pippen was the game 's leading rebounder with 12 , half of which came on the offensive boards , where the Bulls annihilated Indiana , 22 - 4 ( good for a 24 - 6 second-chance point advantage ) .
He might have seen the big defensive plays submitted by Ron Harper , who came into the league as a minor league Jordan and who now must content himself with a shot every seven minutes _ if he drinks his milk to the bottom of the glass and remembers to say please .
But Harper always is ready to make a play , and he made a huge one when he tipped and caught a Mark Jackson entry pass intended for Rik Smits with 1 : 20 remaining and the Pacers down 4 ( 87 - 83 ) , with the ball .
Finally , it is doubtful the space visitor would have noticed Jud Buechler , but Phil Jackson certainly did .
On a night when both teams were in severe foul trouble _ there were 63 personals and at one point late in the game six of the 10 men on the floor had five fouls _ Jackson had to go deep enough into his bench to summon Buechler , who had been a series-long MIA candidate .
Buechler gave the Bulls five rebounds in 11 minutes .
Jordan remains the best player in basketball because he is the most well-rounded and resourceful player , but he is now fallible .
After Game 4 , everyone said , `` Ooh , Michael will be good for 35 to 40 in Game 5 _ easy . ''
It didn n't happen .
The same was said after Game 6.
It didn n't happen .
And who among us expected anything less than a virtuoso scoring performance in Game 7 ?
That didn n't happen , either .
The breakout scoring game never came .
We got something else .
We got to see how a smart player reads a situation and makes adjustments .
Michael 's Game 7 was something the late-career Bird could relate to .
It was a game the late-career Magic could relate to .
It was probably not a game the spoiled , star-struck United Center crowd could relate to .
But they 'd better get used to it .
Michael Jordan had to work very hard just to get through this series , and there is an even tougher confrontation in store when the Finals commence Wednesday night in Salt Lake City .
`` I learned in this series that I have to trust my bench more , '' said Jackson .
Athletic mortality is setting in .
The only way Michael Jordan is going to get a sixth ring is if the Jordanaires are good enough against the Jazz to help him get it .
