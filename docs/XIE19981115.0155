China Diamond Market Continues to Flourish
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Consumption of diamond jewelry in China has bucked the declining trend in much of the rest of Asia , according to today 's China Daily ( Business Weekly ) .
The paper quotes De Beers , whose sales of rough diamonds account for 75 percent of the world 's total , as saying that the growth of diamond jewelry sales in China continues to be well above average for Asia , reaching 8.5 percent in the first half of this year .
" China has a growing consumer market for diamond jewelry , which reflects the great growth of the economy , " said Philip Dobbs , China operations representative of De Beers , the largest diamond mining company in the world .
Dobbs said China had a flourishing cutting and polishing industry and an expanding diamond jewelry manufacturing industry .
The continuing recession in Japan and the Southeast Asian economic and currency turmoil have presented the diamond industry with considerable difficulties .
However , the retail value in China of diamond jewelry has been on the rise .
Sales by the De Beers Central Selling Organization stood at 451 million US dollars in the first half of this year , increasing by a wide margin from 1996 .
The average price per piece has also risen -- to 565 U.S. dollars last year .
" We are optimistic about the long-term prospects of the emerging market in China , " said Joan Braune , regional director of the corporate communications department of De Beers .
