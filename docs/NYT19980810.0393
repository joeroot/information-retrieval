SHARES CONTINUE TO RETREAT AS INVESTORS LOSE DIRECTION
( ATTN : Md. ) ( js ) By SHARON R. KING c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ Investors seemed to be asking , `` Where do we go from here ? ''
as they warily eyed the stock market in the wake of last week 's rout .
Since last Tuesday 's 299.43-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average , most market pundits have called for a continued downdraft near term , before the market again picks up steam .
Forecasts of earnings growth in the third quarter were quickly ratcheted lower ; analysts now see earnings for companies in the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's index of 500 stocks growing 6.4 percent this year , down from the 15.1 percent forecast on Jan. 1.
Now investors seem to be taking a defensive stance .
`` There are no heroes , '' said Charles Johnson , head equity trader at Blaylock & AMP ; Partners in Baltimore .
`` No one wants to be the first one out there .
People are not quite sure what 's going on , so they 're waiting for someone else to give them direction . ''
A rally among small-company shares , which rose smartly late last week , faltered on Monday , leaving the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks closing lower than it had a week earlier .
The Russell fell 4.16 points , to 411.64 , a 1 percent decline .
Drug company shares rose , helping stem further declines among larger-company stocks .
Investors bought shares of Merck , Warner Lambert and Schering-Plough , as they sought a haven from continued Asian weakness .
Some fear that Japan 's woes could force China to devalue its currency .
Analysts said the purchases should help the health care sector , down 8.9 percent since July 17 , rebound soon .
While domestic equity markets were little changed , prices fell in Asia , Latin America and Europe .
In the recent market rout _ from the highs on July 17 through last Friday _ financial stocks were the worst performers among the 11 sectors that make up the S&AMP ; P 500 , down 12 percent , and they fell again on Monday , largely because of exposure to Asia .
JP Morgan fell 3 5 / 16 , to 120 3 / 16 , accounting for more than half the decline in the Dow industrials , which fell 23.17 points , to 8 , 574.85 .
The S&AMP ; P 500 lost 6.31 , to 1 , 083.14 .
The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.56 , closing at 1 , 839.21 .
Despite those declines , a number of analysts are optimistic that financial shares will soon resume their place as stellar performers .
Tom Galvin , chief investment officer at Donaldson , Lufkin & AMP ; Jenrette , said brokerage-firm stocks might have been hurt by the decline in initial public offerings and a lack of investor confidence in the market .
He foresees no recession , however , and predicts that the environment of low inflation will be good for financials , retailers and home builders .
`` We think this is a buying opportunity , '' said Raphael Soifer , financial services analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman .
Although , he said , financial stocks would probably be volatile near term , `` when the market turns up , we expect them to lead . ''

Longer term , he likes Citicorp , Chase Manhattan , Bankers Trust , Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Lehman Brothers .
Mike Farrell , a quantitative analyst with Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford , predicts that savings and loans will continue to falter , as low interest rates increase the risk that borrowers will prepay mortgages .
In the next six to 12 months , Galvin believes that financials , health care , and technology stocks will resume their roles as market leaders .
Since July 17 , health care stocks have fallen 8.9 percent .
Managed-care companies will continue to be under pressure because of the Medicare reimbursement process , Galvin added .
Although recent stock market declines scuttled United Healthcare 's planned purchase of its rival , Humana , consolidations in the industry are likely to continue , he said , because few managed-care programs have been very cost effective .
While technology companies were toppled early by Asia 's malaise , they have been one of the better performing sectors in the S&AMP ; P 500 since the July highs _ down just 5.2 percent .
Stocks like Compaq , Intel and Motorola , which declined as much as 25 percent in the second quarter , should reverse those declines , as inventories shrink and seasonal demand for computers picks up , analysts said .
As a result , the outperformance of telephones and utilities , a defensive play , should be outlived .
The communication sector fell just 5 percent in the period .
