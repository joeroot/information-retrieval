Reform of Small State-Owned Enterprises Stressed
BEIJING , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- China will focus more closely on the reform of small state-owned enterprises , a State Economic and Trade Commission ( SETC ) official said here today .
Currently , 99 percent of China 's state-owned enterprises are small ones , generating about half of all output value and pre-tax profits and employing some 70 percent of workers in the state-owned sector .
Chen Bangzhu , vice-minister of the SETC , told a press conference this afternoon that the government will increase its support to small state-owned enterprises " to cultivate a new growth point . "
The policy of liberalizing small enterprises will remain unchanged , he said .
He noted that a lack of finances and technological innovation capabilities are two major problems affecting most small enterprises .
The SETC is planning to improve the loan guarantee system for small businesses and to set up regional technological centers for upgrading these enterprises .
The SETC is also considering setting up a guarantee fund for small businesses in the near future .
It has chosen Qingdao , Hefei and Liuzhou as pilot cities for technological innovation in small enterprises .
The People 's Bank of China and the SETC have both issued circulars on offering better financing to small enterprises .
Chen noted that related regulations will be released to prevent irrational practices in the reform of these enterprises , including indiscriminate selling of small enterprises and the erosion of state assets and bank obligations .
He pledged to create an environment conducive to fair competition among enterprises of various sizes and ownership structure .
