COMMENTARY : A SOLDIER OF CHRIST ON THE MARCH

NEW YORK _ When visited Monday in his corner office at the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , William Donohue was not burning books .
He was not chopping up reels of film into celluloid guitar picks .
He was not tossing videocassettes into the trash can .
That is because he is not a censor , no matter what some may say , Donohue said .
All he does as president of the Catholic League , he said , is raise warning flags whenever he believes someone has gone over the top in ridiculing Christian dogma or the Roman Catholic Church .
He just happens to be a particularly vigorous flag waver .
`` I believe in moral suasion , '' Donohue said at his normal decibel level , which is high .
`` I believe in whipping up public sentiment to isolate the offender .
I believe in putting on a lot of pressure . ''
He certainly has tried to do that in his latest crusade : to get the Manhattan Theater Club to cancel Terrence McNally 's new play , `` Corpus Christi , '' which was planned for the fall .
A recent draft shows that it is about a Jesus-like figure who has sex with his apostles and is crucified as `` king of the queers . ''
And you wonder if the Catholic League was offended ?
Of course , it protested .
Somebody went much further and threatened to bomb the theater club , which caved in and dropped the play , until it came to its senses on how to deal with would-be terrorists .
It canceled its cancellation .
On that score , it got no argument from Donohue .
If the police find `` the lunatic '' behind the bomb threat , `` they should put him in prison for a very long time , '' he said at the league 's offices at First Avenue and East 56th Street .
But that did not shake his conviction that `` Corpus Christi '' is an `` immoral '' play unworthy of being performed and that the Manhattan Theater Club is not entitled to its federal , state and local government subsidies .
It is one thing for a fully private group to produce such a work , he said , but `` nobody has a right to the public purse . ''
`` If it 's wrong to take public monies to promote my religion , then it 's wrong to take public monies to bash my religion , '' he said .
That goes to the heart of what Donohue has been about in the five years he has led the Catholic League , whose symbol is a sword and shield .
He is convinced that `` anti-Catholicism is the last respectable bias '' among those who view themselves as models of enlightenment .
Utter a word remotely offensive to Jews , blacks , women or gays ?
Heaven forbid .
Yet some of those same people do not blink before mocking the Church or Jesus or Catholic sacraments .
Imagine , Donohue said , `` a play called ` Shylock and Sambo , ' about gay Jewish slave masters who sodomize their obsequious black slaves . ''
You would not even have to protest a work like that , he said .
Its offensiveness to certain groups would be obvious .
No theater troupe would produce it in the first place , not in this city anyway .
Don n't Catholics , he asked , deserve the same consideration ?
Instead , his league has tracked one example after another of artists and writers depicting priests as pedophiles , nuns as sex-crazed witches and the pope as a man having sex with prostitutes .
Let 's not even get into images of Jesus on a cross of penises or Mary in a G-string .
For protesting such outrages , and aggressively , Donohue has received death threats of his own .
At a minimum , he is branded in some circles as an enemy of free expression .
Even among largely sympathetic Catholics , there are those who wish he would soften his style .
Donohue replies that Catholics are the aggrieved ones , especially `` Catholics like myself who openly proclaim the virtues of the church . ''
Returning to the McNally play , he said : `` A lot of people in the gay and the artistic community hate with a passion the Catholic Church , and they don n't want to admit to bigotry .
Bigotry is something in their mind which the Archie Bunkers of this world exercise . ''
If this play turns out not to be offensive , `` I 'll be the first guy to say I was wrong , '' Donohue said .
He paused before adding : `` But I would be very , very surprised if in fact I 'm going to have to make such a statement .
No , I think this is an in-your-face , stick-it-to-Catholics play .
They know exactly what they 're doing .
And they wouldn n't do it to any other segment of society . ''
