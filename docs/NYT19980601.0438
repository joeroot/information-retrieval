ANALYSIS : CLINTON STANCE AVOIDS HIGH-PROFILE CONFRONTATION
( ja ) By JOHN M. BRODER c.1998 N.Y .

WASHINGTON _ The dispute over executive privilege now embroiling President Clinton resonates with great legal and historical principles , pitting the sanctity of presidential communications against the majesty of the law .
But this clash of forces also boils down to more mundane matters _ the political calendar and the loyalty of Bruce Lindsey , the closed-mouthed guardian of the president 's most intimate secrets .
With its carefully-calibrated legal response Monday , the White House continued a strategy it has pursued throughout the serpentine Whitewater investigation : Challenge Kenneth Starr , the independent counsel directing the inquiry , at every turn and delay the completion of the investigation in hopes the public will lose interest over time .
This approach avoids a high-profile confrontation before the Supreme Court , with all the obvious reminders of the battle that finally doomed the presidency of Richard Nixon .
It gives the appearance of cooperation and compromise while slowing Starr 's inquiry and moving the case off the front pages .
If Starr is stymied in the courts , this reasoning goes , he will be forced to play out his hand in his report to the House of Representatives , a political forum where Clinton has numerous allies and where talk of impeachment over what the public sees as largely personal matters sends shivers down even Republican spines .
But Charles F.C .
Ruff , the White House counsel , said at a briefing for reporters that Monday 's legal filing was about constitutional imperatives and presidential prerogatives _ and nothing more .
`` There will undoubtedly be folks out there and in this room who suggest that this is part of a great scheme to delay , '' Ruff said .
`` That 's just nonsense . ''
Starr won an important victory last month with an order from a federal district court compelling the grand jury testimony of Lindsey and Sidney Blumenthal , a senior White House communications adviser .
The president Monday morning concurred with the recommendation of his legal advisers that he forego an appeal on Blumenthal .
The calculation appears to be that the president has little to fear from the testimony of Blumenthal , because he was not privy to the most sensitive of the president 's discussions on how to respond to accusations that Clinton carried on a sexual affair with a former White House intern , Monica Lewinsky , and then directed her to lie about it .
But the president is digging in his heels on Lindsey , asserting that lawyer-client privilege shields their conversations about how to handle the Lewinsky matter .
The appeals will likely take months to resolve , as Americans ' attentions turn to summer vacation and other distractions .
But even if the president ultimately loses and Lindsey is forced to testify , there is little expectation that Lindsey will become another John Dean and turn on the president .
Outside of the first lady , there is no one in the White House closer to the president and no one less likely to submit to pressure to reveal his secrets than Lindsey , a friend , confidant and shadow of Clinton for more than 30 years .
Lindsey has testified on numerous occasions in the Whitewater matter and other White House investigations and he retains the confidence of the president , White House officials noted .
This is not because he lied to protect Clinton , they added , but because he told the truth .
A senior White House official said Monday that the decision on the privilege appeal was `` made by lawyers based on the law and based on principles . ''
They insisted that the White House is seeking to preserve the president 's right to confidential advice from his closest aides _ not to bury illegalities beneath a mountain of legal paper .
The president 's political advisers played no part in the discussions that led to the legal pleading filed with the Supreme Court late Monday afternoon , several White House aides said .
But that assertion belies the political nature of the president 's legal team and the role that the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton play in such decisions .
The central participants in the weekend 's discussion were Ruff , David Kendall , the president 's personal attorney , W. Neil Eggleston , an outside expert on executive privilege claims , and Mickey Kantor , a longtime friend of the Clintons and the manager of the president 's 1992 campaign .
All have been by the president 's side as he has confronted a range of accusations from perjury to financial fraud to personal misconduct .
None is a stranger to the capital 's political cross-currents and all are loyal Democrats .
But their deliberations this weekend , and the case they presented to the president in the Oval Office Monday morning , were not about political survival or partisan advantage , aides insisted .
`` Most of the concern I 've heard the president and Mr. Ruff raise with respect to this matter is an institutional concern that relates to this president and future presidents , '' said Michael McCurry , the White House spokesman .
