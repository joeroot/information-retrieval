UK Takes Cautious Stance on Iraq
LONDON , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The United Kingdom government took a cautious stance Saturday over Iraq 's latest clash with the United Nations weapons inspection team , noting it was awaiting reaction from the inspectors .
A Foreign Office spokesman said the government was waiting for more detailed comments from the U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) over Iraq 's objections to providing documents to the inspectors .
" We will reserve any substantive comment until then , " the spokesman said .
The British position echoed again that of the United States .
President Bill Clinton said Saturday that he wanted to make sure of the facts and that it was important not to overreact .
Last week , the United Kingdom and the United States called off air strikes against Baghdad after Iraq withdrew its decision not to cooperate with the inspectors who were seeking to disarm its chemical , biological and ballistic weapons .
But both Washington and London have pledged to strike Iraq without warning if Baghdad stops again its cooperation with the U.N. inspectors .
