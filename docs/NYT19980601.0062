& HT ; CIGNA to defend coverage decision in court after woman 's death & HT ; By Debra Jasper & HT ; c.
1998 Cox News Service
COLUMBUS , Ohio _ In 1995 , Patty Branham was told her colon cancer had spread to her liver .
Her doctors said the only treatment that would keep her alive was a surgery that would destroy tumors by freezing them .
But the 35-year-old woman never got the operation .
Branham 's managed-care health plan , CIGNA HealthCare of Ohio , refused to pay for the surgery , saying it was too `` experimental and investigational . ''
It took CIGNA a month to reach that decision and another month to review Branham 's appeal , which CIGNA rejected , even though its experts said the surgery was an accepted medical technique .
Branham 's tumors , meanwhile , doubled in size .
And four months after her initial request for coverage _ while still battling the insurance company _ she died .
Last month , the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Branham 's husband , Craig , has the right to sue CIGNA because a company clause requiring arbitation for disagreements was vague and therefore non-binding .
Justice Paul Pfeifer , who wrote the court 's majority opinion , said her ordeal is the very scenario that frightens so many Americans , who worry about whether their coverage will be enough to see them through a time of real trouble .
`` When a terribly sick person is denied treatment , there is a breakdown in the process that ought to concern us all , '' Pfeifer said .
The country `` seems to be taking a step backward in the way we make treatments and cures available to everyone . ''
Howard Drescher , a CIGNA spokesman , declined to comment on the case , saying only that it `` in no way reflects the philosophy or standard operating procedures at CIGNA . ''
But many Ohio legislators _ as well as officials in New York , California , Texas , Florida and North Carolina _ agree with Pfeifer .
They are pushing to change state laws to give patients more leverage when dealing with managed-care health plans .
In Ohio alone , three bills have been introduced that would , among other things , allow patients who have been denied necessary care the right to sue their managed-care company .
Opponents say such legislation will make insurers afraid to turn down requests for unnecessary tests or treatment , driving up costs and forcing employers to choose plans that offer fewer benefits .
That would defeat the purpose of managed-care systems , which were set up in response to escalating health care costs .
The right to sue `` may actually reduce access to affordable health care coverage , '' said Mary Yost , a spokeswoman for the Ohio Hospital Association .
But Ohio Rep. Jeff Jacobson ( R-Phillipsburg ) , who is sponsoring one of the bills , said patients like Patty Branham need more protection than current law provides .
The number of people in managed-care plans in Ohio has jumped from 1.7 million to 4.2 million in the last four years .
Those people are paying for insurance and it ought to be there when they need it , Jacobson said .
And if it isn n't , he said , they ought to be able to do something about it .
`` I have never seen any issue that provokes as much unanimous outrage as the idea that health insurance companies are turning down people 's needed and covered medical care just to save a few dollars , '' Jacobson said .
`` The mere fact that they could get sued for making bad medical decisions will maybe stop them from making those decisions . ''
Jacobson said the provisions in many HMO contracts that require disputes to be settled in arbitration instead of court are unfair , especially if they require a lengthy process which is difficult for sick patients to work through .
His bill would void such clauses .
Jacobson 's bill also would allow patients who 've been denied coverage to appeal the denial to an independent group of medical experts chosen by a state agency .
`` Right now , the same people who had a financial stake the first time coverage was denied get to decide whether to overrule themselves , '' Jacobson said .
`` There is something wrong with that . ''
Ohio Rep. Don Mottley ( R-West Carrollton ) , supports Jacobson 's bill and said that in order for health care plans to work for patients , states must create laws holding HMOs more responsible .
`` Today , the insurers have an incentive to say no to expensive treatment because they know they aren n't held to the same standard of accountability as doctors , '' Mottley said .
`` Right now , the incentives are all in the direction of denying care , when it should be the other way around . ''
Tim Maglione , director of legislative affairs for the Ohio Medical Association , agreed .
`` If a doctor makes a mistake , a doctor will be held accountable either through the state medical board or civil justice system .
If an HMO errs , it should be accountable as well . ''
While officials in Ohio and around the country say HMO reform is wildly popular , HMO organizations and business groups issue dire warnings if one of the civil-liability bills becomes law .
Such legislation comes down to the bottom line for employers , said Denise Wible , spokeswoman for the Ohio Chamber of Commerce .
`` Insurers are not going to eat that cost ( of increased liability ) .
Who gets socked with it ?
It 's the employer and ultimately the employee that pays the price . ''
She said employers are also worried about their own liability under the proposed bills .
Language to exempt employers from being sued for choosing a particular insurance company is too vague , she said .
`` Courts will end up making the decisions and , frankly , courts are not traditionally friendly to business in cases like this , '' she said .
Wible said lawmakers are losing sight of the positive care health maintenance organizations provide .
`` While we 've all heard the stories about problems with HMOs _ and they are extremely painful to listen to _ a lot of folks out there have had wonderful experiences , '' she said .
Joe Gibbons , director of government relations for the Cleveland-based Medical Mutual of Ohio , said an Ohio law that becomes effective in November already tightens standards for HMOs .
The new law requires health plans to respond to claims involving life-threatening illnesses in three business days and gives insurers just four business days to make referrals to specialists .
The law also sets up specific standards that HMOs must follow in reviewing cases .
Gibbons predicted that going beyond those provisions and making HMOs civilly liable for not following careful procedures will cause them to practice `` defensive medicine . ''
Just as fear of lawsuits encourages doctors to order unnecessary tests and other treatments , so will HMOs , Gibbons said .
`` Then the hue and cry will start over costs . ''
Jacobson is skeptical of those claims .
He said insurance premiums are based on the company 's knowledge that it must pay for a certain number of surgeries and other treatments each year .
Services they decline to pay for can end up as extra profit , he said .
`` They say insurance costs will go up if we do this , '' Jacobson said .
`` Well , the fact is , costs will go up no matter what . ''
Tony Merry , a Columbus attorney representing Craig Branham , said his law firm has a growing number of clients who want to challenge HMO decisions .
People are getting fed up with the system , he said .
`` Everybody either has experienced or knows somebody who has experienced problems with HMOs and managed care , '' Merry said .
`` These HMOs make a lot of money .
They are making executives very , very rich and shareholders very , very wealthy by making a lot of decisions about health care based on cost . ''
Merry said Patty Branham 's surgery would have cost $ 80,000 to $ 100 , 000 , and laws should force insurers , when looking at such high costs , to consider whether it would be more expensive to deny coverage or to pay for it .
`` I have a lot of clients who find themselves having to devote as much time fighting the insurance company as they do fighting their illnesses , and that 's a tragedy , '' Merry said .
`` Insurance companies are not in the business of controlling health costs , they are in the business of making money .
So the only way to motivate an HMO to give people the care they need is to give them the threat of getting hit with a huge verdict . ''
That 's an argument Merry will no doubt make during Craig Branham 's trial against CIGNA , which is expected to start next month in Ross County , Ohio .
Branham , a 29-year-old prison guard , hopes the trial makes insurance companies think twice the next time they deny critical care .
He said his wife realized her cancer could always come back , but her tumors had begun to shrink and she had high hopes the surgery would destroy them .
`` It 's not fair that an HMO has the last word on a decision about coverage , especially when you 're talking about surgery in a life-threatening situation , '' Branham said .
`` To me , it was cruel , what they did to my wife .
I just hope some good comes out of it . ''
