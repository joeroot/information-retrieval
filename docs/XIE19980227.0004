China Adds Modern Definitions to " Lei Feng Spirit " ( 1 )
BEIJING , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Du Chunyan , a self-employed merchant from northeast China 's Heilongjiang Province , today walked into the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China 's Central Committee .
She was invited to speak to a small gathering of Party and government officials and the media people on the efforts she had made to become one of China 's model youths in learning from Lei Feng , the country 's top prototype of altruism .
Du , who was laid off in 1991 by a state enterprise on the verge of bankruptcy , opened a private store and learned to run it well with some kind people 's assistance .
After getting prosperous , she rewarded society by helping many other young laid-off workers to learn skills and find new jobs .
To Lei Feng , a soldier of the People 's Liberation Army living in the 1950s and 1960s , what happened in Du 's life would be nothing but strange and puzzling .
And he wouldn n't have the slightest idea of terms like " self-employed " , " laid-off workers " and " re-employment " , which , however , have almost become daily vocabulary for today 's Chinese people .
But officials in charge of China 's ethical and cultural progress today praised Du for having carried forward the essence of the lofty spirit of Lei Feng under the new system of a socialist market economy .
Since the late Chairman Mao Zedong wrote in 1963 an inscription urging the whole country to " Learn From Comrade Lei Feng " , the Chinese government has never stopped a nationwide campaign that prompts the people to embrace altruism and do good things for society .
As times change , the interpretation of the " Lei Feng Spirit " has also been continually enriched , and has now far exceeded the narrow scope of altruism .
