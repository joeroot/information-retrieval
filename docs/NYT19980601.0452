INDIA HIKES MILITARY , RESEARCH OUTLAYS ( JT )
By JOHN F. BURNS c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW DELHI , India _ Declaring that there can be `` no compromise on defense preparedness '' in the wake of the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan , the government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced Monday that it has approved large budget increases for the country 's armed forces , as well as for nuclear research and missile programs .
In their first budget , the Hindu nationalist leaders who head the country 's coalition government revealed that military outlays will go up by 14 percent , part of which will pay wage increases for India 's 1.6 million troops .
The budget increase is among the largest ever made by India in peacetime , and will push total military outlays to the equivalent of $ 12.4 billion , about 19 percent of total government outlays of $ 64.3 billion .
Indian economists estimate the total annual output of the Indian economy at about $ 265 billion .
The military increases were dwarfed by increases of 68 percent for the Atomic Energy Commission , in charge of civilian and military nuclear programs , and 62 percent for the Department of Space , which helps develop rockets that India has used to launch space satellites as well as military variants the Vajpayee government has said will be equipped with nuclear warheads .
Together , the outlays on nuclear and missile research will amount to $ 665 million , up $ 262 million from last year .
Yashwant Sinha , the finance minister , also announced large increases in spending on education , health , family welfare and development programs for women and children , the core of India 's efforts to relieve the dire poverty and illiteracy that afflict more than 350 million of its 980 million people .
But even with an increase of 35 percent , the total outlay for these programs , about $ 2.6 billion , was only fractionally more than the budget for military hardware , and about 20 percent of the overall defense outlay .
Many Indians were surprised that the budget appeared to have made no allowance for the economic sanctions the United States has imposed on India , as well as Pakistan , in the wake of the nuclear tests .
Sinha , who appeared to have made his plans on the basis of the tax revenues , investment flows and growth rates that were forecast before the nuclear blasts , predicted a doubling of foreign investment within two years , encouraged by new steps he announced to ease bureaucratic obstacles to new projects , and to sell off large chunks of some of the best-known state-controlled enterprises .
One of these will be Indian Airlines , the country 's troubled domestic air carrier .
Sinha said he was confident the sanctions would not `` have any significant impact on our economic development . ''
In any case , he said later , Indian officials calculate it will be 12 to 18 months before the sanctions begin to cut significantly into the flow of loans , investment , trade and aid .
But the finance minister appeared anxious to counter some of the harshest criticism the nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 have prompted in India .
While opinion polls continue to show approval ratings of 80 percent for the tests , newspaper editorials , speeches by opposition leaders and street protests have offered a different view _ that the Vajpayee government has betrayed the hopes of millions of India 's ill-nourished , illiterate and disease-prone citizens by committing the country to the vast costs of a nuclear arsenal .

Sinha , 60 , a former civil servant and diplomat who only recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party , the Hindu nationalist party that came to power 10 weeks ago at the head of a 14-party coalition , told Parliament that in drafting the budget he had used a moral standard set by Mohandas K. Gandhi , India 's independence leader .
`` I have recalled to myself the face of the poorest and weakest man I have seen and made sure that this budget is of use to him , '' he said .
Since India 's nuclear tests , senior officials in the Vajpayee government have said the country will mount nuclear warheads on a range of missiles that have been test-fired in recent years .
But Western diplomats said Monday that the budget increases , while steep , did not necessarily mean that India intended to proceed immediately with missile deployments , a step some Indian military analysts have said will cost at least $ 1 billion a year .
Sinha told reporters that once the government had take a firm decision on `` weaponization , '' he would return to Parliament for more money on top of the defense increases in the budget .
The diplomats said that the new outlays could be intended for stepped-up research on warheads and missiles , and for new missile tests that Indian scientists have already said are pending , with actual operational deployment still months or years away .
