McNALLY EPISODE RAISES TOUGH ISSUES By STEVEN WINN c.1998 , San Francisco Chronicle
Threats to burn down a theater , kill the staff and `` exterminate '' a playwright will get people 's attention every time .
Last week 's firestorm over the cancellation and subsequent reinstatement of Terrence McNally 's `` Corpus Christi '' at New York 's Manhattan Theater Club was felt strongly across the country .
The result was a heated exercise in spontaneous public discourse .
Ignorance played as big a role as passion in the `` Corpus Christi '' affair , which left the MTC scraping egg from its blushing face , turned the playwright into a unwitting hero of artistic freedom , and raised all sorts of fears that intimidation could be a successful strategy to influence what gets seen and what doesn n't on stage .
With the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights squared off against a squadron of outraged playwrights and the National Coalition Against Censorship , `` Corpus Christi '' was once and forever politicized .
Will anyone be able to see McNally 's play , once it gets on , without thinking of it as a theatrical equivalent to Robert Mapplethorpe 's photographs ?
Never mind what the play actually portrays or whether it succeeds artistically .
The play-that-got-banned label , inaccurate as it is , will both enhance and obscure its reception .
The unfinished play , according to those who have read a draft , deals with a modern-day Jesus figure named Joshua who is gay and has sex with his disciples .
`` I 'm not Jesus , '' the character points out .
`` I 'm Joshua . ''
Producer Jonathan Reinis of San Francisco 's Theatre on the Square , who 's read the play , terms it a comedy that `` could be very , very funny . ''
The Manhattan Theater Club , a vital off-Broadway house , pulled the show from its fall season May 21 , then reversed its decision a week later .
`` Corpus Christi '' will proceed , with security measures , although the opening date has not yet been set .
A Catholic group disavowed the threats of violence but strongly protested the play .
Tony Kushner , Wendy Wasserstein and a host of other big-gun playwrights decried MTC 's original decision to cancel the play .
Athol Fugard threatened to pull a forthcoming play from the MTC 's schedule .
Before the reinstatement , offers by Reinis , the Berkeley Repertory Theatre and the Eureka Theatre to produce the play in the Bay Area symbolized the theater community 's vigilance when it comes to freedom of expression .
`` You can n't let these people win , '' Berkeley Rep Artistic Director Tony Taccone said of those who issued the anonymous threats .
Taccone acknowledged that McNally 's play was not likely to premiere in Berkeley and even said the playwright wasn n't his `` cup of tea entirely , '' but he said the show of solidarity was important .
Of course , the to-do over the play wouldn n't have hurt at the box office .
The enduring irony about artistic protests in the modern world is that they 're often great publicity .
One striking aspect of the controversy was how little anyone on either side actually knew as events unfolded .
Few if any of the work 's opponents had read the play they vowed to shut down .
And until MTC artistic director Lynne Meadow held a press conference Thursday , no one charging the theater with `` censorship '' knew the details of the threats that led her to cancel the play .
`` It 's very easy for both sides to judge , '' said Carey Perloff , artistic director of the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco .
Perloff spoke from experience .
In 1992 , a group called Catholics for Truth and Justice lobbied hard against ACT 's production of Dario Fo 's `` The Pope and the Witch , '' which presented an irreverent portrait of the head of the Catholic church .
There were no death threats then , but the protesters struck hard at the lifeline of the company by trying to influence funders .
Perloff sympathized with both Meadow 's anguish and the reaction of those angered by the theater 's initial capitulation .
`` It 's an awful , awful situation , '' she said .
One lesson learned from `` The Pope and the Witch '' mess , she said , was clear .
`` The most important thing is to demysitfy the play .
The more we put the media beam on it and did symposia and answered phone calls , the less virulent the attacks became . ''
That didn n't happen with `` Corpus Christi . ''
The protests and threats , the cancellation , outrage and reversal , came in a blur .
Suspicion , second-guessing , rebukes and heavy rhetoric took over .
Taccone , speaking just after the decision to reinstate `` Corpus Christi '' was made , did find a bit of fatalist humor in the situation .
`` The play will probably open and get creamed by the critics , '' he said , `` and be a huge hit with the public . ''
