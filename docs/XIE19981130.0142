Australian Dollar Weaker Amid Rate Cut Speculation
CANBERRA , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The Australian dollar closed weaker Monday , as market expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) , the country 's central bank , could cut interest rates this week .
" Basically the currency is just slowly edging down on expectations that tomorrow or later in the week the RBA may well cut rates ( when the central bank board meets ) , " said Angelo Gangemi , foreign exchange manager of Bankers Trust Australia .
The local unit closed in Sydney Monday at 63.15 U.S. cents , from 63.58 U.S. cents previously , after marking a 63.14 to 63.45 U.S. cent band during the session .
Gangemi said volume had been light , but there had been a lot of speculative sellings during the past four trading sessions in anticipation of a RBA move on rates .
The RBA last cut rates on July 30 , 1997 , by 50 basis points to 5.00 percent .
Recently several overseas central banks , including the U.S. Federal Reserve , have eased monetary policy but the RBA has so far not responded .
On the cross rates the Australian dollar was buying 78.12 Japanese yen from 78.03 yen Friday and 1.0798 German marks from 1.0821 marks .
