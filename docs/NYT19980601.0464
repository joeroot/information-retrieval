RULEMAKERS APPROVE CHANGE UNPOPULAR WITH BANKS
( ja ) By MELODY PETERSEN c.1998 N.Y .

& UR ; & LR ; The nation 's accounting rulemakers said Monday that they had given final approval to a new rule that will force companies to record the value of derivatives in their financial statements .
The move was immediately criticized by the banking industry and other groups , who have complained so loudly in Washington about the proposed rule in recent months that a bill has been introduced to weaken the power of the private rule-making body , known as the Financial Accounting Standards Board .
Edmund Jenkins , the chairman of the accounting board , said that the new rule was needed to help protect investors in cases where companies may be investing heavily in derivatives that could result in huge losses .
He added that the intense criticism had made it even more important for the board to act .
Several years ago , the accounting board decided to weaken another proposed rule on the accounting of employee stock options after companies complained to Congress .
`` If the board had backed down on derivatives , I think it would have made it very difficult for the board to be an effective standard setter in the future , '' Jenkins said .
`` It is crucial that we have independent standard setting . ''
The seven members of the accounting board voted unanimously to approve the new rule during balloting that concluded late last week .
Derivatives are complicated financial contracts between two or more parties where the contract 's value is tied to an underlying asset or pre-existing index .
Companies use derivatives such as swaps and futures contracts to reduce the risk they face from fluctuating foreign currencies or interest rates .
The new rule will require companies to record the market value of the derivatives on their balance sheets and to include the gains or losses on those contracts in income .
Most companies must start using the rule in January 2000 _ a month that company executives are already worried about because of the potential havoc that the millenium date could have on computers .
Banks and other companies said that the accounting rule was not practical .
They said that companies already provided enough information on derivatives in notes that must be included with financial statements .
Last year , Alan Greenspan , the chairman of the federal Reserve , sided with the banks and urged the accounting board to refrain from dramatic rules changes .
Greenspan warned that the new rule could keep companies from using derivatives and could `` constrain prudent risk management practices . ''
But at times , companies have created more risk for themselves by entering the derivative contracts .
For example , Procter & AMP ; Gamble lost tens of millions of dollars in 1994 on derivative contracts that were tied to interest rates .
`` Unfortunately , there are some who have been trying to force the FASB to not issue this standard , preventing valuable information from reaching investors , '' Jenkins said .
`` We must avoid placing the interests of any particular group over the consumers ' interests . ''

All publicly held companies must follow the rules of the Financial Accounting Standards Board , a privately financed group based in Norwalk , Conn. The Securities and Exchange Commission can sanction any company that does not abide by the board 's rules .
Under a bill introduced by Rep. Richard Baker , R-La . , any accounting rule proposed by the accounting board would have to be approved by federal regulators at the SEC .
The bill by Baker would also make it easier for companies to challenge the new accounting rules in court .
Sen. Lauch Faircloth , R-N.C . , has introduced another bill that would exempt banks from using the new derivatives rule unless banking regulators give their approval .
In a statement Monday , the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , a group that includes banks and other companies , said the new rule was `` a flawed product adopted in a process that ignored widespread dissent . ''
But Jenkins said that the board had considered the comments by the banks and other companies during more than 140 meetings it had on the proposed rule .
In response to the comments , the board delayed the rule 's effective date by two years and agreed that companies ' meeting certain requirements will not have to include the changes in a derivative 's value in income .
The accounting board was created in 1972 as a private sector body , Jenkins said , to try to keep politics and the `` self-serving objectives of special interest groups '' out of the rulemaking process .
Many investor groups , government officials and companies have urged Congress not to change the process of setting the nation 's accounting rules , which are widely considered to be the strongest in the world .
