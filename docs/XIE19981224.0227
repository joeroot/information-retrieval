News Analysis : U.N. Faces Grave Challenge in Angola
UNITED NATIONS , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.N. Security Council Wednesday issued a presidential statement , repeating the accusation that " the primary responsibility for the failure to achieve peace in Angola clearly lies with the leadership " of the rebel UNITA , namely the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola .
The statement was issued as fighting is raging on in the battle-scarred southwest African country , which created 26 deaths and two dozen injuries in central Angola Wednesday .
" There is a war , " U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on December 14 , referring to the rapidly escalating bloodshed in the nation .
Against such a backdrop , Annan wondered aloud that whether the U.N. efforts to foster peace had come to an unsuccessful end .
" The ( Security ) Council soon will be obliged to decide whether the U.N. has a role or not , " he said .
In response to Annan 's latest report of grim assessment , the 15-member Security Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola ( MONUA ) until February 26 , 1999 .
The peace treaty that gave Angola , a country rich in diamond and oil deposits , its longest cease-fire in 30 years is in ruins .
Since June the UNITA rebel forces have retaken more than half the countryside , engaging the Angolan Army in hundreds of places and flushing more than 200,000 Angolans from their villages .
The most recent peace effort in Angola , the second attempt in this decade to bring an end to a long and brutal war , has already cost the United Nations more than 1 billion U.S. dollars , most of it in maintaining peacekeeping troops in the country .
Earlier this year , many thought it was almost complete and the United Nations was scaling down its presence in the African country .
However , grave challenges are still in store for the world body .
First , at present , there is little the MONUA can do to save the long-stalled peace process .
In the report to the Security Council , Annan said , " The overall political , military and security situation in the country has further deteriorated .
The dialogue between the Government and Mr. ( Jonas ) Savimbi ( the UNITA leader ) and his movement has ceased . "
The report said , " preparations for a military showdown continue .
As a result , MONUA is , in fact , unable to carry out most of its mandated tasks and the prospects for reactivating the peace process look bleak . "
Secondly , although the United Nations has a new representative in place , Issa Diallo , it is unclear whether the peace effort can be put back together again .
In September , the Angolan Government cut off all negotiations with Savimbi , and it has refused to let Diallo meet with him .
In this way , the U.N. representative , who resumed office in August , found it hard to kick off his mission in the country .
However , Diallo has said that there is hope because neither side has completely rejected the Lusaka Protocol , signed in 1994 to restore peace in the war-torn country .
Currently , he does not give up his hope and efforts to begin talks with all parties concerned .
In fact , he is trying hard to win the chance on the ground .
Thirdly , the Joint Commission failed to hold talks on the current situation in Angola .
" The joint mechanisms , including the Joint Commission , are not functioning , " Annan said .
The Joint Commission groups the United Nations , the Angolan Government , UNITA , the observer states of the Angolan peace process -- Portugal , Russia and the United States .
Annan , the first U.N. chief from the sub-Saharan Africa , attaches great importance to all kinds of efforts to end conflicts on the continent , home to a large number of the least developed countries .
However , the international community , including the United Nations , the Organization of African Unity and other regional groups , have never lost the hope in promoting the stalled peace process in the country , all singing in one voice that only political settlement , achieved on the basis of the various peace accords and relevant U.N. resolutions , can help introduce lasting peace into the country .
All these exterior assistance is necessary , of course .
But one of the key elements lies in painstaking efforts to enable the Angolan Government and UNITA to put aside their differences in the national interest , thus giving peace a chance .
