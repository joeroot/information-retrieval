Indonesian Police Call Bloody Clashes Provoked
JAKARTA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesian police said provocateurs incited students and the masses to attack security forces before the bloody clash in Jakarta last week .
In a nationwide televised address , National Police chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said the students were negotiating an end to last Friday 's protest with security personnel deployed to safeguard the special session of the People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) when the agitators appeared on the scene .
They began throwing stones , Molotov cocktails and dirt at the lines of security personnel and urged others to join in .
This led directly to the clashes between the security personnel and the protesters , the Jakarta Post Thursday quoted him as saying .
He said clashes on Thursday and Friday last week left 13 people dead , 89 hospitalized and 427 requiring medical treatment .
Those killed included four students and one member of the security forces .
Independent estimates put the death toll from the two days of violence at 15 people .
The police chief laid the blame for the riots on a group of opposition politicians who last week openly called for an alternative government .
He said this had incited the students and mobilized the masses .
The group met in the Sahid Jaya Hotel last Thursday to issue a declaration , which then received nationwide publicity .
" They had the motive and they made the initial move , " Roesmanhadi said , adding that police will continue to investigate the matter and are currently gathering more evidence and testimony .
Roesmanhadi said police would announce in a detailed and transparent manner the results of the investigations .
On Wednesday , the National Police continued to question seven of the 20 opposition figures accused of trying to topple President B.J. Habibie 's government .
The figures are charged with violating articles 107 and 110 of the Criminal Code on subversion , which carry maximum penalties of life imprisonment .
Meanwhile , the independent Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence ( Kontras ) asserted that the military was involved in provoking student protesters .
Talking to reporters on Wednesday , Kontras coordinator Munir said plainclothes and uniformed military personnel were " directly and indirectly involved . "
He said witnesses , including a number of unemployed people and Armed Forces personnel , have admitted that they had been assigned to incite unrest during the student protests .
Munir displayed a fake university jacket and a badge of the private Veteran University , worn by an alleged provocateur who was apprehended by students and the public .
Munir said there were also reports of intimidation against a number of victims who were still being treated at hospitals in Central Jakarta .
