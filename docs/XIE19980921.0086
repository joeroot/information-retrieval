Graduates Unemployment in Jordan Forces Government
AMMAN , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- A high unemployment rate of Jordan 's college graduates has awakened officials to urging the government to forge an equation between the graduates supply and market demands , the Jordan Times daily reported on Monday .
Some 16 percent of Jordan 's college graduates have no jobs while 50 percent of the unemployed are the graduates , Tayseer Nahar , an official National Center for Human Resources Development , was quoted by the paper as saying .
The unemployment problem is still worsening as the number of college students rises by an annual 9.2 percent on average , Nahar told a national conference on unemployment Sunday .
Nahar called on the government to find a way to solve the problem of oversupply of the highly-educated manpower .
He proposed the government improve vocational training , adjust high school curricula to enable students to adapt to market requirements and develop a comprehensive policy aimed at improving the quality of education .
The government may set up a better information system to help advance education and employment policies , and encourage higher education institutes and the production sectors to jointly run the education process , he added .
Jordan has 55 community colleges , six public and six private universities .
The annual number of the graduates far exceeds that of the job opportunities , which is estimated at 15 , 000 , the kingdom creates each year .
Official figures say that Jordan 's unemployment rate stands at 15 percent while independent statistics say the figure is 27 percent .
