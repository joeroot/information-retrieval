World Wheat Supply , Demand in 1997 - 98 : IGC
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- As a result of higher figures for Russia , Argentina , China and Australia , the estimate for world wheat production shows an increase of 5 million to a record 608 million tons in 1997 - 98 .
Trade is 1 million higher at 96 million tons , principally reflecting higher estimated imports by Algeria and Libya .
Forecast export shipments by Canada are up 0.5 million to 19.5 million tons , ther International Grains Council ( IGC ) announced here Thursday .
Following substantial revisions to supply-demand data for several countries , world consumption is estimated 9 million up on last year at 590 million tons .
The revised figure for stocks is 128 million , an increase of 17 million over 1996 - 97 , according to the IGC .
As far as coarse grains are concerned , production is 4 million higher at 897 million tons , some 10 million down on last season .
The main increases concern Europe , Russia and China , which offset reductions for Thailand and South Africa .
Consumption of coarse grains is forecast 6 million lower at 900 million tons .
Smaller domestic crops of maize will curtail use in Brazil and South Africa , and pasture conditions are especially favorable in Saudi Arabia , the IGC said .
Forecast stocks are up 10 million to 117 million tons .
The stock drawdown in China could be less severe than expected previously , the council added .
