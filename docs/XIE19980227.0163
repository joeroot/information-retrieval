Manila Searching for More Marcos Accounts
MANILA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos said Friday that the government is now in the process of searching for 60 more accounts of the late former president Ferdinand Marcos which are reportedly stashed in some foreign banks .
At a meeting of the Presidential Commission on Good Government , Ramos said it was believed that there are 60 more Marcos accounts in Switzerland , Hong Kong and New York , in addition to the 500 million U.S. dollars earlier discovered in two Swiss banks .
Ramos said he had directed the Philippine ambassador to Switzerland to send letters " to Swiss banks to inquire about the status of those accounts . "
He said the government will also make similar requests to other banks abroad , particularly in New York and Hong Kong where there are presumably Marcos accounts .
" If the existence of the accounts is confirmed and there is money left in them , then we will file a petition for the recovery of the money , " he said .
The Swiss Federal Supreme Court last month ordered the immediate transfer of the 500 million dollars in Marcos wealth deposited in two Swiss banks to the Philippine government .
Earlier , an investigating committee of the Philippine Senate said it had uncovered another 60 Marcos accounts kept in Switzerland , Hong Kong and New York .
Some of these accounts are in the name of foundations .
The Philippine government has been searching for Marcos ' hidden wealth since 1986 .
The Presidential Commission on Good Government has already recovered about 750 million dollars worth of Marcos assets , mostly in shares of stocks , real estate and art pieces .
Marcos was ousted in 1986 by a popular revolt and died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 .
The government has accused Marcos of looting billions of dollars from the economy during his 20-year rule .
