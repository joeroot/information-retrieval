Kenya Govt .
May Withdraw from National Bank
NAIROBI , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The Kenyan government could pull out of the troubled National Bank of Kenya ( NBK ) , and banking altogether , after resolving the crisis caused by panic withdrawals and huge bad debts owed by powerful individuals .
Even after the state paid 33.3 million U.S. Dollars two weeks ago to counter a run on NBK , it still requires an additional 50 million Dollars recommended by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the East African weekly reported Monday .
The IMF stressed that the Kenyan government should pump in more money to stabilize the bank and then the World Bank 's International Finance Corporation may help find a willing buyer for Kenyan government 's 22.5 percent stake in the bank .
The NBK , the fourth largest in this east African country , has accrued 8.4 billion Shillings ( 140 million Dollars ) of bad debts owed by parastatals and powerful individuals including two cabinet ministers and the deputy speaker .
The IMF proposals follow the recent collapse of five small private commercial banks and a run on the NBK by frightened depositors which took 26.6 million Dollars out of the bank 's reserves three weeks ago .
The Kenyan government also has shares in the Kenyan Commercial Bank and Consolidated Bank .
