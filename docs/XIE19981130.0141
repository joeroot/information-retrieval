This Year 's Hurricane Season Ends Monday , Say U.S. Scientists
LOS ANGELES , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- This year 's Atlantic hurricane starting June 1 winds up Monday after racking up the deadliest toll in more than 200 years , said a U.S. scientist Sunday .
The Atlantic season 's last gasp was Tropical Storm Nicole , which formed last week and expected to weaken as it was swept even farther north over cooler seas , said pioneering hurricane forecaster William Gray at Colarado State University .
With the gradual fading of the latest cycle of the El Nino phenomenon , which tends to suppress Atlantic hurricanes , 1998 saw 10 hurricanes and four tropical storms , Gray added .
He also said the Pacific hurricane season was about average with 13 named storms and nine hurricanes and will also end Monday .
The death toll from Mitch , the season 's monster , is estimated at more than 10 , 000 .
Explaining that the last four years have been the most active ever for hurricanes in the Atlantic basin , Gray warned more of the same hurricane season is possible next year .
" We are going to see the return of some of these types of storms , " he said .
" People have to face up to it .
The insurance industry has a major problem . "
