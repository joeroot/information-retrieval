JORDAN ERA SURVIVES AS BULLS OUTLAST PACERS

CHICAGO _ There were frayed edges on his greatness and dents in his mystique , but Michael Jordan did not care about appearances at this moment .
He dropped the finesse and elegant beauty of his game on Sunday night and barged in between the Pacers and their grasp on the Bulls ' dynasty like a bouncer .
It was evident in the last three tense minutes in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals played out before an unsettled crowd at the United Center .
There was the moment when Jordan tossed his tired body into the air and crashed into the chest of his series menace , Derrick McKey .
Jordan was the one left standing .
There was the instant that he sneaked inside of the brawny Dale Davis and grabbed a rebound off a missed free throw by Scottie Pippen .
A possession was saved .
This was not the polished Jordan , not when he made 9 of 25 shots on his way to 28 points , but there was the poise of the ultimate winner when face to face with a game that could have meant the end to the Bulls ' era .
A loss and this team might have been dismantled on the spot .
But there was an 88 - 83 victory and relief .
`` I 'm sure people will say , and I 've heard it asked , if the swagger is gone from the Bulls , '' Jordan said .
`` Probably .
But no one has taken anything away from us .
We still have an opportunity . ''
A bit tired and worn , the Bulls will drag themselves to Utah for Game 1 of the National Basketball Association finals on Wednesday night .
Jordan put them in position to win a sixth title with the aid of Toni Kukoc 's 21 points .
As usual , Pippen was right there for Jordan , too .
Pippen had 12 rebounds as part of a 50 - 34 rebounding edge that left the Pacers shaking their heads after pushing the Bulls to the brink .
The Pacers had a 1-point lead with 7 minutes left in the game .
Jordan later tied it , and a jumper from Pippen gave the Bulls a lead with 4 minutes 45 seconds left that was threatened but never overtaken .
`` This was probably the toughest playoff series of my career , '' Pippen said .
`` There was the pressure , and being expected to win .
They gave us everything we could ask for .
We just tried to make this one game the biggest game of our season . ''
And of their lives .
Jordan did not give a career performance , but he found his teammates when he had to in a tight game .
They had wrestled with the Pacers before in this series and lost .
But a close game is what the Bulls had .
So they surged ahead and fell behind with Jordan being less than superhuman .
But so was Reggie Miller .
He scored 22 points , but none came in the fourth quarter , and would not be able to save the Pacers .
He would not be able to give Coach Larry Bird a trip to the finals in his rookie season .
`` I felt comfortable that this team could win a championship , '' Bird said .
`` I didn n't get them to where I wanted to take them .
`` We got beat to a lot of loose balls .
They took care of us on the board .
The little things beat us tonight .
They seemed like they were quicker to the ball .
The number of offensive rebounds ripped our hearts out .
I knew I 'd get the effort , but we needed a couple of stars to play big . ''
Miller could not get loose after scoring the third quarter .
Rik Smits scored when he was in the game , but could not maneuver with five fouls on him for most of the fourth quarter .
Without Miller or Smits , there would be no miracle and no shock to the system of all of those conditioned to seeing the Bulls in the finals .
There was something unsettling and unfamiliar seeping into the atmosphere surrounding the Bulls as they took the floor faced with this kind of fate-determining game : insecurity .
This unlikely trait manifested itself as it does with anyone .
Instead of giving their opponent credit , the Bulls offered put-downs these past two weeks , treating the Pacers as a disposable little nuisance .
Here were the defending champions belittling the Pacers when Jordan referred to his team 's loss in Game 3 as a `` bump in the road . ''
Here was a dynasty led by a coach , Phil Jackson , who refused to credit the Pacers by shrugging his coat-hanger shoulders as he blamed officials for their lack of courage and `` swallowing their whistles '' in each Bulls loss .
And after Game 6 , Jordan piped up to announce that the Bulls `` will win Game 7. ''
But beneath this thinly veiled bravado was a gilded team that was afraid of the end , afraid of what would come next if its championship run to five titles would come to a halt .
A day before Game 7 , in a sudden drop of the arrogant shield , Jackson must have sensed the unease creeping into his players ' minds , and he offered this advice in dealing with fear .
`` I told them you can lose , '' Jackson said .
`` Anything 's possible .
You can lose a game like this .
But if you give your best effort , there 's nothing frightening about losing .
Fear is something worse than the actual thing itself . ''
Bird 's motivational speech ?
`` Don n't choke , '' he deadpanned .
There was nothing uptight about the Pacers as this game began .
They came out with cast-iron stomachs .
After hitting their first eight shots and taking a 13-point first-quarter lead , the Pacers learned about the resolve of the Bulls , particularly Jordan .
With a flurry of energy in the second quarter , he shooed away the butterflies and carried the Bulls to within 3 , at 48 - 45 , at the half .
The Bulls , leaning on the hot shooting of Kukoc , took a 8-point edge in the third quarter on Kukoc 's 3-pointer .
But the Pacers came back to tighten things after a couple of turnovers by the Bulls in the final two minutes of the quarter .
That lapse by the Bulls , playing that last stretch with Jordan on the bench , allowed the Pacers to get perilously close .
The Bulls held just a 69 - 65 lead entering the fourth quarter .
The Bulls were not in a groove to begin the game .
The Pacers began the night by taking the ball right to the Bulls ' weak link on defense , using Dale Davis to post up Kukoc .
Davis hit his first four shots and led the Pacers on a tear that left them up by 13 in the first quarter .
Then Jordan restored calm in the second quarter .
Quickly , there was an 8-point Bulls lead .
The Pacers were flustered and out of sync .
Game 6's hero , Travis Best , was launching 3-pointers way off the mark as the Pacers went through a dizzying spell of misses .
At one point , they were 3 of 18 and down by 7 points .
Just as it looked as if the Bulls were taking control , Miller sprang loose to hit back-to-back 3-pointers in the last minute of the half .
Miller 's output pulled the Pacers within , 48 - 45 at the half .
