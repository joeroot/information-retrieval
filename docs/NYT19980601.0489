SOUTH AFRICAN TRIAL HEARS THE QUESTIONS BOTHA WON ' T ANSWER ( JT )
By SUZANNE DALEY c.1998 N.Y .

GEORGE , South Africa _ Over and over Monday , the prosecution in the contempt trial of former President P.W .
Botha used its first witness to lay out the questions that remain unanswered .
What exactly did the man who governed South Africa during its most brutal period of repression mean when he approved , as documents indicate , the elimination , neutralization and permanent removal from society of anti-apartheid activists ?
If he did not mean murder and torture , was anything done to make sure that there was no misunderstanding ?
When , as one witness has testified , concern was raised that such behavior had become widespread , was any action taken ?
And what about the witnesses who have said that they bombed a church building or crossed South Africa 's borders to murder political opponents under direct orders from him ?
As the trial of Botha continued Monday after a six-week recess , the prosecution tried to make clear that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigating atrocities of the past had good reason to want answers from the 82-year-old former president , who is facing charges of contempt for refusing to appear before the panel .
If convicted , he faces a jail sentence of up to two years and a fine .
The sometimes frail-looking Botha , sitting in a specially padded seat because of hip replacement surgery , has remained defiant , calling the Truth Commission a circus and a witch hunt .
Many of his inner circle have maintained that the atrocities committed by the security forces were the work of rogue elements .
But many of the foot soldiers have said that they were following orders from on high .
They describe a world in which they received medals for machine-gunning huts full of women and children .
Truth Commission officials have maintained that they need Botha 's testimony if they are to accomplish their task of investigating and writing a report on the country 's brutal history .
But the decision to take Botha to trial has caused bitterness among whites , many of whom believe the commission is simply trying to humiliate members of the former government .
During his testimony Monday , Paul van Zyl , the executive secretary of the commission , laid out documents and testimony that appeared to link Botha to a number of illegal acts .
In one document , from 1979 , van Zyl said , the State Security Council , an elite circle of security chiefs and Cabinet ministers , discussed plans for top-secret operations against anti-apartheid activists abroad .
Van Zyl testified that the investigative unit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission had received information on cross-border operations where a range of people were killed , using parcel bombs .
`` These were clearly illegal , '' he said .
`` What the TRC would want to know , in fact , is whether the State Security Council did or did not authorize such operations . ''
Botha 's lawyers said in the past that Botha planned a defense based on the notion that he had had a private agreement with the head of the commission , Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu , that he did not have to testify .
But Monday they made clear that they also intended to attack the subpoena on the narrowest procedural grounds .
Much of the cross-examination of van Zyl was over issues such as whether a quorum was present when a decision was made to call Botha .
