NEW YORK -- U.S. billionaire financier George Soros warned that the global economy is facing the risk of recession in the next couple of years despite the current stock market revival , said a report in the Newsweek magazine .
The U.S. stock market is expected to retest previous lows probably next year despite the current record highs in the wake of three rounds of interest cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve since September 29 , he told the December 7 issue of Newsweek .
The U.S. economy is amid a " fairly mature boom " and faces growing cost pressures while Japan is still in recession and Brazil may follow suit , although it has received an aid package of 41.5 billion U.S. dollars , he said .
