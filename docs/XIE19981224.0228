F1 Newcomers Fight Colour
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Formula One newcomers , British American Racing ( BAR ) , are to mount a legal challenge to the sport 's governing body over a ruling that teams can not run two cars in substantially different liveries .
BAR want to field cars in colours representing different cigarette brands and claim the International Automobile Federation 's regulation restricts commercial freedom when dealing with potential sponsors .
The team , which includes former world champion Jacques Villeneuve , has been testing its new car at the Montmelo circuit near Barcelona this week .
Managing director Craig Pollock said : " We have tried to explore every possible avenue to resolve the matter and avoid taking this course of action .
" Unfortunately , the FIA did not give us any other option and we have therefore initiated formal legal proceedings , " he said .
BAR has a multi-million pound agreement with chief sponsors British American Tobacco and wants to run cars in colours representing different brands of cigarette .
The new rule was introduced after the team 's decision to enter Formula One in the 1999 season , which gets under way at the Australian Grand Prix in less than three months .
" We have already demonstrated that we will do everything possible to be a serious contender in Formula One and therefore have no choice but to take all legal steps available to protect our interests and those of our sponsors , " Pollock added .
