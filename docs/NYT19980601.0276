AIRLINES PREPARE TO FIGHT HEART ATTACKS ALOFT
( For release Sun . , June 7 ) ( JT ) By MATTHEW L. WALD c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
WASHINGTON _ Among a planeload of passengers there is almost always a doctor , nurse or medical technician , but when an airliner is at cruise altitude , the nearest equipment to diagnose or treat a heart attack is usually seven miles below .
& QL ;
Now , however , American Airlines , Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines are equipping their planes with a machine that is a combination heart monitor and defibrillator _ that is , a device that produces an EKG , and one that shocks the heart back into normal rhythm if necessary .
The device is already credited with saving one passenger 's life , on a flight from Dallas to Mexico City on Feb. 18 , and has helped many other times to determine whether a stricken passenger was , in fact , having a heart attack .
& QL ;
In equipping their planes , the airlines are following the lead set by Qantas , which flies mostly long over-water flights where there is no place to land in an emergency .
But the United States carriers are planning the equipment for their domestic flights , too .
& QL ;
As the big airlines adopt the policy , Congress has directed the Federal Aviation Administration to study whether all airlines should be required to carry more medical equipment .
& QL ;
Medical emergency may not be the first risk that leaps to a traveler 's mind when boarding an airplane , but in some years heart attacks in the sky are more frequent than deaths or injuries in crashes .
The FAA does not keep statistics , but the Air Transport Association , the trade group of the big airlines , asked its members to keep track during 1996 , and it counted 141 heart attacks and 433 cases of passengers complaining of chest pain .
Among the 578 million passengers that year , there were 10,500 medical incidents _ one for each 55,000 passengers , or one for each 780 flights .
& QL ;
The airlines say they can not keep track of fatalities because once a patient is taken off a plane , they do not follow up .
& QL ;
The heart equipment the airlines are using is a $ 3,000 battery-powered device called Forerunner , manufactured by Heartstream Inc. , a Seattle company .
The device has been sold to police and other nonmedical agencies , the company says , because it can be used with very little training .
& QL ;
After paddles are applied to a patient 's chest , the device senses electrical currents from the heart and decides whether a heart attack is , in fact , in progress , and whether defibrillation is needed .
& QL ;
At American , John Hotard , a spokesman , said that since his company began putting the Forerunners on its planes about a year ago , they had been used 49 times , but in only three cases did the Forerunner decide that shocks were needed .
Two passengers died anyway but the third , on Feb. 18 , survived .
& QL ;
The machine provides data that a doctor could use to make treatment decisions .
`` We have found , if the first nine months are any indication , that the machine has more value to the doctor as a heart monitor than actually shocking someone , '' Hotard said .
& QL ;
With the diagnostic tool on board , American has also beefed up the medical kits on its planes , Hotard said .
These kits , separate from the first-aid kits kept in the cabin , are in the cockpit and can be released only by the captain ; they contain prescription drugs that can be used to treat cardiac arrest , epileptic seizure , asthma , bronchitis , psychosis , nausea , vomiting and other disorders .
The drugs could be administered by a physician who happened to be on board , or on the orders of an airline physician on the ground , contacted by radio .
& QL ;
American began installing the defibrillators in November 1996 .
In March of this year it announced that it would equip all its 640 aircraft by this November .
Alaska Airlines said in February that it would equip all its planes , and Delta said in January that by 2000 all its flights , including commuter flights , would carry the Forerunner and enhanced medical kits .
& QL ;
Separately , legislation now before Congress would offer good-Samaritan protection against lawsuits to anyone who assisted a stricken passenger , whether a member of the cabin crew or a fellow passenger .
Many states have such laws for highway accident victims , but the law covering plane passengers is not clear .
& QL ;
While the drugs and the heart devices may help sick patients , they can also help the airlines and all the other passengers , aviation experts say .
An emergency stop , counting landing fees and extra fuel , can run from $ 3,000 to $ 5 , 000 , and make hundreds of passengers miss their connections .
& QL ;
American has to divert a plane for medical reasons about 150 times a year , Hotard said , or about one flight in 5 , 400 .
The Air Transport Association study found 557 emergency landings for medical reasons in 1996 , of which 183 , or about a third , were for cardiovascular problems .
Other reasons included neurological problems ( 88 ) , seizures ( 51 ) , respiratory problems ( 37 ) , gastrointestinal problems ( 33 ) and `` other '' ( 93 ) .
& QL ;
Among other reasons for landing : in-flight trauma ( 10 ) , pregnancy ( 9 ) , allergy to food ( 4 ) , unruly passenger ( 1 ) and death ( 7 ) .
Of the 529 million passengers carried that year , 42 died in flight .
