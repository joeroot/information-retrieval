Pak-India Dialogue for Just , Durable Settlement of Kashmir Dispute : Official
ISLAMABAD , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Pakistan Wednesday said its dialogue with India on the Kashmir issue is exclusively directed toward a just and durable settlement of the dispute in accordance with the relevant U.N. resolutions .
This was stated by a Foreign Office spokesman while commenting on Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 's statement that the dialogue was meant to discuss the status of Azad Kashmir ( Pakistan-controlled Kashmir ) .
The spokesman reiterated that Pakistan remains committed to engaging in bilateral and multilateral efforts to resolve the Kashmir dispute .
India , he said , " should realize that the settlement of this issue can no longer be postponed . "
He accused India of refusing to honor its international commitments and allow the people of Kashmir to exercise their right of self-determination , which he said provides the only basis for resolving this dispute .
The spokesman said nuclearization of South Asia has converted Kashmir into a nuclear flash point .
Now there is a strong conviction in the international community to find an early settlement of the Kashmir dispute , he added .
