PATRIOTS RUN DOWN OPTIONS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By NICK CAFARDO c.1998 The Boston Globe
FOXBOROUGH , Mass. _ The Patriots are raw at running back this season .
Real raw .
In fact , by the time this week 's rookie camp and next weekend 's full-squad camp end , the team will have looked at nine backs .
Their combined NFL experience ?
Seven years .
When rookie camp begins Monday at Foxboro Stadium , the team 's coaching staff and management will be hoping that Robert Edwards , Sedrick Shaw , Harold Shaw , Derrick Cullors , Tony Carter , Chris Floyd , Marrio Grier , and two others can make up for the losses of Curtis Martin , Sam Gash , Keith Byars , and Dave Meggett .
Edwards was the team 's No. 1 draft pick , the 18th player taken overall .
He is the odds-on favorite to be the starting halfback and projects a tougher runner than Martin , hitting the holes better .
But he never has played in an NFL game .
Sedrick Shaw started his only NFL game in the Jan. 3 7 - 6 playoff loss to Pittsburgh .
Before that , the third-round pick from Iowa primarily had been on the practice squad .
Harold Shaw is a sixth-rounder from Brett Favre 's alma mater , Southern Mississippi State .
He 's a 6-foot , 228-pounder who runs straight ahead , and has been termed the sleeper in the group by some Patriots officials .
Cullors saw his first action last year filling in for Martin when he was injured .
The best bet at the moment is fullback Carter , who played three years for the Chicago Bears before being signed by the Patriots to replace the popular Gash .
Grier , who can play fullback and halfback , has been around for two seasons , used mostly as a special teams player .
Floyd , from Michigan , is considered a good blocker .
Also in the running back mix is rookie free agent Rodney Byrd , a 6 - 2 , 245-pound halfback / fullback from Illinois ( where he played with Robert Holcombe , who was taken in the second round by St. Louis ) .
Mike Geter of North Carolina ( 5 - 10 , 215 ) is not to be mistaken for Gash , whose No. 33 he will wear .
Those nine have rushed for a career 563 yards on 162 carries ( a 3.47-yard average ) .
Grier is the most experienced with 77 carries for 203 yards .
After carrying 22 times during the regular season , Cullors ran 29 times for 104 yards in the postseason , including a 22-carries-for-86 yards effort against Miami in the wild-card game .
Carter has 30 career carries for 133 yards .
And Sedrick Shaw carried 10 times for 22 yards in the Pittsburgh game .
Is there reason for concern ?
`` We have young players at that position and we 'd like to see how they perform in these camps , '' said coach Pete Carroll .
`` We wished we 'd given Sedrick a little more playing time during the season last year in retrospect , but we decided to go with Derrick when Curtis went down .
`` We feel we have talent .
The experience isn n't there , but with Robert Edwards and Sedrick and Derrick , there 's ability that just needs time-tested NFL experience for those talents to come out . ''
It is the reason the Patriots haven n't pushed the panic button and signed a veteran running back yet .
`` We 'll wait until our camps are over so we can assess what we have and what we feel we need , if anything , '' said vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier .
The Patriots will consider veterans , some of them free agents who haven n't been signed right away such as Terry Kirby , Erric Pegram , Greg Hill , Raymont Harris , and Robert Green .
They also will check the waiver wire this week for veterans who may be dumped for salary cap reasons _ possibly someone such as Ronnie Harmon , who can add a third-down pass-receiving threat ( filling the role of Meggett and Byars ) .
It appears the Patriots believe Edwards and Sedrick Shaw will be able to handle the load as the primary halfbacks and that Carter and Floyd can be the blocking fullbacks they need .
The one question is how well Edwards and Shaw block .
Often it 's the running back who makes the last key block to allow the quarterback time to make a pass .
Will those two , with their lack of experience , be able to pick up blitzes ?
There are many questions about the backfield that will remain unanswered until the raw talent gets some experience .
The Patriots took a chance on an unproven back when they drafted Martin and it panned out .
& QL ; & QL ; & QL ;
Bruce Armstrong missed the entire offseason strength and conditioning program , as is his custom .
According to Armstrong 's agent , John Geletka , `` He 's taken great care of himself and has worked out very consistently . ''
...
The Patriots weren n't able to get their other starting tackle , Zefross Moss , into camp early to check out his weight and conditioning .
According to Carroll , Moss , who also skipped the strength and conditioning workouts , has told him that he 's in shape and not to worry .
Last summer , Moss reported to camp overweight ...
One Jets executive , not Bill Parcells , said the team has no interest in Meggett because it has Leon Johnson , whom Parcells brought along last year .
But the final word hasn n't come from His Tunaship yet .
