Commentary Criticizing Cheating Activities
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The China Youth Daily carried a commentary Saturday criticizing cheating activities in the presence of Premier Zhu Rongji .
The commentary quoted a report by the " Focus Report " of the China Central Television ( CCTV ) on November 12 , which said that a grain distribution station in Nanling County of east China 's Anhui Province borrowed large quantities of grain from other grain stations and grain processing factories to cheat Premier Zhu Rongji that the station has plenty of grain in its grain depots early this year .
The county also refused to implement the central government 's policy on buying farmers ' extra grain at protective prices , and only purchased 50 percent of the set quotas .
The county covered up all these in its report to Zhu during his inspection .
The commentary pointed out that some places often fabricate fake statistics , examples and evidence to cheat leaders at higher levels , and the masses of people have been very angry with such activities .
The commentary cited several facts and praised the Chinese government as a government which seeks truth from facts and is not easy to be cheated .
The commentary also warned that any cheating activity , just as that of the grain station , is doomed to get nowhere .
