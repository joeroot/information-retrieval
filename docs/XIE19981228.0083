Estrada Reiterates Commitment to Saving PAL
MANILA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Philippine President Estrada said here Monday that negotiations to save Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) will reach a happy conclusion by January next year .
In an interview , Estrada said that there will be a settlement with Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways , " hopefully by next month . "
" They 're still negotiating and I hope they will settle it , hopefully by next month , " he said .
The president reiterated his administration 's commitment to saving PAL " at all costs , " saying too much is at stake if the airline shuts down .
He explained that among the airlines now operating in the Philippines , only PAL has the capability to fly to all domestic routes and carry passengers and cargoes to these destinations .
" We are trying our best to save PAL because if PAL closes , all businesses will be affected , " Estrada said .
Last week , Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora disclosed that talks are still going on between PAL and possible strategic partners , including Cathay Pacific .
Earlier , Cathay Pacific announced it was pulling out of talks following speculations that a takeover of PAL management may violate the country 's 1987 constitution .
Under the constitution , foreign companies can own only up to 40 percent of any business firm in the Philippines .
