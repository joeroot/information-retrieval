BOEHNER USING DISPUTE WITH MCDERMOTT AS FUND-RAISING TOOL
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By MICHAEL PAULSON c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
WASHINGTON _ House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner is using his dispute with Rep. Jim McDermott as a fund-raising tool , urging potential campaign contributors to send money to `` help me bring the Democrats to justice . ''
Boehner is using his campaign treasury to pay for a lawsuit against McDermott , who he believes provided newspaper reporters with a tape of an illegally recorded phone conversation between Boehner , House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other top House Republicans .
`` Americans are fed up with self-righteous liberals who think eavesdropping , illegally taping private conversations , and leaking privileged information are OK as long as it 's the Democrats who are doing it , '' Boehner wrote .
In the fund-raising appeal , Boehner also appeared to threaten Attorney General Janet Reno , who he says has `` hemmed and hawed , stewed and stalled , diddled and delayed '' instead of bringing charges against McDermott .
`` I 've grown weary of her foot-dragging and his legal tactics to hide the truth , '' Boehner wrote .
`` It 's time for Janet Reno to do her job or face the consequences . ''
Boehner , R-Ohio , did not specify in the letter what consequences Reno should face for declining to prosecute McDermott , D-Wash , although at one point he wrote `` if Janet Reno won n't do her job , she shouldn n't have her job . ''
Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg said Monday `` the investigation ( of McDermott ) is ongoing and active .
I 'm not in a position to be any more specific . ''
He declined to comment on Boehner 's letter .
The dispute between Boehner and McDermott began in December 1996 , when Boehner , sitting in a car in the parking lot of a Florida waffle house , used his wife 's cellular telephone to participate in a phone conversation with GOP leaders .
The call was picked up on a police scanner and taped by a couple active in Democratic politics in Florida .
The couple gave the tape to McDermott , who was the senior Democrat on the House Ethics Committee investigating Gingrich .
Days later , stories about the tape appeared in three newspapers , one of which described its source as a congressman hostile to Gingrich .
McDermott has refused to say whether he provided the tape to the papers .
In the wake of no public action by the Justice Department , Boehner filed suit against McDermott , accusing him of violating federal and Florida laws protecting the privacy of electronic communications .
Boehner 's fund-raising letter , sent in late March , was filed Monday in U.S. District Court by McDermott 's lawyers , who cited the letter as evidence that the case is motivated by a partisan battle and not by serious legal matters .
In their brief , McDermott 's lawyers insisted that the Constitution protects the Seattle Democrat 's right to leak to newspapers the contents of an illegally recorded telephone call .
There is no question that the Florida couple who recorded the conversation violated the law _ they have been fined for their role in the incident _ but McDermott argues that simply receiving the tape and passing it to a newspaper is not illegal .
`` This case presents about as stark an issue of free speech as can be imagined : one political leader is seeking to punish another political leader for allegedly disclosing a conversation among some of the nation 's top political leaders on a political topic , '' McDermott argued .
McDermott argued that the content of the conversation _ how Republican leaders should respond to the upcoming reprimand of Gingrich _ was a matter of significant public interest .
`` This is core political speech , and lies at the very heart of the First Amendment , '' McDermott argued .
`` If a citizen who lawfully obtains such speech can be punished for disclosing it to the media , the protections of the First Amendment are more illusory than real . ''
A lawyer for Boehner said McDermott 's brief ignores the legal issues and is notable mostly for its absence of any denial that McDermott leaked the recording of the telephone call .
`` He 's pursuing a two-pronged attack , the first being to toss in a bunch of fiery rhetoric and invective , and the second being to ignore the legal arguments that were made in our response , '' said Ted Cruz , a lawyer for Boehner .
`` No court in the history of our nation , federal or state , has accepted the argument that he 's making . ''
Cruz also defended Boehner 's right to raise money for the case .
`` It is certainly true that Congressman McDermott is going to defend this case in a way that 's going to pursue delay and cost a lot of money , and I think Congressman Boehner is perfectly justified in trying to raise the funds to try to counteract that , '' Cruz said .
`` This would be a very simple case if it weren n't for Congressman McDermott 's repeated efforts to hide the facts and use every legal tool he can to drag it out . ''
A McDermott campaign adviser said the Seattle congressman has not used the dispute with Boehner as a fund-raising tool , but that it is possible he will do so in the future .
The brief filed Monday was the last in a series of written arguments over whether Boehner 's lawsuit should be dismissed .
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan is now expected to schedule oral arguments .
Meanwhile , Boehner 's lawyers have sent McDermott a series of written questions , demanding to know exactly what McDermott 's role was in the transmission of the tape to newspaper reporters .
McDermott is expected to attempt to avoid responding to those questions at least until after a judge decides whether to dismiss the case .
