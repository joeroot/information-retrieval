Russian FM Stresses Importance of Russia-China Ties
MOSCOW , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Peace , stability and a new multipolar order in the world to a great extent depend on the level of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing , Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said here Saturday .
In a written interview with Xinhua on the eve of a visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Russia , Ivanov said both countries are experiencing a stage of great reforms oriented to tapping the economic potentials and further increasing material benefits for the two peoples .
The coming summit will be the first unofficial meeting between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin , which allows them in a trustful atmosphere to discuss important issues of bilateral cooperation , to exchange views on the developing tendency of international politics , and to calibrate their positions on the most important international issues , Ivanov said .
The foreign minister noted that before the visit Russia and China have successfully completed demarcation on their common border .
Now they are taking confidence-building measures and military transparency along the border , which set a good example of successful resolution of delicate and complicated problems for the world community .
Satisfied with the development of the Russian-Chinese relations , Ivanov said that meetings between leaders of the two countries allow for the creation of a unique mechanism of state-to-state cooperation in dealing with not only bilateral relations , but also the cardinal problems in world politics .
Ivanov also said that close contacts with his Chinese counterpart , Tang Jiaxuan , " allow us to regularly ` synchronize watches ' and coordinate positions to the most acute international problems . "
He was confident that the further development of active interaction between Russia and China on the world arena accords with the interests of both countries , as well as security and stabilization of the world .
Ivanov , meanwhile , noted the need for common efforts to reverse the situation whereby economic interaction lags behind political interaction .
The foreign minister believed that through meetings and negotiations during the upcoming summit , the two countries will find resolutions of the outstanding problems and make real progress in deepening the beneficial trade-economic cooperation between the two countries .
Russia and China , as two great powers and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , have special responsibility for world peace and security , Ivanov said .
" We well understand it and act accordingly . "
He emphasized that strengthening the Russian-Chinese partnership oriented to strategic interaction is contributing to stabilizing international politics and helping to settle international conflicts .
