Primakov : Russia to Continue Reforms
MOSCOW , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Sunday that his country will stick to economic reforms and political democracy but the government would make " considerable corrections " for the good of the people .
" The course of reforms in Russia will undoubtedly be preserved and continued , " Primakov was quoted as saying in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag .
" There will be no return to the administrative-command system , " Primakov said .
" We will not yield an inch in the principle of society 's democratization and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens . "
However , he said , there would be " considerable corrections in our reforms and these corrections will be oriented to the needs of the people . "
He listed the payment of wage and pension arrears , expanded sources of taxation to spur production and restructuring the national economy as his government 's priorities .
" The social tension in the country has reached a dangerous limit , " Primakov said , adding that efforts would be made to convince the Russians that " strikes and disobedience campaigns of the railroad blockade type do not solve problems , but just aggravate the situation . "
He said that " at some stage Russian reforms started lacking a social component , no bridge was built between what was on the whole a correct desire to put state finances in order and the real needs of people , whose interests the state has proven unable to protect . "
Primakov said the government was still working on a program to tide over the crisis , " but its principal , strategic elements are evident to us . "
" I am convinced that on the basis of its implementation we will be able to consolidate the society , tired of economic troubles and political strife which have taken years , " he said .
The 69-year-old former Foreign Minister , only a little over one week into the new job , acknowledged that today 's situation in Russia is " undoubtedly complicated , to put it mildly . "
" I was aware what was in store for me when I was accepting the insistent proposal of the president of the Russian Federation , Boris Yeltsin , that I head the Russian government .
But the reality has proven even more serious . "
He reiterated that he would not run in the 2000 presidential race even though he was successful as head of the government .
" It is one of the conditions for an efficient work of my cabinet , " Primakov said .
While calling on his countrymen to fight civil apathy and try to adapt to the new life , Primakov urged the outside word to continue support Russia .
" Foreign support is necessary , very necessary , " he said .
