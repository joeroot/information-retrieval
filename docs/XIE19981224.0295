Iran Passes Law to Guarantee Foreign Investment
TEHRAN , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Iranian Majlis ( parliament ) Wednesday passed a law providing guarantees to foreign investment in a bid to revive the ailing economy badly hit by oil prices slump .
Under the law , the Iranian government will guarantee foreign investments in the free industrial and trade zones against state takeover or even in case of a nationalization drive , the state-run television reported .
The law helps to assure foreign investors of investment security in Iran , Secretary General of High Council of Free Industrial and Trade Zones Morteza Alviri told the television .
Before this , he said , the Free Trade Zone Organization ( FTZO ) shelters foreign investments up to a certain ceiling .
However , Alviri said in October , it is up to the government to provide guarantees to huge foreign investments in free trade zones .
Some investors had expressed their readiness to invest over one billion U.S. dollars in the zones , he said , meanwhile they seek legal guarantees to their investments .
In an effort to boost the country 's non-oil sectors , Iran set up three free trade zones on the Gulf islands of Qeshm and Kish and the port city of Chahbahar on the Gulf of Oman .
So far they failed to attract foreign investments as foreign investors claimed they saw no guarantees for their investments in the country .
The new law also allows operation of foreign banks and insurance companies and permits free foreign exchange dealings under market rates in the zones .
Iran banned foreign exchange dealings outside state banks in 1995 after the United States imposed economic sanctions on it .
