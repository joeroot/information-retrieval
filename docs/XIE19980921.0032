Chiluba , Rwandan Leader Discuss Congo Crisis
LUSAKA , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba consulted Sunday with his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu in Kigali in an effort to end the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
Chiluba did not disclose the details of the meeting but said the talks lasting for two hours went on very well , the television here reported Sunday evening .
Meanwhile , Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa flew to Kigali for similar talks with Rwandan leaders on the latest effort to end the fighting in Congo ( K ) .
Returning from Rwanda Sunday afternoon , Chiluba said he was satisfied with the consultations respectively held with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe of Uganda on Saturday and with Rwandan leaders in Kigali on Sunday .
Chiluba said so much has been achieved and they all emerged very optimistic about the talks but there is still need for more consultations with the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) leaders .
However , he said , nobody will be satisfied until peace is achieved in Congo .
Chiluba said he will inform the leaders of the cease-fire modalities in Congo concluded in Entebbe on Sunday by presidents of Uganda , Tanzania and Zambia .
He also said the SADC leaders will also be briefed on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the vast central African country .
Tanzanian and Zambian presidents are considered as neutral in the Congo conflict and were mandated to spearhead the Congo peace drive by the SADC summit held last week in Grand Baie of Mauritius .
Three SADC countries , Zimbabwe , Angola and Namibia , dispatched troops to Congo to prop up President Laurent Kabila .
Kabila has been accusing Rwanda and Uganda of invading to overtly give military support to the anti-Kabila rebels who took up arms against Kabila on August 2.
