TOYOTA 'S 1998 LAND CRUISER IS BEST OF THE SUVS
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
The best has just gotten better .
It 's hard to imagine the king of the sport utilities getting any better than it was , but that 's what happened when Toyota redesigned the Land Cruiser for 1998 .
This is the vehicle that has set the standard for sport-utilities since the previous generation debuted in 1991 , even against such tough and capable competition as the Range Rover and Lincoln Navigator .
But for 1998 , Toyota has raised the bar to a level that will be hard for any manufacturer to match , let alone top .
The new Land Cruiser _ which also comes in a Lexus version called the LX 470 _ now has a 4.7-liter , 32-valve , double-overhead-cam V-8 engine replacing the previous generation 's inline six .
That engine cranks out 230 horsepower , an increase of 18 , and develops 320 foot-pounds of torque , up 45 from last year .
This all-new engine is based on the V-8 used in the Lexus LS 400 sedan , but it 's significantly modified to produce better low-speed torque for trailer-towing and off-road hill-climbing .
The Land Cruiser goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds , an improvement of two seconds over last year 's model .
That 's quite impressive for a vehicle that weighs 5,225 pounds empty .
Fuel economy is slightly better than last year , even with the power increase .
EPA ratings are 14 miles per gallon in the city and 16 on the highway , above average for a large sport-utility .
The Land Cruiser is first and foremost a great luxury wagon , suitable for the most formal of occasions at the country club .
But what makes it so unusual in the sport-utility field is that it 's also a great performer off the beaten path .
In fact , it 's the best-performing off-road vehicle on the market , bar none .
Granted , with a base price of $ 46,397 and a tricked-out sticker of $ 52 , 025 , it 's not likely many owners will put the Land Cruiser to the test on serious off-road routes such as California 's legendary Rubicon Trail .
But many of these vehicles will answer the call of the wild .
A lot of people buy the Land Cruiser for hunting and other sporting purposes , and these people appreciate having a vehicle that won n't get stuck in the mud or sand .
I haven n't extensively tested the new Land Cruiser off-road yet , but I have driven the previous generation on some of the wildest trails in the nation , including those in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California and the Scott 's Gulf Pocket Wilderness along the Caney Fork River in Tennessee 's Cumberland Mountains .
And on those excursions , I 've used the Land Cruiser to pull a few Jeeps out of some sticky spots that posed no challenge to the Toyota .
On or off the road , the new Land Cruiser 's ride is pure luxury , much smoother and quieter than before .
That 's due in part to the new independent front suspension and the vehicle 's structural rigidity , which has been increased 50 percent over the previous version .
The four-wheel drive is a full-time system with high and low ranges , as before .
And with the optional locking rear differential ( $ 410 ) , a must for serious off-roading , this is the most capable drivetrain available for either on - or off-road driving .
Standard features abound , including automatic climate control , four-speed automatic transmission , four-wheel antilock brakes that work even with the transmission in low range , premium AM / FM / cassette / compact disc stereo , rear heater , power windows / door locks / mirrors , tilt steering wheel , cruise control , heated outside mirrors , dual front air bags , keyless entry , power adjustable front seats and automatic headlights .
Interior space has been increased from last year , giving passengers more head , leg and shoulder room .
Additionally , the doors and rear hatch are larger for easier entry and loading .
And as before , the Land Cruiser seats up to eight people with the optional third seat ( $ 1,100 ) .
Extras on our test vehicle included luxurious leather seats ( $ 1,820 ) , power moon roof ( $ 1,155 ) , a roof luggage rack ( $ 449 ) , and running boards ( $ 595 ) , which I would decline if I were planning to do much off-roading .
Running boards are the first thing to go when the going gets tough .
Crashworthiness has been increased dramatically over the previous Land Cruiser , Toyota officials say .
The ladder frame now has nine cross members , instead of six , and the chassis side rails have collapsible , energy-absorbing ends .
Land Cruisers can pull trailers of up to 6,500 pounds with a tongue weight of up to 650 pounds .
As an aid for extended cruising , the fuel tank holds 25.4 gallons .
