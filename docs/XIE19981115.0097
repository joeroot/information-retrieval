Mahathir Regrets Over Clinton 's Absence at APEC
KUALA LUMPUR , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Malaysian prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Sunday expressed regret over the news that U.S. President Bill Clinton will not be able to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) leaders ' informal meeting on November 17 - 18 .
" If U.S. President Bill Clinton had come here for the APEC leaders ' summit , he would have known that contrary to press reports , Malaysia is a peaceful country , " he told reporters during a dialogue session after opening the APEC Business Summit here .
He said Clinton had never been to Malaysia although many Americans have been here .
" Some have never been here but talk about the deteriorating situation in Malaysia , " Mahathir said .
On the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq , Mahathir said he had always hoped that " we can settle the Iraq problem through negotiation .
I do not think that bombing Iraq would do anything better to solve the problem . "
Commenting on the latest reports that Clinton would not be coming to the APEC leaders ' informal meeting due to the problems with Iraq , Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Sunday Malaysia feels that it is better for U.S. President Bill Clinton to attend the APEC summit here despite being bogged down by the problems .
However , he said , " if Clinton has problems at home and can not attend , it does not matter . "
" Even without the presence of Clinton , the APEC summit will go ahead as scheduled , " he said after bilateral talks with Japan 's Minister of Foreign Affairs Masahiko Komura .
