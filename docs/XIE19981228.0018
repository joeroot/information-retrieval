Four Ugandans Killed in Church Collapse
KAMPALA , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- At least four Ugandans were killed and 13 others injured when a crowded church near capital Kampala collapsed Sunday , Radio Uganda reported .
The report said there were at least 300 people attending services in the hastily-erected church when it suddenly collapsed .
Three people including a priest died on the spot while a two-year-old girl died just minutes before reaching Mulago hospital in the capital city .
Police are now in the process of finding out from the city council whether the church was built on an approved plan and whether the construction was supervised .
Residents are warned to stay away from the obviously shaky 10-meter-high walls because they can fall at any time .
