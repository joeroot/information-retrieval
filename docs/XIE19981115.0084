Asari Wins Tokyo Marathon
TOKYO , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The 1993 world champion Junko Asari held off the strong challenge from fellow Japanese Ari Ichihashi to win the Tokyo international women 's marathon in a thrilling finish here on Sunday .
In a shoulder-to-shoulder battle against fellow Ichihashi in the last five kilometers , Asari lost her lead briefly in the last 100 meters but surged ahead again to cross the finishing line in two hours 28 minutes 29 seconds , only a half a step faster than Ichihara , who also clocked the same time .
Asari won the 1995 Tokyo marathon to be nominated for the Atlanta Olympics , where she finished a disappointed 17th after developing a blister .
But she showed she had recovered from the slow finish by coming into second at the Rotterdam marathon .
Japan 's Azumi Miyazaki took third place in her debut marathon in 2 : 30 : 06 , while Katrin Dorre-Heining of Germany , three-time Tokyo marathon champion in 1984 , 1985 and 1987 , was fifth in 2 : 31 : 44 .
Atlanta Olympic champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia stopped several times after passing the 37 kilometer mark and once sat down on the street , but managed to finish the race , coming in eighth in 2 : 36 : 22 .
