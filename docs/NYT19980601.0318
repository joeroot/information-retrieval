Knopf .
269 pp .
$ 23 .
Poor Freud .
Democratized , deified , misunderstood , and finally vilified , he dared to open the Pandora 's Box of the unconscious and then encouraged us to spill the contents .
For this courageous transgression he has been the celebrated scapegoat of the human condition ever since , as though he himself were responsible for all the little cruelties of neurosis and the hidden behemoths of the id .
Ah , well .
His spirit is probably safe enough , with a defender like Dr. Morales .
`` You want to slice up Freud the Father like a sausage , no ? ''
he might say to a cowering analysand .
`` You feel this patricidal wish of death , and so you visit it upon the man who is trying to save you !
Bah !
I have no time for this .
Go away ; you are boring me . ''
In his hilarious and terrifying construction of the analyst provocateur at the heart of `` The Treatment , '' Daniel Menaker has given us a shrink of such adversarial proportion it makes you long for the Good Witch Glenda in his stead .
Cuban , Catholic , a `` madman privateer '' with an office on the Upper East Side , Dr. Ernesto Morales uses his emigre English to make heinous accusations and awful puns , yawns and shuffles papers when he 's piqued , then demands details of his patient 's sex life to perk himself up .
On the couch for these harangues is the novel 's narrator , Jake Singer , a 30 ish teacher of blue-blazer boys at the tony Coventry School who has come to Morales for the usual large and small reasons : old losses , broken relationships , destructively impulsive behavior .
What he finds in the alleged sanctum sanctorum is less epiphany than pectoral-building battleground : Jake confesses , Morales insults and humiliates , Jake departs to fight on higher ground .
Theirs is a therapy from Dante as enacted by the Marx Brothers , in other words , and its diabolical brilliance is that Jake must change , if only to get away from his tormentor .
This folie a deux forms the larger reality of `` The Treatment , '' even though Jake 's story , as lived in the real world , soon branches out from Morales 's grip to the less predictable milieu of work and love .
In keeping with its psychotherapeutic predecessors ( David Lodge 's `` Therapy , '' Judith Rossner 's `` August '' ) , `` The Treatment '' presumes to examine the flotsam of life 's incidents through the lens of a therapeutic narrative .
Menaker 's novel is actually more at home within this realm ; like the community of the therapized , it has some trouble taking its transitions ( and transformations ) to the streets .
But you don n't have to be a congregant at the church of Freud to get the jokes in `` The Treatment , '' or to bask in the luminously treacherous portrayal of Morales .
Finest of all , one is never quite sure if the man is a loose pistol or a calculating saint .
He is delivered to us , after all , through Jake 's less than objective rendering .
That mutability , of both fact and affect , is the major theme coursing through `` The Treatment '' : That life is random and fiercely relative , that a flat tire in Hoboken can influence the entire world of a kid in SoHo .
Menaker has submerged his serious , even sorrowful story within the guise of a comic novel ; like his protagonist , he is funny but deep , and the jokes are usually sublimated ( or displaced ) signposts pointing to a far darker anxiety .
An editor at The New Yorker for years , Menaker is also the author of the highly respected story collection `` The Old Left '' ; his aesthetic bent seems made for the shorter form , in fact , and that is both one of the strengths of `` The Treatment '' _ its laconic , gossamer insights _ as well as its primary weakness .
When the novel diverges into the greater path of Jake 's life beyond the consulting room , it has a tendency to veer toward pastiche .
( It becomes clear , for instance , that the novel is set in the early 1970s and that Jake sits around strumming old protest songs on his guitar _ none of which has anything to do with the plot . ) While one side-story in particular is fully realized , the vignettes , stitched together , lack novelistic heft ; they also indulge a few plot contrivances , as well as cringingly bad sexual moments , that Morales himself would scarcely believe .
But then coincidence , or the mystical power of cause and effect , may be the one transformative device a guy like Jake can believe in ; thus far , he 's been wrestled to the ground by the gods of chaos , and even Morales concedes `` the general arbitrariness of the human condition . ''
Certainly artifice _ presented here as the organizing principle of fiction , the idea of a purpose to life 's jumbled narrative _ has sustained Jake at the Coventry School , where he takes refuge in the classics , passing on those promises to his half-innocent charges .
The only child of a Jewish cardiologist whose wife died when the boy was 6 , Jake has spent most of his life bucking his father 's chilly reserve and trying to recover from the loss of his mother ; he has the heart of a poet , not a doctor , and that familial misfire has made him a teacher as well as an alienated prodigal son .
When he falls for Allegra Marshall , the wealthy and recently widowed mother of a Coventry student , their liaison offers all the possibilities of what Morales would call ( no doubt dismissively ) a corrective experience .
Allegra 's relations to her two children lead Jake into a picaresque tale that wanders from Manhattan to western Massachusetts , reflecting the unresolved themes of his own life : the contractual loyalty of family , the promise of children , the mutual relevance of duty and love .
Hovering throughout is Dr. Morales , either in singular three-dimensional form or cathected as an inner voice _ sarcastic , challenging , and sometimes wise _ in Jake 's ongoing interior monologue .
It 's high tribute to this particular Dr. Strangelove that Jake 's forays into the larger world can seem frustratingly diversionary ; we long to get back to that uncomfortable couch , if only to witness the tortures Morales will inflict from his desk on high .
But Jake _ like any analysand , successful or failed _ must eventually make his own way .
That he emerges here , as the wistful , seasoned voice of this mostly intelligent novel , is some kind of proof that the treatment must have taken .
That Menaker has rendered his tyrannical creation with such sweet authenticity is testament to an even greater truth , one Morales no doubt would cherish : the core ambivalence of love itself , the inherent wish to kill the thing we need the most .
