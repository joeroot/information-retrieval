Italy Cuts Discount Rate to Euro Criterion
ROME , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The Bank of Italy cut its discount rate to three percent on Wednesday , bringing it in line with the rates in the other 10 European Union ( EU ) countries adopting the euro on January 1 , 1999 .
The decision , which will go into effect on December 28 , takes the interest rate to its lowest level since the foundation of the Italian republic in 1947 .
The move came just one week before the end-of-year deadline for interest rate convergence .
On December 3 , Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio became the only one of the Euro-11 central bankers not to drop his country 's rate to three percent .
He held back for fear that too much liquidity would be dangerous at a time when Italy 's political situation appears unstable .
But with the approval of the 1999 budget and a 1.5 percent inflation forecast for this month , the market expected the Bank of Italy to announce the cut immediately .
