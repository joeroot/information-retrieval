GIANTS MAKE MAY A WINNER BY HENRY SCHULMAN
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle
SAN FRANCISCO _ June has arrived with a schedule full of land mines for the Giants .
They have three more games at St. Louis , where Mark McGwire plays even bigger than his frame .
They have seven meetings against the first-place San Diego Padres , and four interleague games against the A 's , who always find a way to give them a searing pain behind the temples .
The best thought the Giants can carry into battle this month is the knowledge that they just completed a 19 - 11 May despite some visible chinks in their armor .
For the past 10 days they have put on a Monty Python clinic on how not to run the bases .
First baseman J.T .
Snow and right fielder Stan Javier still haven n't found their strokes , and catcher Brian Johnson is just beginning to rediscover his , as he showed with two solo homers in Sunday 's 7 - 4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks .
If the question is whether the the 33 - 24 Giants are playing as well as they can , manager Dusty Baker would answer with an emphatic `` no. ''
`` In my mind we 're not on a great run yet , '' he said .
`` We 're on a good run , but we could be better . ''
Which is exactly what Baker said when the Giants finished April 14 - 13 .
`` I said all along we were better than how we were playing .
It was just a matter of time before we got some timely hits .
As long as our pitching staff stays intact and we keep away from injuries , the sky 's the limit as far as how high we can go , '' he said .
Short of a complete return to 1997 form by Shawn Estes , it 's hard to imagine the pitching staff being any better than it was in May .
While Orel Hershiser deservedly got most of the ink for his 5 - 0 record and 0.67 ERA , left-hander Kirk Rueter has won four of his past five starts to sneak into a tie for the National League lead in victories with seven .
He threw a six-hitter and allowed one run over seven innings against the Diamondbacks on Sunday .
In his typical praise-others style , Rueter ( 7 - 3 ) insisted it meant little to him sharing the NL victory lead with Pittsburgh 's Jason Schmidt , Houston 's Mike Hampton and the Atlanta quartet of Tom Glavine , Kevin Millwood , Greg Maddux and Denny Neagle , who failed to earn his eighth win last night .
`` I don n't look at that , '' Rueter said .
`` So much goes into getting a win that 's out of my control .
The last time , Bill Mueller hit a three-run homer to put us ahead in the seventh .
Today B.J. gets two home runs to put us ahead when I was losing . ''
Continuing on our tour of the May honor roll , closer Robb Nen started the month with four saves and finished with 14 , leaving him one short of the league lead held by Cincinnati 's Jeff Shaw and San Diego 's Trevor Hoffman .
Although Nen allowed 10 hits during May , he struck out 27 .
But the best performance in May belonged to Barry Bonds : a . 373 average , eight doubles and nine homers among his 37 hits and 30 RBIs .
Yet Bonds was no factor Sunday as the Giants finished the month with their third straight win against Arizona after the D-backs took the series opener .
Johnson led off the third with a homer that tied the game 1 - 1 , then opened the fifth with a much longer blow that put the Giants ahead 2 - 1.
They added three runs in the fifth off Jeff Suppan on singles by Jeff Kent and Javier , an encouraging RBI double from Snow and a two-run bloop single by Rich Aurilia .
They also scored twice in the eighth on a two-error play for a 7 - 1 lead , which became a 7 - 4 final when Arizona scored three runs off Julian Tavarez in the ninth with the aid of two bad-hop hits .
Johnson is on one of his home-run jags , with five in his past five games .
He was struggling at . 193 when he went on the disabled list May 8 with a fractured hand .
Since his return on May 21 he has hit . 323 .
Johnson may have benefited from the mental break as much as his physical recovery .
`` I worked hard on the DL , '' he said .
`` It was a terrible time for me .
I really wasn n't happy with the way I started , compounded with getting hurt .
The team was playing well and I felt left out .
I loafed around a little bit when I was home , but it was a good learning experience for me . ''
May in turn was a good learning experience for the team , which now knows , if there was any doubt before , that it belongs in what promises to be a tough division race .
