& HT ; ( -- -- - Please call or fax for a price quote . ) & HT ; By DEBBI J. KARPOWICZ ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & HT ; Cakes topple .
Drunken relatives fight .
Brides turn out to be allergic to their flowers .
Gowns and tuxes don n't arrive in time .
& HT ; These are some of the mishaps that can beset a wedding , no matter how carefully it is planned .
Even wedding coordinators admit that some things are beyond their control .
& HT ; For example , Phyllis Block , head of the wedding team at The World Trade Center in Boston , once handled a wedding at which the couple 's dog walked down the aisle _ and relieved himself .
& HT ; Toni deLisi , a consultant in Waldwick , N.J . , once planned a wedding at The Plaza Hotel in New York , only to have thieves steal the flowers from the delivery truck parked on Fifth Avenue .
& HT ; Then there are times when things go really awry : Guests have fistfights and get arrested .
An ex-girlfriend sets the limo on fire .
& HT ; If anyone has seen couples get hitched _ with about every hitch possible _ it 's the Rev. Dennis James Robinson , a justice of the peace and Unitarian minister based in Hopkinton , Mass. & HT ; Robinson , who performed 327 weddings in 1997 , once married a couple in a Jacuzzi filled with orange Jell-O .
It involved 72 packets of gelatin , 268 gallons of water and a canoe-paddle stirrer .
& HT ; At one wedding over which Robinson presided , the bride 's divorced parents were on bad terms .
After the groom 's father gave an emotional toast to the newlyweds , the bride 's embittered father grabbed the microphone and launched into a tirade .
& HT ; `` I just wanted to let you all know that my ex-wife is a no-good ! ! % ! % ! , '' he ranted .
Everyone gasped , as he continued , `` I also wanted you all to know that I contributed to this wedding . ''
& HT ; He was interrupted by his ex-wife , who shot back , `` No , you didn n't , you ! ! % ! ''
The ex-wife then jumped up , grabbed her ex-husband 's throat and punched him in the stomach .
& HT ; Meanwhile , the ex-husband 's new girlfriend clawed at the ex-wife with her fingernails , while both reached for the microphone to use as a weapon .
& HT ; The fight eventually spilled out into the parking lot .
When all was said and done , 11 people were arrested .
& HT ; Another time , Robinson officiated at a ceremony on a patio overlooking a golf course .
During the nuptials , he realized there was a ruckus behind him , but he didn n't dare turn around .
When it came time for the bride to say her vows , a breathy voice in back of him yelled , `` I do . ''
& HT ; It was the groom 's ex-girlfriend , decked out in a wedding gown , determined to get revenge .
Pandemonium broke out faster than you can say `` Fatal Attraction . ''
The groom then warned everyone to be careful , as his former flame had recently broken into his house , trashed it and slit his car tires .
& HT ; When the chauffeur left the limousine for a moment , the angry ex took lighter fluid , wrote `` I Love You '' on the hood of the car and set it on fire .
& HT ; `` I left before I heard what happened next , '' Robinson says .
& HT ; Another memorable affair was an Irish wedding at which the budget-conscious couple relied on a relative and a boom box instead of hiring professional musicians .
Unfortunately , Uncle Joe got inebriated and played tunes that were inappropriate , to say the least .
The parents danced to `` Send in the Clowns , '' the newlyweds waltzed to `` The Stripper '' and the groom and his mother danced to `` Do It to Me One More Time . ''
& HT ; Doug Giordano , director of food and beverage at New Jersey 's Woodcliff Lake Hilton , once had a bride who was assaulted by strangers in the restroom .
& HT ; This happened at another hotel , where the ballroom and the bar shared a restroom .
Apparently , three jealous _ and intoxicated _ female customers came upon the happy bride in the bathroom , held her against the wall and burned holes into her gown with their cigarettes .
& HT ; At another wedding that Giordano handled , three rap stars , who had just performed at The Meadowlands , returned to their hotel and , out of boredom , crashed the wedding in the ballroom .
They ran out onto the dance floor and started to sing and dance , Giordano recalls .
When one of the bridesmaids confronted them , it evolved into a fistfight `` with split lips , black eyes and five police cars , '' he says .
& HT ; At least there were no threats of bullets .
Teddy Lenderman , a wedding coordinator in Terre Haute , Ind. , wore a bulletproof vest for one of the weddings she worked on _ as did the priest , groom and several members of the wedding party .
& HT ; Apparently , the groom 's irrational mother didn n't like the bride , and told him , `` If you marry her , I 'm going to come in and blow you all away . ''
& HT ; No one took Mom seriously _ until she showed up at a relative 's funeral , where she slapped the corpse and slammed the casket shut .
When the funeral director approached her , she kicked him and broke his leg in three places .
& HT ; On the day before the wedding , she called the rectory five times and threatened the clergyman with bodily harm .
& HT ; On the wedding day , the nervous groom called his mom and forbade her to come .
& HT ; `` She didn n't show , '' Lenderman says .
`` But in my 14 years of business , at that point , I had never experienced anything so nerve-wracking . ''
& HT ; The bride was the tremulous one t a wedding attended by Barbara Sheehan , an executive at The Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii .
& HT ; Sheehan recalls that the bride got halfway down the aisle , then turned around to ask one of her bridesmaids a question : & HT ; `` You can learn to love someone , can n't you ? ''
