JETS ` FABIO ' WANTS TO BE MATINEE PLAYER ( JT )
By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ The only rookie likely to be a starter among the 12 players the Jets drafted this year is far from being a glamorous figure or major collegiate name .
`` Oh , Fabio , '' called out teammate Lonnie Palelei Monday , trying to sound like a teen-ager calling her idol .
The object of Palelei 's mock derision was Jason Fabini , 6 feet 7 inches , 310 pounds , and trying to get stronger .
He is a fourth-rounder out of a downtown school , Cincinnati , that has little cachet in the National Football League .
But this week Coach Bill Parcells installed Fabini at offensive right tackle in place of the veteran Siupeli Malamala .
But do not read anything into that , Parcells insists .
Fabini hardly impressed scouts with his athleticism .
Indeed , Jet quarterback Vinny Testaverde , one of the most imposing figures on the team , can lift 135 pounds more than Fabini .
But there is something that brings out the football smarts in Fabini .
After the Jets ' player personnel director , Dick Haley , watched Fabini in a game last year , Haley came back the next morning and said : `` I finally saw a football player yesterday .
Forget all the talk about athleticism . ''
Parcells described Fabini Monday as `` probably the fourth guy I 've had with similar capabilities . ''
He was talking about Jumbo Elliott and Doug Riesenberg with the Giants and Max Lane with the Patriots , players who may not have looked good but who performed at a high level .
`` Probably the fact I didn n't do well in the testing for the draft affected my going in the fourth round , '' Fabini said .
`` It had a lot to do with who impresses the scouts . ''
Fabini also had to get stronger .
He came from a weight-lifting program that is different from the way the Jets put on muscle .
The premise in the Jets ' weight room is to train for powerful bursts , not necessarily to have the build of an Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Fabini , who has dropped 10 pounds in camp , gets to test his newly found strength against one of the best pass rushers on Saturday , when the Jets face the Baltimore Ravens .
He will be matched against Peter Boulware , who recorded 11 { sacks as a rookie last year .
`` The thing about Jason is that he 's been well coached , and it shows , '' said the Jets ' offensive line coach , Bill Muir .
`` Some guys are just able to translate their ability to playing football . ''
Fabini 's line coach at Cincinnati was Bob Wylie , who is now with the Bengals as the tight-ends coach .
Meanwhile , Malamala is involved in fewer plays at practice and will probably see less action than Fabini .
Malamala has been in and out as a starter since his rookie year in 1992 and in recent seasons has played sporadically because of a knee injury .
And as Parcells pointed out Monday : `` He 's not the incumbent .
David Williams was our starter there last year . ''
The Jets released Williams on June 1.
Still , Parcells is solicitous of veterans who have played hard , saying , `` I don n't want to beat up Soupy in practice . ''
He also has told Malamala that playing Fabini may not necessarily mean a change .
All that said , Parcells is impressed by Fabini 's intelligence , observing , `` He didn n't make a mental mistake in the game last week , which is unusual for a rookie . ''
Fabini saw significant action in the exhibition opener last Thursday , a victory over the Eagles .
Fabini played left tackle at Cincinnati where , he notes , `` we ran the ball 60 times a game , and the other team knew we were going to . ''
Switching to the right side has not been a problem , he said , `` because I 'm right-handed . ''
`` And , anyway , '' he added , `` I 've been playing football since I was 8 years old . ''
