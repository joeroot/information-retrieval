Medical Employees on Mass Casual Leave in New Delhi
NEW DELHI , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- More than 75,000 medical employees in the Indian capital , New Delhi , went on mass casual leave Monday , affecting health services in government-owned hospitals in the city .
The move was to protest against the non-implementation of an agreement between the government and employees on allowances and promotion .
Co-Convenor of the Joint Council of the Employees Ram Kishan accused the government of going back on the agreement signed on July 28 this year following an eight-day strike .
The council has also threatened to follow the mass casual leave by a 72-hour strike from January 4 next year .
Although five months have passed since the agreement was signed , neither the employees have been provided with the patient care allowance nor have they set up a committee to look into promotional grievances , Kishan said .
At the same time , Delhi Health Minister A. K. Walla indicated that some announcements on the payment of arrears might be made Monday .
