22 Million Nigerian Children Immunized Against
LAGOS , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- About 22 million Nigerians children were immunized against polio this year in this most populous country in Africa , according to Health Minister Debo Adeyemi .
Under the National Program of Immunization ( NPI ) introduced by the Nigerian government in 1997 , the country held two rounds of massive immunization for children on November 4 - 5 and December 9 - 10 , respectively , the official New Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted the minister as saying .
The NPI was initiated to replace the Expanded Program of Immunization sponsored by the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , a global effort to wipe out polio , a disease that often results in paralysis on children .
Official sources said the response level to immunization in Nigeria has shot up to over 90 percent , compared with 15 to 30 percent before the NPI was introduced .
The government had expected that about 25 million children would be immunized during this year 's National Immunization Days .
