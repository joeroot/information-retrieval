Thailand Tackling Delay of New Airport Plan
BANGKOK , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The Thai authorities are seeking ways to deal with a delay in the design of a new airport scheduled to be operational in 2004 , airport sources said Monday .
The state-owned New Bangkok International Airport Company , which runs the Nong Ngu Hao Airport project , has run into trouble with its cooperators , thus resulting in the delay .
The airport company has hired Murphy Jahn / Tams / Act Co. to design the airport 's passenger terminal , but Murphy Jahn / Tams / Act Co. faces a problem of cooperation with the airport project 's consulting firm -- the General Engineering Consultant Co.
Due to the delay , Murphy Jahn / Tams / Act Co. can not seek payments from the airport company so it has to shoulder more costs , said the sources .
Despite 30-percent completion of extensive and costly site preparations , the airport might not be completed as scheduled , the sources said .
Initiated in 1960 , the airport had been " on and off " the agenda under the successive governments .
In 1992 , Chuan Leekpai 's first administration made a determined bid to go ahead with the project , but only to see his successor Chavalit Yongchaiyudh move the location from Nong Ngu Hao to Nakhon Pathom or Nakhon Nayok on the suburbs of Bangkok .
Since the new location drew criticism , the Chavalit government agreed to keep Nong Ngu Hao , east of Bangkok , as the site .
When Chuan Leekpai regained power last November , his government restored the Nong Ngu Hao project in full .
" At this stage , the project has gone far beyond the stage where suspension or relocation can be considered .
The government has already invested more than 2.5 billion baht ( 625 million U.S. dollars ) in Nong Ngu Hao .
We can not abandon it and restart elsewhere , " said Pradit Phatraprasit , deputy transport and communications minister , who supervises the project .
He said work might be completed slightly behind schedule because the economic crisis has trimmed state spending .
The solution to finding finance for airport work would be to privatize international airports nationwide , he said .
Four companies would be established to operate the country 's international airports as part of a government plan to speed up the privatization process as well as construction of the new airport to meet the 2004 deadline , Pradit said .
This needed a strong management team for the project , he said .
