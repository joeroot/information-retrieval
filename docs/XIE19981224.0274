Cyprus Considers U.N. Resolutions Positive
NICOSIA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The government of Cyprus views as positive U.N. Security Council resolutions 1217 and 1218 concerning efforts to solve disputes between Turkish and Greek Cypriots on the island , Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said on Wednesday .
In its late Tuesday session , the U.N. Security Council passed resolution 1217 renewing the madate of the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and resolution 1218 prolonging U.N Secretary General Kofi Annan 's good offices mission in Cyprus .
Kasoulides told reporters the government stance is based on its belief that the resolutions have created some hopeful prospects regarding efforts to open the road on the core issues of the Cyprus problem , especially the reduction of all armaments with an aim to the demilitarization of the island .
On U.N. Resolution 1217 , Kasoulides welcomed the reaffirmation that " a Cyprus settlement must be based on a single citizenship , with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded and comprising two politically equal communities as described in the relevant Security Council resolutions , in a bicommunal and bizonal federation " .
Regarding the Resolution 1218 , Kasoulides noted that the Security Council requests the U.N. chief to work intensively with the two sides for a settlement in Cyprus and the reduction of arms .
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia .
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue reached a stalemate after the Turkish Cypriot side demanded recognition of " the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " , unilaterally declared in 1983 and recognized only by Ankara .
" This is the first time in many years that the Security Council demands compliance with its previous resolutions on Cyprus , particularly with regard to refraining from the threat or the use of force , and on the reduction of troops and armaments , " Kasoulides said .
On a statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton in support of the resolutions , Kasoulides said " it creates some new hopes for 1999 " .
Kasoulides did not comment on the issue of the S-300 missiles , saying it will be discussed Thursday at a meeting of the National Council , the top advisory body to the President on the Cyprus issue .
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense , a move rejected by Turkey which has threatened to launch preemptive strike on the missiles if they are deployed .
The Cyprus government has said it would reconsider its decision to deploy the missiles if substantive negotiations on the Cyprus issue get underway or if talks on the reduction of tension and arms , leading to demilitarization , are on track .
