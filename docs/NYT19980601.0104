The ruins of crony banks and businesses built on corruption and special favors litter the devastated economies of Southeast Asia , making it easy to notice what the region 's leaders did wrong .
But buried under the rubble are a number of things that these societies did right _ steps they took , or societal strengths they preserved , that may soften the trauma of the economic crisis they are going through .
These are characteristics largely unmatched by Latin American , African and South Asian nations like India and Pakistan .
And they may well serve as a cushion on which the societies of Southeast Asia can bounce back once the economic panic recedes .
Jean-Michel Severino , the World Bank 's vice president for East Asia and the Pacific , cites three major achievements .
The most obvious is `` the good macroeconomic management that prevailed in the region for 20 , 30 years _ tight monetary policy , no fiscal deficits , a kind of caution in the way public affairs were run , '' he said .
`` Unlike the Latin American countries , this will be the cushion that will allow them to absorb better the costs of financial restructuring . ''
Second was the `` outward looking '' character of many of the region 's economies , which took to the export trade with alacrity .
Even though trade within Asia has crashed for now , they do not need to learn how to live in a global market .
Finally , Severino cited `` the tremendous investment they have made in education '' and the quality of economic , business and government management it has produced .
Ever since Southeast Asia 's economic crisis began with a meltdown of Thailand 's banking system last summer , it has been tempting to envision economic catastrophe followed by uncontrollable political turmoil .
The forced resignation of Indonesia 's President Suharto strengthens that impression .
Last week , tens of thousands of South Korean workers went on strike to protest layoffs even as Hong Kong 's stock market plunged 5.3 percent and economists talked of a `` contagion '' that has now helped undermine Russia 's financial reserves .
But what if the economic slide can be halted ?
Is there a base on which recovery might be easily built , making political stability more likely ?
A number of experts think there is .
Take education .
By the mid 1990s , nearly all of Southeast Asian children of primary age were in school , and college enrollment rates were considerably higher than in the India-Pakistan area _ as was literacy , especially among women .
And the people of Indonesia , the Philippines , Thailand , Malaysia and Singapore had at least twice _ in some cases 60 times _ as much income per capita .
Led by Thailand , several Southeast Asian nations have also cut birth rates substantially by making safe family planning methods readily available to most ordinary people .
James H. Nolt , assistant professor of political science at the New School and senior fellow at the World Policy Institute in New York , said educational investment has produced not only managers and competent public officials but also a large pool of skilled engineers and technicians .
`` These gains will survive the economic crisis and allow these countries to be competitive producers again , '' he said .
And with such educated managerial and middle classes , he said , `` the old forms of political rule are more subject to challenge than they might have been in a more traditional , agriculture-based society . ''
The evolution of politics toward multi-party democracy has been most striking in Thailand , traditionally a self-contained monarchy .
John Bresnan , a senior research scholar at Columbia University 's East Asian Institute , said Thailand `` has had enormous success in the last nine months , '' having headed off martial law , adopted a new constitution , changed governments , removed the head of the central bank and recovered some economic ground .
Noeleen Heyzer , a Singaporean who is executive director of Unifem , the United Nations development program for women , says educational spending _ 20 percent or more of the budget in some countries _ did not bypass the grass roots , as it did in many other regions .
She pointed to rural education in Malaysia , which lured American and other computer giants to provide the kinds of jobs that would bring social development .
Visitors to the country 's free trade zone on Penang Island a decade ago , for example , could see demure Muslim women in head scarves at work on circuit boards .
`` You had women and men who were able to build up strong economic assets , '' Ms. Heyzer said .
`` And in introducing the idea of computers to rural women , a mind-set was changed .
So when you get information technology , it is not something dramatically new . ''
Meanwhile , she said , Singapore was moving `` from a trading center to a labor-intensive industrial structure to a more high-tech economy and eventually to service-information technology . ''
Singapore , under the socially visionary but politically intolerant Lee Kuan Yew , took another step not emulated by its Asian neighbors .
It sought to eliminate corruption _ `` Asian business practices , '' they were called _ which sapped the strength and spirit of Thailand , the Philippines , Indonesia and Vietnam .
Nihal Jayawikrama , executive director of Transparency International , a private group based in Berlin that fights corruption worldwide , said that both Singapore and Hong Kong tackled corruption in ways his organization would not advocate _ by fiat rather than through the natural cleansing process of open elections , a strong and independent judiciary and a free press .
`` But I think the fact that the currencies of those two countries were affected least last year seems to suggest that there is a link between corruption and economic crisis , '' he said .
Southeast Asia has a lot of other unfinished business , most experts agree .
The specter of racial attacks on wealthy Chinese minorities who have had important economic roles hang over Indonesia and to a lesser extent Malaysia , where laws that give native Malays economic privileges are now being rethought .
Everywhere social services are weak , the poor are often without health care and the unemployed have no source of compensation .
The relative equality and mobility of women has often led them into exploitation in the sex industry or domestic servitude .
And traditional family support systems are under stress in rapidly industrializing and urbanizing economies .
Still , the foundations of the economic miracle remain , said Severino of the World Bank .
`` They are the rocks on which we can build hope for the recovery of the region . ''
