Afforestation Improves Tibet 's Ecological Surroundings
LHASA , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- A decade-long afforestation drive has improved the ecological surroundings in southwest China 's Tibet Autonomous Region , according to the regional forestry department .
More than 50,000 hectares of land have been covered with trees , and a 400-hectare nursery has been planted , improving the surroundings over a previously desert area of 20,000 hectares .
With scant precipitation and high , rugged terrain , the region is hostile to the growth of trees .
Governments at all levels have offered both financial and policy support to the afforestation drive , and local people have participated in the drive spontaneously .
According to statistics , Tibetans have volunteered to plant more than 80,000 trees .
More than 85 percent of the farmland in Xigaze city is dotted with shelter forests , which protect farmland from sand storms , and about 3,000-hectares of afforested land grow trees for harvesting , bringing economic gain to local farmers .
