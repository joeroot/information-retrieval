U.S. GDP Grows at 3.7 Percent in Third Quarter
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. economy expanded less strongly during the July-September quarter than previously estimated because of a slightly worse trade performance , the Commerce Department said on Wednesday .
The nation 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate during the third quarter instead of the 3.9 percent forecasted a month ago , the Department said , but still more than twice the second quarter 's 1.8 percent rate of advance .
Price rises remained muted , suggesting little or no inflation pressure .
It reported that the trade problems linked to the world economic slump was largely responsible for the modest downward revision in overall GDP growth .
It is the first time in 40 years that the U.S. export sales fell for a third consecutive quarter .
They were down at a 2.8 percent annual rate over the July-September period , while imports from abroad rose at a 2.3 percent rate .
U.S. corporations are being squeezed by the loss of sales abroad and their inability to raise prices at home .
After-tax profits fell 1 percent in the third quarter , the third decline in the past four quarters .
However , during the third quarter , consumer spending advanced at a rapid 4.1 percent annual rate and housing construction soared at a 9.9 percent annual rate .
That helped offset the deteriorating trade deficit and a drop in business investment in new equipment at a 1 percent annual rate , the first decline since 1991 .
Economists said that growth is expected to remain brisk during the fourth quarter , mainly because of strong consumer spending , but slow next year as weak sales to overseas markets .
