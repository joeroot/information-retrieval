Philippines Presses For Miyazawa Funding for PAL
MANILA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- The Philippines has formally requested the Japanese government to help bail out the ailing Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) through the Miyazawa Initiative , the Philippine Star newspaper said Monday .
The Department of Finance of the Philippines proposed the grant of a loan of 150 million U.S. dollars under the Miyazawa Fund through the Japan Export-Import Bank to finance PAL 's rehabilitation , the newspaper said .
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu earlier raised the possibility of another PAL 's shutdown if his government failed to obtain financial assistance for the flag carrier .
He said that the Japanese government still has to send words if it is amenable to the proposal .
He said the aid falls under the objective of Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to help ailing firms struck by the Asian financial crisis .
The Philippines expects to get at least 3 billion dollars from the Miyazawa Fund of 30 billion dollars for crisis-hit Asian economies .
The 57-year-old PAL grounded its local and domestic planes for two weeks starting September 23 this year , weighed down by a 2.1-billion-dollar debt aggravated by a crippling 22-day pilots ' strike in June .
