Until quite recently titles like Donald Bartlett and James Steele 's `` America : What Went Wrong ? ''
typified commentary about the U.S. economy , and economic journalism was dominated by scare headlines about downsizing .
But now , after a mere two years of good news America 's mood has become startlingly triumphalist .
In the view of many business and political leaders America has entered the era of the New Economy , in which traditional limits to economic expansion are no longer relevant .
Because America has a New Economy and the rest of the world does not , it supposedly is once more indisputably No. 1 , and the rest of the world must adopt its values and emulate its institutions if it wants to compete .
To anyone with a sense of history , this is deeply worrying .
If pride goeth before a fall , the United States has one heck of a comeuppance in store .
What of our so-called New Economy ?
America has had a favorable turn in the business cycle , abetted by some temporary factors that have helped keep inflation down , and probably also by shifts in the labor market that have reduced the bargaining power of workers and therefore allowed fuller employment without accelerating wage increases .
But the New Economy actually looks a lot like the Old Economy .
It has about the same long-run growth rate but can run at slightly lower unemployment .
Things could be worse , but nothing fundamental has changed _ the amount of good news is not enough to justify the triumphant rhetoric one now hears so often .
Why , if the U.S. economy is not doing as well as advertised , do we have the sense of renewed American preeminence ?
One answer may be that other economies _ in Europe and in Asia _ have fallen short .
In a world of stagnation and crisis , a country that continues to make even modest progress may be entitled to some self-satisfaction .
There is no question that much of the world has disappointed expectations that were widely held only a few years ago .
The days when the economist Lester Thurow could confidently predict , `` Over the next five years Europe will move to full employment , '' and the journalist James Fallows could declare , in the January 1994 Atlantic Monthly , `` Like it or not , we live in the world that Asian success stories have shaped .
We need to figure out how to compete in it , '' seem distant now .
But just as pronouncements of American triumph turn out , on close examination , to be overstated , so do the dismissals of European and Asian prospects that one now hears .
To be sure , compared with the optimism that prevailed at the beginning of this decade , Europe 's economic performance has been a huge disappointment .
Particularly distressing to those who place their faith in European unity has been the failure of measures aimed at reinforcing that unity _ the creation of a single market , the drive toward a common currency _ to jump-start the continent 's economy .
A good case can even be made that the efforts of European countries to meet the criteria for entry into the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) at the end of this year have actually aggravated the problems of slow growth and unemployment .
Will the achievement of EMU transform the situation ?
Almost surely not .
There has been a massive and occasionally bitter debate over whether on economic grounds Europe really should have a single currency .
EMU advocates have failed to make a convincing case for large gains , but EMU opponents have also failed to make a conclusive case for large losses .
One thing that seems clear , however , is that establishing a single currency will have little if any impact on Eurosclerosis .
The forces that keep unemployment high and job creation low will be as strong on Jan. 2 of next year as they are today .
My own amateur prediction is that this persistence will lead to a period of great political disillusionment .
Having spent many years suffering under the disciplines of the Maastricht treaty , Europe will arrive at the promised land and find that it looks an awful lot like the desert .
That said , in some respects the European economy continues to show considerable resilience .
Given the general sense that the United States has once again seized the technological high ground , it is surprising to learn that the already small gap in productivity between the United States and advanced European countries has continued to narrow during this decade .
The United States has taken more rapidly to the Internet and e-mail than most European countries , largely because of low telephone charges , although the most wired country in the world is , surprisingly , not the United States but Finland .
Europeans , on the other hand , have technologically superior cellular phones .
Which matters more for business ?
Never mind ; the point is that Europe and the United States are operating at essentially the same technological level , with each side of the Atlantic having a small edge in some things .
Europe , in short , has a poorly functioning labor market , as it has for the past generation , and as a result has a dreary employment picture .
But on other fronts the gap between Europe and the United States has narrowed or vanished , not widened .
The only sense in which Europe has fallen behind is its failure to live up to unrealistic Europhile expectations .
As to Asia , however , rarely in the course of economic events has a region 's reputation suffered as severe a reversal as that of its emerging economies since last summer .
Events are now moving too quickly to be sure how far and deep Asia 's crisis will reach , although it has already exceeded anyone 's worst expectations .
The best available diagnosis of the crisis is that it was made possible by runaway Asian financial institutions that in effect gambled with other people 's money .
The inevitable failure of many of them was hastened and reinforced by a circular process in which collapsing asset values undermined banks .
An imploding banking system not only further depressed asset values but disrupted the normal functioning of business .
Meanwhile , foreign investors , whose excessive optimism had helped create the bubble , ran for the exits .
The success of International Monetary Fund-sponsored stabilization plans is still in the balance .
While the scene has been astonishingly grim , however , Asia 's present failures need to be viewed with as much perspective as its past successes .
An economy may suffer a severe financial crisis , then recover and grow as rapidly as ever .
In fact , the susceptibility of an economy to financial crises and its ability to deliver sustained growth in general have little to do with each other .
Consider that the U.S. economy between the Civil War and World War I was notoriously crisis-prone .
Nor were catastrophes like the Panic of 1873 pure accidents .
They were made much more likely by a business and political culture in which petty things like scrupulous accounting were disdained and wholesale corruption was a matter of course .
So too , many business empires were built on the strength not so much of productive efficiency as of political connections .
Yet despite a steady stream of scandals and the occasional devastating panic , the United States rose over those years to the position of economic preeminence that it now , rather prematurely , claims to have recaptured .
In short , emerging Asia will be back .
None of this is meant to suggest that the United States is in any sense on the verge of crisis ; its economy does seem fundamentally sound .
But the current sense that the United States is on top of the world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few good years here and a few bad years elsewhere .
Let there be even a mild recession in the United States , a moderate recovery in Europe and Japan and a rebound in emerging Asia , and talk of the return of American dominance will start to sound silly indeed .
Future historians will not record that the 21st century belonged to the United States .
