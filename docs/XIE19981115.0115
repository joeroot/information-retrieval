Zambia to Check Importation
LUSAKA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Zambian government is concerned about the amount of imported finished goods in the country and is working out measures to arrest the situation .
This was disclosed Saturday by Jazzman Chikwakwa , Deputy Minister of Commerce and Industry , when he was speaking at the commissioning of a tyre retreading plant in Ndola , capital of Copperbelt Province .
Zambia Daily Mail Sunday quoted the deputy minister as saying the government is worried that subsidize finished goods from abroad are putting the local manufacturers at a disadvantage .
He pledged that the government is acting to give the Zambian manufacturing sector a fair production deal .
Meanwhile , the government has been urged to either ban " dumped goods " to come from abroad or give the local industries the short term protective support required .
A spokesman from Amanita Premier Oils Limited , a local edible oil producer , expressed his concern over the importation of cheap Zimbabwean goods .
He told the paper Saturday that Zambia 's edible oil and feed cake industries are now struggling to compete against Zimbabwean goods which he said are arriving in the country at price levels that do not make economic sense .
The spokesman complained that the low priced goods are causing serious problems for local manufacturers with large quantities of Zambian produced raw materials such as cotton seed , sunflower and soybeans .
