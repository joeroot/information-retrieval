O ' DONNELL 'S DAYS AS JET ARE AT AN END , AGENT BELIEVES ( JT )
By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
CLIFTON , N.J .
_ Neil O ' Donnell 's brief , bizarre run as quarterback of the Jets has ended .
His agent , Leigh Steinberg , came to that conclusion Tuesday night after receiving an unexpected phone call from Bill Parcells .
`` Bill called me and said that because of Neil 's unwillingness to restructure his contract , he is talking to and pursuing other quarterbacks , which could result in Neil 's release , '' a surprised Steinberg said .
One of them could be Vinny Testaverde , who grew up on Long Island wanting to be a Jet .
The 34-year-old Testaverde , who was cut by the Baltimore Ravens , said Tuesday his agent `` just two days ago '' started talks with the Jets .
When asked about Testaverde 's remarks , Parcells said , `` We 've had some talks with Vinny Testaverde and his representatives . ''
For now , Glenn Foley is the No. 1 quarterback , which he held for two games during 1997 before suffering a season-ending knee injury .
But Testaverde is good enough to give Foley a battle for the starting job during training camp .
Last season Testaverde produced 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions while completing 57.7 percent of his passes .
That followed his best season in 1996 , when he went to the Pro Bowl while generating 33 touchdowns and 4,177 yards with only 19 interceptions .
But in the offseason , the Ravens traded for the Colts ' Jim Harbaugh , and cut Testaverde .
Parcells has been attempting since January to induce O ' Donnell to restructure the $ 4.2 million salary he was to earn this year .
O ' Donnell has steadfastly refused .
Even after he is cut , though , the Jets will still be charged $ 2.8 million against this year 's salary cap.
`` Neil has understood for some time there 's been a difference of opinion .
But he was hoping his tenure would be much longer , '' Steinberg said .
O ' Donnell joined the Jets in 1996 , shortly after leading the Steelers to the Super Bowl .
He signed a five-year deal worth a potential $ 25 million .
But in the first year he suffered a shoulder tear after six games .
And when he was finally ready to return , he went into a routine backpedal in practice-and tore his calf .
Last year he was benched in consecutive weeks and replaced by Foley , who eventually became the starter after leading the club to victory as a back-up .
Foley himself was injured , though , and O ' Donnell returned to lead the Jets the final five games .
Still , Parcells , who has been reserved in praising O ' Donnell , felt he was overpaid and told him not to attend the recent offseason workout that the coach demands of every other player .
The stated reason was that if O ' Donnell were injured , the club might be responsible for his salary .
O ' Donnell 's last game as a Jet steeled his resolve when he didn n't take the fall for a 13 - 10 loss to the Lions in the regular-season finale that cost New York a playoff berth .
He was lifted several times for trick plays by the mobile Ray Lucas and Leon Johnson , each of whom threw interceptions .
Afterward , O ' Donnell told friends `` they can n't pin that loss on me . ''
Testaverde , meanwhile , seemed reluctant Tuesday to say that there was a good chance he would be a Jet .
`` Certainly if I had a chance to play for Bill Parcells , that would be a great opportunity for me , knowing his past in taking teams to the Super Bowl , '' said Testaverde .
Parcells ' phone call surprised Steinberg , who also represents Foley .
Just a few hours earlier , Steinberg had contended , `` It 's been pretty clear to me the entire offseason that Neil O ' Donnell is coming back .
`` My assumption is that the quarterbacks of the New York Jets will be Glenn Foley and Neil O ' Donnell and someone who 's third . ''
Speaking during a practice round for the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic , which begins Wednesday , Testaverde said he would not discount the possibility of being a backup , `` if the club has a good defense and seems to be going somewhere . ''
Until recently , Jets ' insiders had been saying that Parcells had no interest in Testaverde .
However , there doesn n't appear to be another quarterback out there .
And it doesn n't seem likely Parcells is willing to go with his untested third-stringers , Ray Lucas or Chuck Clements .
In his career , Testaverde has completed 55.1 percent of his passes , thrown for 29,223 yards , and tossed 175 touchdowns to 183 interceptions .
`` I played well when I was under Bill Belichick in Cleveland , '' said Testaverde , referring to Parcells ' second-in-command .
The quarterback , who grew up in Elmont , N.Y . , added , `` Me being from Long Island , I 'd be coming home . ''
