THIS BULLS TRIUMPH WAS PREORDAINED
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By KAREN CROUSE c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES _ It was after an NBA playoff game in 1986 that Larry Bird talked about God being disguised as Michael Jordan .
Jordan had just scored 63 points for the Chicago Bulls in a loss to Bird and the rest of the Boston Celtics .
Twelve years later , Bird was back and so was God , this time with nine disciples in tow .
By late Sunday , the crusaders otherwise known as the Chicago Bulls had made believers out of Bird and his Indiana Pacers and anyone who had doubted them .
After turning back the Pacers 88 - 83 in a stirring seventh and final game in their Eastern Conference finals , the Bulls ' claim to a sixth NBA title suddenly doesn n't seem the least bit blasphemous .
Like a latter-day Elijah , Jordan predicted the outcome , then made it happen by going out and collecting 28 points , nine rebounds and eight assists .
He couldn n't have done it without his teammates , who provided the support that was too often lacking in the first few years of Jordan 's ascension .
Make no mistake about it ; the Bulls are four wins away from a third straight NBA title because they have not only the best player in the game but one heckuva team .
With apologies to the Utah Jazz , the Bulls ' front office may be the only ones capable of stopping these Bulls .
Indeed , leave it to the Jerrys to put the nasty in dynasty .
Jerry Krause , the Bulls ' vice president of basketball operations , and team chairman Jerry Reinsdorf hold the future of the franchise in their hands and they seem eminently capable of dribbling it off their feet .
Free-agent-to-be Scottie Pippen already has been rumored to have checked out real estate in Phoenix , having concluded the Bulls aren n't going to meet his market price .
If Reinsdorf can open the vault for the White Sox 's Albert Belle , why not Pippen , who proved his worth again on Sunday by marking Mark Jackson on defense and keeping the Bulls close early while Jordan was struggling to find his rhythm ?
Pippen accounted for nine of the Bulls ' 19 points in the opening 12 minutes on his way to 17 and a team-high 12 rebounds .
It hasn n't always been easy , playing second fiddle to a one-man symphony orchestra , but Pippen has persevered for 11 years and all the Bulls have prospered , none more so than Jordan .
Left to do it all his first few years in the league , Jordan put up wondrous numbers _ like those 63 points against Bird 's Celtics _ but the Bulls collectively were no match for the likes of the Celtics or the Detroit Pistons .
In the four seasons leading up to the Bulls ' first NBA championship appearance , in 1991 , Jordan accounted for nearly one-third of Chicago 's scoring .
His 28 points on Sunday represented 31.8 percent of the Bulls ' total but didn n't begin to tell the whole story of the seventh-game success .
The Bulls would be scattering like last year 's Florida Marlins if not for the rebounding and sheer energy of forward Dennis Rodman .
The first time he checked into the game , the Bulls were trailing by 13 points and looking flatter than a casino chip .
The Bulls proceeded to cash in on Rodman 's boundless energy , drawing to within six .
When the first quarter ended , the Bulls still were down , 27 - 19 , but they no longer looked tentative and tense .
The Bulls would be as dead as the U.S. men at the French Open if not for guard Toni Kukoc , who was 5 for 5 from the field in the third quarter and collected 14 points in that 12-minute span .
The Bulls would be as passe as the Lakers ' Showtime era that Jordan and his teammates had ushered out in 1991 if not for the performance down the stretch of supporting cast members Luc Longley , Steve Kerr and Ron Harper .
More than once in the final minutes , Jordan drew double coverage and found his teammates , entrusting them with the ball , yes , but also with all that was riding on the game 's outcome .
They rewarded his faith in them by keeping alive his legacy and quite possibly his career .
Jordan had all but assured a victory on the eve of the game , explaining that the team had a confidence `` we 've built over time in pressure situations . ''
To a man , the Bulls came through in the clutch , which is why Jordan today is at the gates of his heaven on Earth .
