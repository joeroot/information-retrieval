China Simplifies Protocol Arrangements for Leaders ' Visit Abroad
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- China has decided to simplify , as of today , protocol arrangements for seeing off and greeting the country 's Communist Party and state leaders on their visits abroad .
The decision , which was made by the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) Central Committee and the State Council , said the send-off and welcoming ceremonies for China 's top Party and state leaders will be held at the Great Hall of the People , and the number of senior officials attending these ceremonies will be reduced accordingly .
When lower-ranking Party and state leaders go abroad on visits or return home from visits , they will be seen off or greeted by officials from relevant departments only , the decision said .
The send-off or welcoming ceremonies were once held at the airport .
And in recent years , such ceremonies were held at the Great Hall of the People , but with many leaders and officials present on the occasion .
