A HEAVY REGULATORY PRESENCE IN NEW YORK
( With BOXING-REVIVE ) ( bb ) By KIRK JOHNSON c.1998 N.Y .

PORT CHESTER , N.Y .
_ Compared with small boxing events in other parts of the country , the fights held here in April at the Capitol Theater looked like a police officers ' convention .
Clumps of men in sport coats with badges and New York State Athletic Commission emblems guarded the dressing-room doors .
Corner inspectors in surgical gloves leaned over the ropes to monitor the fighters and their trainers between rounds , and were rotated at the bell , with a new inspection team for each bout .
That level of regulatory presence would be unthinkable in many states .
But whether it is zealous , invaluable attention to fighter safety or wasteful extravagance is a question central to the debate about what New York taxpayers get for their money in boxing regulation .
Over the years , the state athletic commission has been criticized as a political patronage operation .
Some boxing experts have recently questioned the credentials of the commission 's doctors .
`` The commission has always been a dumping ground , '' said one former senior New York boxing regulator , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Still , when compared with other states , New York clearly requires more medical screening of fighters and operates with a budget that dwarfs those elsewhere .
The commission 's budget , which was seriously cut during the economic recession in New York in the early 1990s , has ballooned since , despite no growth in the number of events .
In 1992 , for example , the commission spent $ 494,800 to regulate 31 boxing shows .
Last year it spent $ 841,000 to oversee 30 .
A spokesman for the commission , Scott Trent , said most of the spending increases were due to staff salaries being restored to their former levels .
But spending on supplies , materials , medical testing , travel and equipment purchases grew as well , according to commission budget documents .
Most noticeably , the question of just how serious an operation the commission is was underscored with the appointment of Floyd Patterson as chairman in 1995 .
The two-time heavyweight world champion , who is 63 , has memory problems .
He resigned in March , but had long been regarded within the sport as a $ 76,000-a-year figurehead .
`` He was warm , friendly and hospitable , but I knew very rapidly that he was not really running the show , '' said Stanley Levin , an attorney and promoter for Roy Jones Jr. , a super middleweight who fought in New York in 1996 .
New York places more demands on fighters and promoters than most states do , in both medical tests and fees .
The state requires each fighter to get a CAT brain scan , as well as an electrocardiogram and an EKG once a year .
It also collects a 5.5 percent tax on tickets and a . 55 percent tax on television rights .
And boxers generally have to be in the state for several days before their fights .
But even promoters who have been critical of New York say that putting the state in a national context is crucial .
`` There are some commissions that are putrid , terrible , '' said Mike Boorman , a spokesman for Main Events , a large boxing promoter based in Totowa , N.J .
`` If you did a bell curve , New York would get an A. ''
