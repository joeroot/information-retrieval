Employees Vote on Fate of Philippine Airlines
MANILA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The Philippine government Monday conducted a nationwide referendum among members of the Philippine Airlines Employees Association ( PALEA ) to decide the fate of the debt-ridden airlines .
Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said a committee has been formed to directly supervise the referendum , widely seen as the last-ditch effort to save the moribund Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) .
Laguesma said he is still hopeful that the PAL management and its union leaders would arrive at an acceptable solution to their dispute .
PAL announced last Friday that it will shut down Wednesday since its rebuilding efforts were no longer viable following the union 's refusal to accept a management proposed rescue plan .
Labor officials said the referendum will allow PALEA members to vote on whether or not the workers should agree to a management-proposed rescue plan .
Under the management proposal , PALEA members would receive a 20 - percent share in the company in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining agreement ( CBA ) , as well as three seats in the 15-member board .
Each worker would get some 60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000 pesos ( 6,976 U.S. dollars at current rate ) .
