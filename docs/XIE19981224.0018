And its unique tropical landscape is a boon for the tourist industry , with both sectors useful for attracting and developing high-tech industries , the premier added .

As an example he cited the real estate fever which occurred in Hainan and other places in the country some years ago and pointed to the huge financial losses because of a lack of planning , .
Zhu said that the Hainan provincial government must make an overall plan scientifically , taking into account the need for infrastructure construction including roads , railways and communications .
