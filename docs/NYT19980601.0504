HOUSTON _ Astronaut-trainee John Glenn joined the rest of his space crew Monday in a half-day training session on emergency evacuations from the space shuttle .
Glenn , Ohio 's senior senator and NASA 's senior space man , practiced rappelling down the sides of a shuttle mockup in a drill designed to hone crew coordination in the event of an emergency after a successful landing .
The crew members had done these same exercises individually , but Monday was the first time they worked together .
`` It 's a little different every time you do it , '' Glenn , 76 , said during the three evacuation drills .
For the training , each astronaut wore a bright orange flight suit similar to the ones they 'll wear during the 9-day mission scheduled to begin October 29 .
The suit weighs about 100 pounds and includes an array of survival essentials from a built-in life raft with dye pack to 2 liters of drinking water , a flare kit , radio and parachute .
`` Very nice , '' trainer Sharon Jones told the crew when they 'd finished the drill that involved exiting through an escape hatch at the top of the craft .
The hatch is directly above the flight and mid decks , where crew members sit during takeoff and landing .
But Flight Commander Curt Brown , who has flown four space shuttle missions and has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space , gently admonished his crew to step lively next time .
`` Today was training , and everybody did great , '' Brown said , but added , `` We could speed it up a little . ''
As Glenn did his chores , his wife , Annie , roamed about with a camera happily taking snapshots of the crew .
Ever enthusiastic , Glenn pulled at the fingers of his pressure-suit glove before he put it on to fashion a thumb 's - up sign to Annie , who grinned and took the picture .
Glenn returned to Washington Monday afternoon , having spent all of last week here in astronaut training .
He said he 's planning to fly to Arizona later this week to attend a funeral for former Sen. Barry Goldwater , who died last week at 89 .
`` We want to go , '' Glenn said , speaking also for his wife .
`` ( Goldwater ) and I worked pretty closely for a while on the Armed Services Committee .
