Malaysia Revises Levy Rates on Foreign Workers
KUALA LUMPUR , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Malaysia Monday announced a revision of levy rates on foreign workers effective from January 1 , 1999 .
The rates for sectors such as export-oriented manufacturing and construction in Peninsular Malaysia are reduced to 1,200 ringgit ( 316 U.S. dollars ) a year from the present 1,500 ringgit ( 395 dollars ) , Deputy Home Minister Mohamed Tajol Rosli Ghazali said Monday .
Meanwhile , in Sabah , Sarawak and Labuan , East Malaysia , the foreign workers levy for the sectors is cut to 960 ringgit ( 253 dollars ) a year from the present 1,500 ringgit ( 395 dollars ) .
However , the revised rates will not cover the two sectors of domestic help and plantations , where there are a large number of foreign workers and the levy is maintained at 360 ringgit ( 95 dollars ) a year , the deputy minister announced in a statement issued here .
The reduced levy rates will benefit more than 1 million foreign workers in the country and their employers , he said .
The foreign workers in Malaysia are mostly from Indonesia , Bangladesh and the Philippines .
Tajol Rosli said the decision to revise the rates was made following appeals to the government by employers and foreign workers for help in view of the current economic crisis .
He said the government has also agreed to categorize activities in agriculture , animal rearing , fisheries , logging , mining and quarrying in the plantations sector .
