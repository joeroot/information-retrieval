Cambodia Forms New Government
PHNOM PENH , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Cambodia 's new government was formed Monday after the National Assembly approved the new political platform and a cabinet led by new Prime Minister Hun Sen.
The new government was endorsed with 99 votes for , 13 against and three abstentions while one vote was declared invalid .
One hundred and sixteen out of the 122 parliamentarians participated in the confidence vote .
Hun Sen , nominated by his Cambodian People 's Party for the sole premiership , was named new prime minister by King Norodom Sihanouk last Wednesday night and appointed to form a new government .
Hun Sen , who has been prime minister since 1985 , will lead a new coalition of two major political parties for a five-year term .
Monday 's vote for the legitimacy of the new government brought an end to nearly 17 months of political uncertainty caused by the ouster of first prime minister Prince Ranariddh in July last year .
The ruling Cambodian People 's Party ( CPP ) holds 12 ministers among 25 ministries while FUNCINPEC of Prince Ranariddh gains 11 .
The two key ministries of defense and interior still have co-ministers .
