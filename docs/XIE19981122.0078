Inflation in India Rises to 8.85 Percent
NEW DELHI , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- India 's annual rate of inflation rose to a 163-week high of 8.85 percent for the week ending November 7 on sustained increase in prices of primary food articles , official sources said here Sunday .
This is the highest rate of inflation based on wholesale price index ( WPI ) recorded since September 23 , 1995 .
During the week under reference , inflation rose by 0.34 percentage points to 8.85 percent from 8.51 percent in the previous week .
The increase in inflation is mainly on account of primary food articles , especially essential commodities .
In the last few months , commodities like onion , potato , pulses and edible oils have witnessed an unprecedented rise in prices .
Rise in prices of items like onion and potato does not get properly reflected in WPI as these commodities carry only very small weightages in the all commodities basket , the sources said .
