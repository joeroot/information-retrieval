GUANGZHOU , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Li Peng , chairman of China 's National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , says that China 's securities market is a major part of the socialist market economy and should be controlled by laws to maintain its healthy development and serve economic construction .
Li visited Shenzhen in Guangdong Province , November 15 - 18 , to study the country 's fledgling securities sector .
He presided over two discussions in Shenzhen attended by local securities specialists and researchers .
Li says he agrees that the securities market has played a positive role in raising public funds , improving use of resources , adjusting the economic structure , transforming the management of state enterprises , and developing the national economy .
One of the lessons China has learned from the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia , he said , is the importance of avoiding financial hazards and learning how to protect China .
He said that the securities market is highly volatile and asked that there be greater controls .
China opened the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1990 and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 1991 .
Over 800 companies have been listed on the two , with capitalization of more than 2 trillion yuan .
Since 1993 , the NPC Standing Committee has held hearings on a law for the securities market four times .
