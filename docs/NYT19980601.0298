UGLY BLOCS OUTSIDE WHITE HOUSE HAVE THEIR ADMIRERS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By DAVID L. MARCUS c.1998 The Boston Globe
WASHINGTON _ The real scandal in Washington isn n't inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue _ it 's outside the front gates .
It 's the aesthetic problem of Pennsylvania Avenue itself , where the two blocks in front of the White House are closed off and barricaded by ungainly concrete planters .
It 's been three years ago this month that President Clinton ordered the closing after a series of breaches of security at the White House and terrorist incidents around the country .
Planners in Washington and beyond talked about turning the stretch of asphalt into the `` people 's boulevard , '' lined with gardens where tourists could linger .
Instead , it 's become the barren province of a few fast-moving pedestrians in business & UR ; & LR ; suits and teenage rollerbladers in pants that are three sizes too large .
For years , good people with good intentions have bandied about ideas for Pennyslvania Avenue and its neighbor , Lafayette Park .
And yet the area looks more scruffy every year , like a neglected corner of an old warehouse district , not the heart of a city that calls itself the capital of the world .
The Kennedy administration preserved the small brick buildings in front of the White House and came up with a plan to install fountains .
That never happened .
After the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan , according to the Washington Post , an architect proposed building a plaza in front of the White House and sending cars , trucks , and buses through a tunnel , blessedly out of sight .
The mere mention of the plan managed to tie up the bureacracy .
Clinton abruptly closed Pennsylvania Avenue in May 1995 .
No one can blame him .
The year before , a plane crashed on the South Lawn and a man fired an assault rifle from the sidewalk outside the White House .
And just before Clinton made his decision , the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma was bombed .
A year after the closing , the National Park Service unveiled a plan for a curving pedestrian promenade in front of the White House .
It wasn n't the Champs Elysees , but it wasn n't bad .
In 1997 , a Treasury Department study , two years in the making , came up with the finding that the concrete planters have `` adverse visual impact . ''
They 're ugly , too .
Plain talk , apparently , isn n't part of the plan for Pennsylvania Avenue .
Testifying before a Congressional subcommittee , Secret Service Director Eljay B. Bowron said allowing traffic back `` would be inconsistent with the available data '' ( translation : dangerous ) .
Officials of Washington still want the avenue reopened .
They claim that the closing clogs traffic and deprives the city of $ 98,000 a year in money from parking meter revenues .
And they say that with straight faces , even though it 's hard to find a working meter anywhere in this dysfunctional city ( the meters have been stolen , leaving headless poles everywhere ) .
The avenue 's closing is called `` temporary . ''
But the yellow median lines are fading and the planters that were plopped down show no signs of moving .
On some chilly mornings , there are more Secret Service agents strolling around than tourists ( unless tourists have wires curling out of their ears and into their suits ) .
What will come of the people 's avenue ?
In this city of experts , it 's hard to find someone knowledgeable to talk about it publicly .
An official of the Commission on Fine Arts referred a caller to the General Services Administration , which recommended the Treasury Department , which passed the questions to the parks service .
One federal official who didn n't want to be named blamed a prominent politician from Washington , who has blocked any efforts to temporarily beautify Pennsylvania Avenue .
The theory is that a beautified street will be that much harder to re-open ( and re-uglify , if that 's the word ) .
Trying to look for something good to say about the oil-stained stretch of pavement , the official boasted , `` It 's become the country 's best arena for rollerblade hockey . ''
But wait .
Maybe these desolate blocks of Pennyslvania Avenue aren n't so inappropriate .
Maybe they should stay just the way they are .
Anyone who has spent time in the fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Phoenix , Albuquerque , Orlando and Atlanta , knows the enduring image of a six-lane highway devoid of human beings .
This is a country where people can not manage without their cars , where healthy young folks engage in this pasttime : driving to the closest parking spaces , taking elevators to the gym and then using machines that simulate stairs .
Why walk outside when you can pay good money to do it indoors ?
Thanks , Mr. President .
Right in your own front yard without spending a lot of money , you 've created the perfect monument to America at the end of the 20th century .
