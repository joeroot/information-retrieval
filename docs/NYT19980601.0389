NATIONAL FORECAST
An unusually strong jet stream stretching from Montana to the Northeast will propel several powerful disturbances across the northern half of the nation .
The contrast in temperatures across the Plains will be remarkable for early June with as much as a 50 degree change between southeast Colorado and western South Dakota .
An intensifying low-pressure system moving east of Lake Huron will draw increasingly humid air northward into the Middle Atlantic states and New England .
The result will be increasing clouds with thunderstorms erupting along an approaching cold front in the Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes .
Several strong to perhaps locally severe storms are possible once again from Ohio to western New England .
The boundary with torrid weather over the South will be marked by a few thunderstorms in the Carolinas and western Tennessee Valley .
Record heat is expected in the western Gulf States and interior Southeast where readings will soar to near 100 degrees .
Very cool weather will spread across the northern Plains along with variable clouds .
Light rain will begin to fall in the western Dakotas as chilly winds from the east ascend the sloping terrain .
Clouds and showers will also dampen parts of the northern Rockies .
High pressure building southward from Saskatchewan will direct dry air into the Northwest promoting sunny skies .
A corridor of moisture from the Pacific will keep morning ocean clouds along much of the West Coast and bring streamers of high clouds into California , Nevada and southern Idaho .
Focus : Gulf Coast Drought
Not a drop of rain fell on Corpus Christi , Texas , during May for the first time since 1887 .
In fact , it was exceptionally dry from the mouth of the Rio Grande River to the Mississippi Delta with New Orleans only measuring . 43 inches , less than 10 percent of the usual May rainfall .
In Corpus Christi , a typical May brings 3.33 inches of rain , which is similar to New York City .
However , the proximity of most Northeast cities to the retreating jet stream prevents a rainless month .
Persistent high pressure over the western Gulf of Mexico last month suppressed the common afternoon showers along the coast .
