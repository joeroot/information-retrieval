Blair Urges IMF , World Bank to Take Reform
LONDON , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday urged the International Monetary Fund and world financial institutions to take reform to improve their performance .
In a speech to be delivered later in the day to the New York Stock Exchange , Blair proposed a one-year deadline for the financial reform .
" I believe we should set ourselves a deadline of one year in which this work should be done , so that we can have the reformed institutions in place before the Millennium .
" Firm proposals should be put to the ( G7 ) Heads of Government Summit next year and then to a wider forum next September , " he said .
He also listed five reform priorities -- greater accountability and transparency , better financial supervision and regulation , the response to short-term liquidity crises , the handling of international capital flows , and the openness and accountability of the IMF itself .
Blair said G7 heads of government should be active in pushing ahead this agenda .
" We should not be afraid to think radically and fundamentally .
We need to commit ourselves today to build a new Bretton Woods for the next millennium , " he said .
