SUSPECTED AIDE TO GOTTI TO BE INDICTED TUESDAY

NEW YORK _ In the next phase of the government 's crackdown on the Gambino crime family 's hierarchy , a suspected top aide to the gang 's imprisoned boss , John J. Gotti , will be indicted Tuesday on federal racketeering charges , defense lawyers say .
Investigators said John D ' Amico , who has been delegated by Gotti to help run the Gambino family while he is in prison , would be charged on gambling and loan sharking counts .
The investigators , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said D ' Amico would be added as a co-defendant in a case involving Gotti 's son , John A. Gotti , who was indicted in January on extensive fraud and extortion accusations .
An indictment and possible conviction of D ' Amico , investigators said , would further weaken the Gambino gang , which has been displaced by the Genovese crime family as the nation 's largest and most powerful Mafia faction .
Both groups use the New York City area as their main base of operations .
D ' Amico 's lawyer , James DiPietro , said in an interview Monday that an indictment against his client might be unsealed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in White Plains , where the case against John A. Gotti , known as Junior , and a dozen other co-defendants is pending .
DiPietro said that based on what he described as `` unofficial reports , '' he believed that D ' Amico 's arrest was imminent .
`` The bottom line is that D ' Amico is ready on a moment 's notice to surrender , '' he said .
`` There is no reason to surround his house at 6 in the morning . ''
The lawyer added that he was trying to negotiate the terms of D ' Amico 's surrender .
D ' Amico , 63 , has unlisted telephone numbers at his home in Hillsdale , N.J . , and at an apartment on the Upper East Side in Manhattan and could not be reached Monday for comment .
D ' Amico , according to FBI agents and his lawyer , lists his occupation as a salesman in Manhattan for a bottled water company .
Marvin Smilon , a spokesman for the U.S. attorney 's office in Manhattan , which is handling the case , declined to comment on the reported charges against D ' Amico .
Federal and state investigators have identified D ' Amico as one of three capos or captains in the Gambino family who were appointed in 1992 by the elder Gotti to administer the gang and safeguard the financial interests of his relatives while he is imprisoned .
The other committee members , investigators said , were Gotti 's brother , Peter , 58 , and Nicholas Corozzo , 58 , another high-ranking capo .
But the conviction and imprisonment last year of Corozzo and the indictment this year of Gotti 's son , who is being held without bail , catapulted D ' Amico into a position of prime importance in the Mafia family 's operations , the authorities said .

J. Bruce Mouw , the former head of the FBI 's Gambino squad , said in a recent interview that D ' Amico and Peter Gotti had been running the family although the younger Gotti , 34 , had the title of acting boss bestowed on him by his father .
Other federal agents and state investigators said John J. Gotti , 57 , who is serving a life sentence without parole in the federal prison in Marion , Ill. , would have to rely even more on his brother , Peter , to maintain control of the family .
D ' Amico has been arrested in New York City five times since the age of 18 on gambling charges that usually resulted in fines without jail time .
Before John Gotti took control of the Gambino family in 1986 , D ' Amico was viewed by federal agents as a low-level Gambino soldier .
Soon after becoming the family 's chief , Gotti promoted D ' Amico to head a crew , according to Mouw , and they became frequent companions at nightspots and race tracks .
