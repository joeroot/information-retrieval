Action Taken to Help Enterprises Fight Pollution
BEIJING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese governmental institutions have taken concrete measures to help small and medium-sized firms upgrade technology and reduce pollution , China Daily reported today .
The Environmentally Sound Technology Transfer Centre , established last year , has set up a website on the Internet to offer domestic and overseas research institutes and enterprises a means to communicate through www.cestt.org.cn for eco-friendly technology exchanges , said Shi Han , director of the center .
It will also help these firms find financing to ease capital shortages which have hindered technological upgrading , and the center 's services will focus on the paper , food , leather , electroplating , and textile industries , which pose more serious pollution threats , noted Shi .
The Ministry of Science and Technology has set up a fund with 3 billion yuan ( 361 million U.S. dollars ) for the enterprises to upgrade traditional industries and develop high technology , since most of them have difficulties in the appliance of eco-friendly technology due to capital shortages .
The Agricultural Bank of China , one of the country 's major commercial banks , will give priority assistance to enterprises that operate in line with State environmental protection regulations and particularly those which introduce advanced environmental protection technology and equipment .
Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture show that small and medium-sized enterprises account for 98.6 percent of all industrial firms .

These enterprises contribute to a quarter of China 's gross domestic produce , one third of farmers ' incomes and 47 percent of industrial incremental value , according to the Township Enterprise Department of the Ministry of Agriculture .
