UNASSUMING TEXAN HASN ' T GONE HOLLYWOOD , BUT STILL THE KING OF COUNTRY MUSIC
( EDS : Accompanied by ELUSIVE GEORGE STRAIT ) ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By DAVE FERMAN c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Several years ago , Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for George Strait 's boxed set , `` Strait Out of the Box . ''
She asked for every interview Strait had done and was given a thin folder with a small batch of articles .
Fine , she said .
What year is this ?
No , she was told , that 's it : total .
All the press on the man who then , as now , was one of the most popular singers in country music .
Three years later , `` Strait Out of the Box '' is one of the most popular boxed sets of all time .
Strait is selling out football stadiums nationwide , averaging 50,000 fans per night without doing any press or TV _ The New York Times , David Letterman , Jay Leno and even Oprah all having asked for an interview and all having been firmly , but politely , told no.
And Kay West sits laughing in her Nashville office .
`` That little folder wasn n't even 2 inches thick , '' says West , Strait 's longtime publicist .
`` Garth generates 2 inches of press in 15 seconds .
George Strait just does not leave footprints as far as the media goes .
He doesn n't do anything .
And he doesn n't make exceptions . ''
That is the dichotomy of Strait 's career .
At 46 , the Pearsall , Texas , native remains the living embodiment of the quiet lone cowboy .
His catalog of hits and the 39 million CDs he has sold help him fill the largest venues in America , but he can still slip out of his stardom and go back to life as an authentic South Texas rancher as easily as most folks take off a pair of jeans .
The shirts stay firmly starched .
The little half-smile stays put .
The gaze stays steady .
The hat stays on .
The music stays pure honky-tonk country with more than a hint of western swing .
The deep , water-over-a-stream-bed voice keeps its lived-in luster .
And the fans _ young and old , male and female _ keep showing up as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career : This year 's tour , officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy Truck Country Music Festival , totals just 18 dates , including Saturday 's show at Texas Stadium .
Strait , West says , stipulated that the shows be on Saturdays and Sundays only so he can fly home ( he has a home in San Antonio and a ranch somewhere in South Texas ) on his private plane for several days each week .
And then , after the final show at Houston 's Rice Stadium on Sunday , June 7 , Strait will go back to attending rodeos and spending time with his wife , Norma ( they 've been married more than 25 years ) , and 17-year-old son George Junior , known as Bubba , even as his latest CD , `` One Step at a Time , '' stays fixed in the Top Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth Brooks , Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes .
Country fans and performers alike seem to get younger every year _ but Strait , amazingly , has sold as well in the '90s as in the '80s , when he burst into prominence .
The soundtrack to the 1992 movie `` Pure Country '' sold 5 million copies .
Since that year , Strait has been the 10th - most-popular musical act of any genre .
This appears more phenomenal considering Strait 's low media profile .
After years as a bar musician ( he was discovered in 1981 while based in San Marcos ) and spending the '80s playing hundreds of dates per year as his national popularity grew , Strait long ago found his own balance between personal and professional .
He will not tour till he drops , and several years ago ended his annual New Year 's Eve show at Dallas ' Reunion Arena to spend the night at home with his family .
He will not curry favor with Nashville or hang out with movie stars or record duets with rock stars or do anything else designed to keep his name out there just a little longer or get one more fan to buy one more CD .
He will sell as well as he does playing by his rules , and that will be that .
For example , says West , after the success of `` Pure Country '' ( in which Strait played , gosh , a country singer who loves rodeo ! ) , he was deluged with movie offers : a sequel , other roles , big money .
And he turned them all down , she says , because he simply didn n't want to make another movie .
`` He did ` Pure Country ' because he got a script he liked , he could do it in Texas , and he had some time off , '' she says .
`` It was relatively painless .
But it wasn n't because he wanted to give his career a boost .
`` He 's talked about this casually .
His life 's been consistent and steady , and he really values that .
How much longer is Bubba going to be at home ?
He doesn n't want to be on the road when his son 's growing up , and when he 's ready to stay home , his son is out of the house . ''
Billy Bob 's Texas marketing director Pam Minick has known Strait for more than a decade ; she says the Strait you hear and the Strait you see in his simple videos is the genuine article .
When not onstage , she says , he 's so unwilling to call attention to himself that he sometimes enters rodeo competitions under an assumed name .
`` He 's just a very humble , unassuming gentleman ; that 's why , in one respect , he doesn n't enjoy the hoopla , '' says Minick , who first saw Strait when he was opening ( yes , opening ) for Rusty Weir in 1982 .
`` It 's sincere .
He 's almost embarrassed when people ask for his autograph .
Obviously , he still loves the response _ but he doesn n't like to talk about himself . ''
