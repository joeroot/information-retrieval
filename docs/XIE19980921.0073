BANGKOK , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Six days after the resignation of Thai Public Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana , his deputy Thirawat Siriwansan was also forced to step down Monday over the corruption scandal , television station Channel 9 said .
Rakkiat and Thirawat are the first two members of the current cabinet who resigned .
The two are believed to be involved in a medical supplies purchasing scandal .
Earlier last month , some doctors in the provinces charged that the Health Ministry has pressured hospitals to buy drugs and medical supplies at inflated prices .
Once exposed , the scandal triggered great discontent among public .
Last Tuesday , Rakkiat , deputy leader of Social Action Party , had to resign under great pressure from both the public and other parties of the coalition .
Analysts said the resignation of the two ministers will lead to an inevitable reshuffle of the cabinet .
Channel 9 also reported that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai , leader of the Democrat Party , has begun negotiating with other parties in the coalition about the reshuffle .
Opinion poll showed that the approval rating of the coalition government has fallen by 10 percentage points to 45.6 percent because of the scandal .
