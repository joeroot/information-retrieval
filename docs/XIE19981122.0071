HANGZHOU , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- A year ago , a young man opened a sex aids store in the city of Yiwu in east China 's Zhejiang Province and , a year later , he was able to set up a chain store .
Sex aids have come to be acceptable by more people around here and stores specializing in sex aid products and sex-related publications can be found in big cities and some villages .
However , it was not too long ago when sex was still a taboo in China and just mentioning the word in public was considered indecent .
Wang Aiping , a family planning consultant in the city of Jiaxing , says that sex and sex aids are no longer mysteries and people are getting more information through various channels , and " this is healthy " .
Jiaxing , a medium-sized city in Zhejiang , has 260 sex aids stores in the urban area and nearby counties and villages .
One store , " Human Origins " , which opened in 1996 , has tripled its business every year and now has 900,000 yuan in sales .
