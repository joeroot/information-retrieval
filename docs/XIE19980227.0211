20,000 Head of Cattle Stolen in Zimbabwe Over
HARARE , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Large-scale commercial farmers in Zimbabwe have lost 21,000 head of cattle worth more than three million U.S.Dollars as cattle rustling increased over the last two years .
Between January 1 , 1996 and December 31 last year , about 20,330 head of cattle were stolen while only 3,000 head were recovered , '' The Herald '' quoted Chairman of the Cattle producers ' Association Les Mallett as reporting on Friday .
At least 906 head of cattle had so far been stolen this year .
Of these 106 head of cattle were recovered , said the report .
Although increasing cases of stocktheft have continued to give producers headaches , what had worried them most was poor rate of revovery .
In an interview on Thursday , Les Mallett said while increasing cases of stocktheft impacted negatively on the restocking exercise , the rate of recovery of stolen cattle was disappointing .
He said : '' Recovering cattle is also made difficult by the fact that cattle can be moved overnight for long distances . "
Mallett called on farmers to immediately report the missing cattle to the police .
To reduce cattle rustling , the association , in conjunction with the Zimbabwe Farmers ' Union , will soon launch a police station in which the police will be offered a monthly award with an aim to make police officers working more hard towards recovery of the stolen cattle , according to Mallett .
