THE LITERARY LIFE AT WILLIAM SHAWN 'S NEW YORKER
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By MARGO MILLER c.1998 The Boston Globe HERE BUT NOT HERE A Love Story By Lillian Ross Random House , 244 pp . , illustrated , $ 25 REMEMBERING MR .
SHAWN 'S NEW YORKER The Invisible Art of Editing By Ved Mehta Overlook Press , 414 pp . , illustrated , $ 29.95
Lillian Ross calls her memoir a love story .
It is also that rare thing , a happy book .
For almost 50 years , she has had the job she wanted : reporting for the New Yorker .
For 40 years , she lived in Manhattan with the man she loved , and who loved her : William Shawn , the magazine 's legendary editor .
Shawn called her his wife , since neither liked the word `` mistress . ''
It was a commuting marriage , Alec Guinness 's `` Captain 's Paradise '' but by cab .
Cecille , Shawn 's legal wife , lived uptown with the couple 's three children , and Ross half a mile away .
This arrangement bothered Ross not a whit : no guilt trip for her , if the wife knew about the arrangement and didn n't want a divorce .
`` All enduring love between two people , '' she begins her memoir , `` feels intrinsically normal to the couple immersed in it . ''
Snatching time together , Ross would taxi uptown with Shawn on the evenings he went home for dinner with Cecille .
He would taxi back to Ross in time for the late evening news on TV .
He sometimes went back uptown .
He had his own private phone in the uptown bedroom .
Ross rang it one morning in 1992 : Shawn was 85 and his heart aging .
`` For the only time in our long life together , his wife answered the telephone , '' Ross reports .
`` He 's gone , '' Cecille told her .
Arriving uptown , Ross was admitted by Shawn 's actor son , Wallace .
He `` looked behind him , '' Ross reports , `` to his mother , for permission . ''
On impulse , Ross reports , she embraced Cecille .
`` He died in my arms , '' said Cecille .
This scene does not appear in Ved Mehta 's memoir about Shawn 's New Yorker , though there 's plenty about Cecille and the children ; nor does Ross figure , except once .
With no more introduction than that she 's a New Yorker writer , she appeals to Mehta , a blind Hindu , for help in adopting a Burmese or Ajunta baby .
`` I saw a picture of a small , Buddha-like man with a soft , gentle face and delicate features , a little like Mr. Shawn , '' Ross tells Mehta .
`` That 's exactly the kind of baby I want .
I thought because you 're from that part of the world you could help me . ''
In any event , Ross adopted baby Erik from Norway because she loved the Paul Muni movie about the Norwegian Resistance during World War II .
Mehta reports about Ross what she can n't report about herself : her voice on the phone .
`` A female voice , light and innocent , yet also hard-edged and tough . ''
Much of Shawn and Ross 's `` marriage '' was by phone .
Ross would be in Hollywood , or in Russia , or hanging out with Hemingway .
To Shawn calling from New York , she would relate the day 's happenings , and this gabfest was a kind of phone sex and editorial conference .
After months watching director John Huston film `` The Red Badge of Courage , '' she told Shawn she could only tell what she saw as a novel .
Tell it that way then , said Shawn .
The articles that became `` Picture '' represented the New Yorker 's first nonfiction novel , not Truman Capote 's `` In Cold Blood . ''
Wondering how to tell his bloody story , Capote hounded Ross , wanting to talk about `` reportage . ''
Ross told him she did `` reporting . ''
And reporting is what she does in `` Here But Not Here . ''
The New Yorker profiles of Shawn 's era have often been criticized for taking the subject at the subject 's own worth .
& UR ; & LR ; Ross herself was criticized for not injecting her opinions into her stories .
Somehow this all comes together to make an endearing but chilling portrait .
She can n't stop reporting on her last great subject .
Still , there are times when she does her beloved Bill no favors .
Ross and Shawn found they had their fathers in common : socialists and secular Jews from Middle Europe who hated & UR ; & LR ; hoity-toity intellectuals .
One of Shawn 's brother 's changed the family name of Chon because it was `` misleadingly Chinese . ''
As `` Jackknife Ben , '' Shawn 's father parlayed his cutlery shop in the Chicago stockyards into a jewelry store .
When the young married Shawns moved to Manhattan , it was Cecille who earned a few dollars by feeding tidbits to the New Yorker for others to polish for the Talk of the Town section .
As the world knows , Shawn succeeded Harold Ross , the founding editor , in 1952 .
In 1945 , Shawn had hired Lillian Ross .
She thinks it was because she made him laugh .
Magazine junkies should read Mehta for insights into the New Yorker 's many-layered editorial process .
Shawn 's own hand in this was `` talmudic , '' Mehta says ; not a word or comma was too trivial to be queried .
All he wanted , said Shawn , was to make the words say what the writer wanted .
So he was a chameleon , one day swinging with a Salinger short story , the next day mired in Hannah Arendt 's German syntax .
No wonder Shawn claimed not to know who he was .
`` Here but not here '' was one of the many ways he described an iffy identity .
Alec Guinness , another unknowable man , could field two families with panache but the New Yorker scribes , Shawn 's third family , bled him dry .
Shawn , anonymous in his blue suits , had his innings as Walter Mitty .
He loved French food , preferably at La Caravelle ; lunching Mehta at the Algonquin , he ate only toasted pound cake .
When Shawn said he 'd like to taste a bit of the glamour in the New Yorker 's ads , Ross bought him yellow silk pajamas at Sulka 's .
Then they drove in his sporty green TR-3 to the Catskills for a weekend out of a Fred Astaire movie .
There was scarcely an actor they didn n't admire .
A self-taught pianist , C major his only key , Shawn found enchantment in jazz and show tunes .
When Duke Ellington died , Shawn and Ross took Erik to see the great man laid out in white tie and tails .
All that evening at home , Ross says they played Ellington recordings `` very loud . ''
Shawn 's last years at the New Yorker were unhappy , culminating in his firing by the new owner in 1987 .
The next editor , Arthur Gottlieb , was lifted in the fifth for British speedballer Tina Brown .
It 's not the same magazine .
Shawn led most issues with two or three short stories .
Brown runs one shortie , in the back , and her periodic `` fiction issues '' are larded with celebrity chat and photos in the fashion-shoot style .
Shawn 's magazine was more worldly , the topics larger , the reporting more global : nuclear weapons , ecology , war , religion .
Brown 's magazine tracks demographics , is fixated on celebrity and money .
Ross , to the horror of the old crowd , has gone to work for Brown .
