China To Reduce Losses in Relics Protection
KUNMING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- China is organizing scientific and effective management to protect its hundreds of thousands of historical sites in order to reduce losses caused by poor management .
There are a total of 300,000 sites of ancient structures , including ancient buildings , temples , cultural ruins and burial grounds in China , called " fixed cultural relics " by the central government which trys to keep track of them all .
To date , 750 historical sites on the state protection list are well-protected ones and are managed with comprehensive records .
However , most of those on regional-level protected lists merely have the name and location , without adequate background material and explanations , due to the lack of sufficient funds and staff .
Some ancient buildings are even facing threats from city and county construction projects .
Zhang Wenbin , head of the State Cultural Relics Bureau , said the bureau will standardize the management of historical sites , establish data banks , and send specialists to cities and counties to guide protection work .
The bureau also plans to organize training courses emphasizing exploration and excavation , and surveying and drawing .
It will also develop software so that computer users can electronically visit historical sites nationwide .
Moreover , a set of atlases is expected to be completely finished within the next decade which will detail all of China 's historical sites .
