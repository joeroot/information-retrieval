Australian Dollar Weakens by Asian Woes
CANBERRA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The Australian dollar closed weaker Monday , as concerns over Asia continued to have an impact .
The local unit ended at 58.67 U.S. cents , down from 59.12 last week .
Portfolio manager at Perpetual Funds Management Glen Thomas said sentiment on the local currency was not particularly positive given the current crisis in Japan .
Despite coming up with a basic agreement to resolve the banking crisis , problems for the Japanese government continued .
Market speculation was strong that the agreement would collapse following remarks from Japanese politicians on both sides of government about the effectiveness of it .
" That 's weighing on the yen and in turn the Aussie , " he said .
The federal election was slowly capturing the attention of the market , Thomas noted .
The proximity of the Labor Party to the ruling coalition in recent polls had made the contest more interesting .
Considerable volatility in the Australian dollar was expected to persist through to year end , Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said in a quarterly economic report .
" Despite the possibility for different influences to exert dominance , the Australian dollar is still likely to face upside resistance , " he said .
James said it was likely there would be an easing in U.S. monetary policy which would further weaken support for the U.S. currency .
He said upside for the Australian dollar would depend on the restoration of confidence in global financial markets .
The local currency was trading at 78.10 Japanese yen from 78.08 and 0.9880 German marks from 1.0002 .
