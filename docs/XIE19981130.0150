Int ' l Labor Body Seeks Coop with Zambian Gemstone
LUSAKA , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The International Labor Organization ( ILO ) is seeking to set up joint ventures with Zambia of gemstone industry , Times of Zambia reported Monday .
The ILO is seeking Zambian partners to go into the joint ventures and establish a center to cut and polish gemstones locally , said the newspaper .
The paper quoted ILO program officer Adel Gromov as saying that the ILO has secured a building and trainers to assist emerging entrepreneurs to become self-reliant but needs the support of local business houses .
Gromov said setting up the center equipped with stone polishing and cutting machines for use by various small scale entrepreneurs will generate foreign exchange through the export of high grade gemstones .
The center is expected to employ 40,000 people including trainers , according to the paper .
" We are looking for Zambian partners to support the center which will be run by Zambians where we shall provide various skills in gemstone processing , " said the ILO official .
Chairman for Emeralds and Semi-Precious Stones Mining Association of Zambia , Ndiwa Yuyi , is supportive of the ILO 's initiative and expressed hope that Zambian businessmen will support the cause to increase the country 's foreign exchange earnings .
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said recently that his country 's gemstones are exported in raw form , thus fetching low prices .
In 1997 for instance , a total of 1,050,000 grams of emerald was sold at a paltry nine million U.S. Dollars .
He said something must be done to improve the gemstone processing capacity in order to raise national income .
