Iraq Struck by Missiles Again , 4 Soldiers Killed
BAGHDAD , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Four Iraqi soldiers were killed and seven others injured in U.S. missile attacks on Monday , said an Iraqi military spokesman .
The spokesman said U.S. war planes flying from Turkey violated Iraqi air space in the so-called no-fly zone in the north of Iraq and launched missiles at Iraqi air defense positions .
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that at 10 : 25 a.m. local time , enemy planes violated Iraqi airspace in the north and flew close to Iraqi air defense positions .
He said that at 1 : 37 p.m. , enemy planes violated Iraqi air space again and flew to the same area and launched missiles at Iraqi air defense positions .
Iraqi soldiers fought back courageously , said the spokesman .
After the 1991 Gulf War touched off by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , the U.S. and Britain set up no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq with a claimed aim of protecting Kurdish minorities in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Iraqi government 's attacks .
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan said on Sunday that Iraq would not recognize the no-fly zones and would fire on enemy planes violating Iraqi airspace .
He said the no-fly zones were set up by the U.S. and Britain unilaterally and without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council .
