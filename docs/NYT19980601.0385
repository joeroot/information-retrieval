DMITRY RACHMANOV : GIFTED PIANIST , ADMIRABLE INITIATIVE
( mk ) By JAMES R. OESTREICH c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ By one count , Dmitry Rachmanov , a Russian-born pianist now widely active in the New York area , played three encores on Thursday evening in his recital at Merkin Concert Hall .
Almost inevitable under the circumstances were Liadov 's `` Musical Snuffbox '' and Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` Flight of the Bumblebee , '' but a Scriabin nocturne for the left hand made for a distinctive close .
By another reckoning , Rachmanov played hardly anything but encores .
His program , `` The Art of the 19th - Century Russian Character Piece , '' offered ditties and little more by 10 composers ranging in fame from Felix Blumenfeld ( a `` moment lyrique '' ) to Tchaikovsky ( `` Reverie du Soir '' and `` Dumka '' ) .
A few years ago the term `` thematic programming '' seemed to become a value judgment : Any theme was good ; any program without one was fatally flawed .
The resulting experience has amply shown otherwise .
Character , or characteristic , pieces are pianistic attempts to capture moods , often fleeting , using a dance , a march , a pastoral or nostalgic turn , or the like .
They are best taken in small , concentrated doses .
An evening of them , especially in a single national style , palls quickly with repetitive gesture , now gentle , wistful or nostalgic , now dark , bold or brave .
Rachmanov 's initiative in turning up unusual items is admirable .
The audience , largely Russian , seemed appreciative , and with good reason , for Rachmanov is in addition a suave and gifted pianist .
He brought considerable color and focus to the individual works .
And occasionally the music had something substantial to say , particularly in the concluding run of works by Rachmaninoff , Medtner and Scriabin .
Rachmaninoff 's Preludes in G ( Op .
32 , No. 5 ) and G minor ( Op .
23 , No. 5 ) seemed models of structural probity in relation to anything that had come before , and Rachmanov made Scriabin 's B minor Fantasy seem the Lisztian epic he hinted at in his program notes .
Indeed , his playing was almost everywhere admirable .
Gentle moments , sometimes finicky , were more often fetching .
And he mustered big technique when necessary .
If he didn n't quite master the finger-boggling bravura of Sergei Liapunov 's `` Lesginka , '' a `` transcendental etude '' after Liszt , he is surely in good company there .
And if his program left a listener starved for sustained musical argument , perhaps Rachmanov will supply that next time around .
