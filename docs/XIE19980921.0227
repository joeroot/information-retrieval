LOS ANGELES , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- A new company based in Kentucky has built an online directory of American businesses already containing 11 million profile pages .

There are about 23 million small businesses in the country , accounting for 51 percent of the private sector 's output and employ 47 percent of the workforce .
CommerceInc has licensed the database of Dun & AMP ; Bradsteet ( D&AMP ; B ) , a leading provider of business-to-business credit , marketing , and purchasing services worldwide .
D&AMP ; B 's database contains information about 50 million U.S. and foreign companies , including 11 million credit-risk and marketing files .
In commerceInc 's database , the information on each company includes basics like company addresses and officers , products , services and territories with links to corporate sites .
It also includes catalogs , access to D&AMP ; B information and links to trade associations , news clippings and wire services .
The directory service company plans to sell site-hosting and building services for 200 U.S. dollars a year to the businesses that list in its database .
Market researchers say there is opportunity in the online market for business-to-business directories .
Compared with Yellow Pages , online directories , which can be put on Intranet , save a lot of time and legwork .
