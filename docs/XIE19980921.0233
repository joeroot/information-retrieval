Most Americans Say Videotape Release Motivated by
WASHINGTON , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Most Americans think the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives is motivated by a desire to embarrass the president rather than a search for the facts in its decision to release the videotape of President Bill Clinton 's grand jury testimony , according to a new poll .
In the CBS News poll , released Sunday , 59 percent said the committee voted to disseminate the tape Monday to embarrass and damage Clinton .
Another 35 percent said the tapes were being made public so others can judge whether Clinton committed perjury in statements about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky .
Democrats on the committee have protested the Republican majority 's decision to make the tape public , saying the release was intended mainly to further humiliate Clinton .
The poll also found that 57 percent didn n't feel the Judiciary Committee needed to begin impeachment hearings against the president , while 37 percent supported hearings .
But there was little doubt among the public that those hearings would take place .
Four out of five predicted there would be hearings , while only 14 percent said there would not .
Only a third of respondents thought Republicans and Democrats would work together in a fair and non-partisan way .
Another third said Republicans should be blamed for what they predicted would be partisan proceedings , while 10 percent said they blamed Democrats and 13 percent both .
Thirty-seven percent thought it would be better for the country if Clinton resigned , up from 32 percent in a CBS poll a week earlier , while 61 percent -- down from 64 percent -- thought it would be better if he finished his term .
The poll of 533 adults , taken Saturday , had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .
