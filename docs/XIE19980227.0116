Cableway Accident Caused by Pilot Error
ROME , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. Marines panel investigating the Italian cableway disaster that killed 20 people last month has determined that the accident was caused by pilot error , the U.S. NBC network reported Friday .
Using data from AWACS radar planes , investigators have determined the warplane was flying at about 120 meters-500 meters below the minimum -- when it cut a cable line in the Dolomites near Mount Cermis , sending 20 people plunging to their deaths on the mountainside below .
The pilot and three crew members , who were flying out of the U.S. Air Force base at Aviano , have refused to explain to investigators why they were flying at such a low altitude , NBC said .
However , Marines spokesperson Scott Campbell did not comment on the report , saying the investigation is nearly complete .
" The team of investigators is still examining certain aspects of the probe , and their conclusions will be drawn at the end , " Campbell said .
