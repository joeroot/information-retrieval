& UR ; Renting a Scooter in Rome & LR ;
Q. Having visited Rome years ago , I remember the traffic , the outrageous maneuvers of the many drivers and the difficulty in getting a cab .
Is it possible to rent a motor scooter ?
_ Linda Imhauser , New York , N.Y .
A. Given your reservations about the drivers , you may want to observe the traffic for a bit to refresh your memory and see if a motor scooter makes sense for you .
Roman drivers can be quite reckless , and a certain propensity to disregard the rules of the road is not uncommon .
Helmets are included in the cost of rental , and a scooter with an engine larger than 125 cc .
requires a driver 's license .
& QL ;
Renting a scooter at Scoot-A-Long , at 302 Via Cavour , telephone ( 39 - 6 ) 6780206 , costs $ 144 to $ 201 a week ( at 1,738 lire to the dollar ) , depending on the model .
The charge includes value added tax as well as insurance for theft up to the full cost of the scooter and minimal accident coverage .
A passport or a driver 's license is required as is a credit card against which the company charges a refundable deposit of $ 173 .
Hours : 9 a.m. to 7 : 30 p.m. daily .
& QL ;
Scooters for Rent , at 84 Via della Purificazione , ( 39 - 6 ) 4885485 , has more models to choose from and is a little more expensive .
Weekly rates range from $ 230 for the least powerful models to $ 525 for 600-cc .
motorcycles .
The price includes VAT and insurance , which covers 75 percent of the value of the scooter and provides minimal accident coverage .
Here , too , a passport or other document is necessary as is a credit card against which a deposit _ ranging from $ 173 to $ 2 , 012 , depending on the model _ is charged .
Hours : 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily .
& UR ; Limit on Use of Phone Cards & LR ;
Q. Why can n't I use a phone card at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan ?
For some reason , the Port Authority has disabled its phones so that phone cards and such devices as voice-mail can n't be used .
_ Joel Margolis , Albany , N.Y .
A. Actually , phone cards of the major companies _ AT&AMP ; T , MCI and Sprint , among others _ can be used to make a call .
But if you dial a company 's 800 number , you will not be able to gain access to such voice-mail functions as retrieving messages , according to Ken Philmus , former manager of the midtown terminal and now deputy general manager at Kennedy International Airport .
As the tiny type on notices affixed to almost all of the phones at the bus depot says : `` This phone does not permit access to : paging or V-mail systems ; incoming calls ; international calls . ''
As is the case at the city 's other major depots , incoming international calls are not accepted .
The reason for these policies is the widespread fraudulent use of phone cards in the early 1990s .
Stolen card numbers were obtained by shoulder surfing _ eavesdropping or watching someone make a legitimate call and then using that caller 's card number .
In addition , hackers were breaking into corporate voice-mail systems .
With almost 200 pay phones , the bus depot has one of the largest number of such phones in the city .
`` In 1990 and 1991 , the terminal was a different place , '' Philmus said .
`` We had 6,500 crimes a year .
Now we 're down to 2,500 crimes . ''
Phone-card fraud and the crime it attracted had also plagued other city depots , which took action , too .
At Penn Station , notices on pay phones urge caution when using phone credit cards .
In addition , panels on either side of the keypad deter unwelcome onlookers .
A test of several phones at the station found that voice-mail messages could be retrieved but that punching in too many voice-mail commands _ what the breaking point is is not clear _ produced the message `` No additional dialing allowed '' and caused the keypad to go dead .
& QL ;
At Grand Central Terminal , no international outgoing calls can be made and access to voice-mail may also be limited , Dan Brucker , a spokesman for Metro-North , said .
& QL ;
Now that phone fraud has abated , the Port Authority has decided on a six-month experiment at the bus terminal : Since January about a dozen phones without distinguishing markings have allowed access to voice-mail and to outgoing international calls .
The test 's results will determine future steps , Philmus said .
& UR ; Layover in Brussels & LR ;
Q. I will have a layover at the Brussels airport from 7 : 45 a.m. until 2 : 55 p.m. Can you recommend how to use this time to see some of Brussels ?
Susan P. Levine , M.D . , River Forest , Ill.
A. The airport , Zaventem , could hardly be handier to the city : The train from Zaventem runs every 20 minutes during the day , and it 's just a 18-minute ride to the Gare Centrale .
The fare is $ 2.35 second class and $ 3.60 first class ( at 37 Belgian francs to the dollar ) .
& QL ;
From the station it 's a five-minute walk to the Grand ' Place , which is bounded by a constellation of guild houses _ dating from the 18th century and later _ for bakers , brewers , boatmen and coopers , among others .
Since the museums and the City Hall don n't open till 10 a.m. , you could stop at a cafe on the Grand ' Place or observe the flower market there ; it runs till 11 or 11 : 30 .
Or you could explore the Galeries St . - Hubert , a glassed-in luxury shopping arcade where you 'll find places to eat and stores selling goods including Neuhaus chocolates and Delvaux handbags .
The Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts comprises the Musee d ' Art Ancien , at 3 Rue de la Regence , and the Musee d ' Art Moderne , 1 Place Royale .
On their walls you will find the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder , Rubens , Van Dyck and Memling as well as those of such 19th - and 20th - century artists as James Ensor and Paul Delvaux of Belgium and of Seurat , Bonnard , Signac and Vuillard .
( The Magrittes are in a special exhibition ending June 28 that is sold out . ) Single entry fee to both museums : $ 4.10 .
Closed Monday .
& QL ;
The Centre Belge de la Band Dessinnee ( the Belgian Comic Strip Museum ) , at 20 Rue des Sables , will be of interest of fans of Tintin .
Original plates by his creator , Herge , are on view there .
The museum will also attract admirers of its designer , the Art Nouveau architect Victor Horta known for his interiors and furniture .
Admission : $ 5.50 .
Closed Monday .
& QL ;
Another worthwhile stop is the 15th - century Hotel de Ville , or City Hall , which dominates the Grand ' Place .
The treasures include 18th - century tapestries and artworks depicting noted personalities .
A self-guided tour costs $ 2.20 .
This list is hardly comprehensive , of course , but time is short .
