Germany Meets Euro Budget Deficit Target
BONN , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Germany announced Friday that it has met the budget deficit limit set for joining the planned single European currency , the Euro .
According to data published by the German federal statistics office , the 1997 German budget deficit amounted to 96.5 billion marks ( 53 billion U.S. dollars ) , or 2.7 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , well below the 3 percent of GDP limit set by the Maastricht Treaty for Euro membership .
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that with Germany meeting the most important requirement for participation in the Euro , a firmer foundation had been laid for a stable common currency .
However , the statistics also showed that Germany had narrowly missed a second Euro target for accumulated national debt .
With an overall national debt of 2.23 trillion marks ( 1.23 trillion dollars ) in 1997 , or 61.3 percent of GDP , Germany overshot the Maastricht limit of 60 percent of GDP .
But analysts say that this is unlikely to prevent Germany from joining the Euro from the start in 1999 .
Bonn has argued that the huge costs of its 1990 reunification have artificially driven up its debt levels .
The final decision on which countries will be able to join the Euro will be made by leaders of the 15 EU member states early May on the basis of official convergence reports to be published by the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute .
