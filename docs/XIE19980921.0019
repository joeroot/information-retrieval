Netanyahu Says Considerable Progress Made in
JERUSALEM , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that " considerable progress " had been made on the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank during U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross ' visit to the region , which ended Saturday night .
" There was considerable progress on one issue ... that was the issue of the nature reserve .
I hope it will be completed soon , " Netanyahu told Israel Radio in an interview .
He did not elaborate .
Sources said that Israel and the Palestinians have moved closer on an Israeli proposal that it pullback its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank , as an American initiative demands , but turn 3 percent of that land into a nature reserve , where Israel will retain full security responsibility and the Palestinians are not allowed to settle .
It has been reported that the Palestinians accepted the principle of the nature reserve after Israel agreed to classify the areas as an " Area B , " guaranteeing that part of the Judean Desert will eventually return to the Palestinians .
Netanyahu said the main obstacle to an agreement was not on the Israeli side , but was " persistent refusal " of the Palestinians to fulfill their commitments to fight terrorism .
He urged the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) to take steps to crack down on the infrastructure of terrorist organizations , reduce the size of its police force , confiscate illegal weapons and reconvene the Palestinian National Council to revise the Palestinian Covenant , parts of which call for destruction of Israel .
The Palestinians say that they have fulfilled their commitments to fight terrorism , accusing Israel of using the security issue as an excuse to delay its withdrawal from the West Bank .
Netanyahu 's remarks came one day after Ross ended his 11 days of shuttle diplomacy , during which he held several rounds of talks with Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat , as well as other key figures in the Israeli-Palestinian talks .
In his last effort before departing for Washington late Saturday night , Ross held separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu and was relieved to hear that the two agreed in principle to hold direct talks .
Both Arafat and Netanyahu will be in New York later this week to attend the U.N. General Assembly .
Washington has expected such a summit to take place and the two leaders could seal a deal over the long overdue Israeli withdrawal .
Netanyahu reiterated in the interview that he would not oppose to meeting Arafat , but said that " a meeting is one thing , the substance of the meeting is another thing . "
Commenting on the sexual scandal surrounding U.S. President Bill Clinton , which analysts say has cast a shadow over Ross ' visit , Netanyahu said he hoped the Americans could put the scandal behind them as soon as possible .
A prolonged crisis in Washington will cause great instability in the Middle East , he said .
