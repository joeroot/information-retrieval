NEW YORK _ Mary Elizabeth Grenander , a longtime professor of English who was an authority on the American writer Ambrose Bierce , known for his satirical wit and his horror stories , died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in East Berne , N.Y .
She was 79 .
Professor Grenander , known as M.E .
Grenander , taught at the State University of New York at Albany from 1948 until she retired in 1989 as a Distinguished Service Professor of English .
She was a former president of the New York American Studies Association .
Her many writings about Bierce , who was born in 1842 and went to Mexico in 1913 and vanished , appeared over more than two decades .
Analyzing ironic horror stories he wrote , she once said : `` The actual situation is harmful , with the protagonist conceiving it to be harmless and reacting accordingly . ''
She edited and wrote the introduction for the book `` Poems of Ambrose Bierce '' ( 1995 , Nebraska ) , which the literary journal American Notes and Queries , or ANQ , called `` a provocative volume '' that `` should spark further interest in Bierce . ''
Professor Grenander received a Fulbright Fellowship and grants from institutions including the National Endowment for the Humanities , the New York Council for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation .
She gave more than $ 1 million to SUNY Albany , including $ 500,000 to establish a professorship in memory of her husband , James Corbett , a professor of physics at the same university , who died in 1994 .
Lisa James of the university 's Office of University Relations said that Professor Grenander and her husband prospered `` through long-term investments in the stock market . ''
She was born in Rewey , Wis. , and received bachelor 's and master 's degrees and a doctorate , all in English , from the University of Chicago , in the 1940s .
Her marriage to Jean Louis Auclair ended in divorce .
She married Professor Corbett in 1972 .
She is survived by two sisters , Charlotte White , of Puyallup , Wash. , and Karen Hanley , of Miami , Fla.
