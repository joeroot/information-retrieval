Some U.N. Relief Workers Return to Baghdad
BAGHDAD , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Some U.N. relief workers evacuated to Jordan in the U.S . - British bombardment against Iraq last week returned to Baghdad Wednesday evening .
But the number of the returned relief workers is not immediately known .
U.N. sources here told Xinhua that more U.N. humanitarian staff will come back in the coming few days .
There were around 200 U.N. relief workers in Baghdad before the U.S. and Britain air raids , which lasted four days with a declared aim to retaliate Iraq 's defiance of U.N. weapons inspections .
The weapons inspections , which began in 1991 after the Gulf War sparked by Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 , have repeatedly run into problems due to the disputes between Baghdad and the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq .
About 240 U.N. humanitarian staff are now working in northern Iraq 's three Kurdish autonomous governorates .
They stayed there during the bombing and continued their mission .
U.N. Officials here warned that damage caused by the air strikes will make the U.N. humanitarian work in Iraq even tougher .
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 's Special Envoy to Iraq Prakash Shah said earlier that there might be a need for emergency aid as a result of the U.S. bombing .
