DIANA IS STILL AT CENTER OF ROYAL PROBLEMS
News Analysis ( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By BERNARD D. KAPLAN c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
PARIS _ Nine months after her death in a car crash , Princess Diana remains a figure of controversy as the British royal family and her brother , Earl Spencer , feud over her spiritual legacy .
At the center of the squabble are her two adolescent sons , Princes William and Henry , over whom her brother claimed special protective rights in an emotional and angry oration at Diana 's funeral last September in Westminster Abbey .
`` ( William and Henry ) have unwittingly been drawn into a destructive battle between the Windsors and the Spencers , '' according to James Whitaker , a veteran reporter on the royals , writing in Britain 's Spectator magazine .
`` War has not been officially declared , '' Whitaker said , but it is `` the footing on which the two families now find themselves . ''
Although Queen Elizabeth II and Diana 's former husband , Prince Charles , have skillfully retrieved some of the popularity they lost when the princess died , their bitter feelings toward the Spencers are as strong as ever , Whitaker noted .
They blame Earl Spencer for deliberately exacerbating the wave of national hostility toward the royal family at the time of the funeral , which briefly threatened to destabilize the 1,000-year-old monarchy .
As seen from Buckingham Palace , Spencer 's latest offense has been to try to woo the two young princes away from their father _ just as he implicitly pledged to do when he declared at the funeral : `` We , your blood family will do all we can to continue in the imaginative and loving way in which you ( Diana ) were steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition , but can sing openly as you had planned . ''
When the boys were invited to spend their summer vacation with Diana 's elder sister , Sarah McCorquodale , and her family , Charles and the queen regarded the proposal as an attempt to separate William and Harry from their father close to the anniversary of their mother 's death , according to Whitaker .
But `` William and Harry themselves ...
decided to reject the offer , '' said the royals-watcher .
`` In all matters concerning them , they meet as a family , talk and then make their decision . ''
The boys `` have made clear they would rather be with their paternal family , '' he added .
Whitaker quoted a `` Buckingham Palace elder '' as saying that Spencer 's behavior at the funeral `` will never be forgotten or forgiven .
Why should anyone think he could give the two princes a fraction of what their father can ?
The answer is he can n't , and if Spencer has to learn this the hard way , so be it . ''
The earl may also have committed a serious blunder by recently calling for the Diana Memorial Fund to be wound up , charging that it has sponsored several unworthy enterprises , thus doing harm to her memory .
Paradoxically , the president of the fund is Spencer 's sister , Sarah .
According to Rachel Tisdale , the author of several books on the royal family , `` ( Spencer 's ) criticism of the fund has received a cold reception from the public and enabled the royals discreetly to throw their support behind the fund 's continuation .
This is helping to do away with the perception that Charles and the queen wish to phase out Diana 's memory .
On the contrary , now that she is gone , they regard her as a royal asset . ''
