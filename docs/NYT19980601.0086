MONTGOMERY , Ala. _ This was battle of pocket dynasties , big doings on a modest scale .
A meeting of the two biggest goggle-eyes in the goldfish pond , a collision of the two hottest Hyundais on the lot .
To Saturday 's Division II baseball championship , Tampa brought its rendition of David Wells .
Only in college , those applying for perfection have an actual waistline .
Mike Valdes is a junkballer of note , capable of doing more damage by deception than most do by velocity .
Kennesaw State countered by assembling all the college-eligible youth of Cobb County , Ga. capable of putting a metal truncheon to good use .
The roster that features seven starters from Cobb hit a combined . 344 this season , and had scored an average of 11 runs in the three national tournament games leading to Saturday 's final .
This was to be the only possible matchup that could be certified a true championship , No. 1-ranked Kennesaw State against No. 2 Tampa , strength going against strength .
This was to be one of those inevitable stare-downs that are intense , no matter the division .
This time , the Owls blinked .
Valdes ( 15 - 1 ) was perfect for 4 2 / 3 innings , and close enough the rest of the way to assemble the seventh straight complete-game victory by Tampa 's starters .
A home run by Kennesaw designated hitter Pat McPhee was the only meaningful blemish on Tampa 's 6 - 1 victory .
Meanwhile , Kennesaw returned home with a bad case of ringing in the ears , the result of 14 Tampa hits pinging off metallic bats .
Its own ace , Chris Bowen ( 12 - 2 ) , was ineffective for a second tournament start .
Add the fact that the Spartans ran down every rumor of a hit _ '' the best defensive team we 've run up against , by far , '' said Owls left fielder Jason Jones _ and at least Kennesaw State had the comfort of knowing that it was beaten by neither fluke nor fraud .
Those in Owl colors are left to balance the best season any of them are likely to know against the single most crushing loss they have yet experienced on a diamond .
`` We 'll always be disappointed in losing the last game , '' said third baseman Nathan Cothran .
Here was a Kennesaw State bunch that won an amazing 92 percent of its games this season ( 61 - 5 ) , a plundering that no one else has approached in the decade .
The Owls were ranked No. 1 for much of the year only because there was nothing better available .
They 'd trade off the bulk of the 61 for just one at the end .
`` ` Unfulfilling ' is the word you 'd use for what we feel right now , '' said coach Mike Sansing .
Having gorged themselves all year long , they still go away hungry .
The championship game was a completely new experience for Kennesaw State this season .
It had lost to no one by more than four runs until Saturday , and had never walked away from one muttering , as did Sansing Saturday , `` I don n't think we ever threatened . ''
Fair or not , greatness does not allow a night off .
At stake here was the condensed version of that classic title , `` Team of the '90s . ''
Kennesaw State and Tampa now have accounted for five of the last seven Division II championships .
There are 224 programs attempting baseball at this modest level , meaning that these two have left cleat marks upon many shoulders .
Tampa took it all Saturday .
It is the baddest poodle in the pound .
