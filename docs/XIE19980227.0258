BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese archaeologists have unearthed the remains of 19 buildings dating back 7,000 years in east China 's Shandong Province .
The find has just been selected as one of China 's top ten archaeological finds in 1997 .
According to China 's leading archaeologists here , who made the selection , the buildings were part of a tribal settlement .
The buildings , with half of their structures dug underground , can be divided into two groups -- one in the shape of square with one round corner , and the other irregular .
The former usually cover an area of 30 - 40 sq m , with a stone or pottery stove inside ; the latter , smaller than the former , are thought to have been used for the storage of pottery and food .
Experts say that most of the remains are well preserved , and some even have pottery or stone wares placed in their original positions .
