Ethiopia Calls for Law to Protect Natural
ADDIS ABABA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority Wednesday called for a law to protect natural resources from man-made and natural disasters .
Speaking at a national meeting on the draft environmental protection law here , Tewolde-Brirhan Gebre-Egziabher , general manager of the Authority , said that the national environmental protection policy approved a year ago in Ethiopia has not been translated into law due to capacity limitation .
Natural resources should be protected by law , he stressed .
He said that environmental protection is the responsibility of not only executive bodies but also of the general public at large .
Ethiopia 's forest resource has depleted from 40 percent about a century ago to only two percent now .
Some 100,000 to 150,000 hectares of land is deforested annually in the country , said sources from the three-day meeting .
