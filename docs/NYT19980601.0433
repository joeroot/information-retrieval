Q. My mother says sitting too close to the TV will ruin my eyes .
Is she right ?
A. Not according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology .
In fact , the academy 's public information office says , children can focus up close without eye strain better than adults .
That is because the lens , which changes its focus for nearby and faraway viewing , tends to lose some of its flexibility as people grow older .
Usually , sitting very close to the television set is a habit that children grow out of .
However , the academy says , sitting close to the screen to get a clearer image may be a symptom of uncorrected nearsightedness , and children who persist in doing it should be tested for myopia .
A lot of the traditional parental warnings about ruining your sight are only partly valid , according to ophthalmologists .
For example , reading in dim light may tire your eyes , but it will not damage them .
Eye fatigue is a risk when reading in dim light and when using a computer screen for long periods , but it is reversible and preventable with common-sense measures like accurately ground corrective lenses designed for the distance at which they will be used and sufficient blinking to lubricate dry eyes .
The academy especially recommends taking regular breaks to look up or across the room , because looking at objects farther away usually relieves the strain on eyes .
If vision blurs or eyes tire very easily , the academy says , it is time to get an eye examination from an ophthalmologist .
