Greece Welcomes U.N. Resolutions on Cyprus
ATHENS , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Greece on Wednesday hailed the two resolutions on Cyprus adopted unanimously by the U.N. Security Council , saying that the U.N. move showed the international community 's strong interest in the Cyprus problem .
The simultaneous adoption of the two resolutions showed both the strong interest of the international community in the Cyprus problem and the Security Council 's realization of the dangers entailed by any further prolongation of the problem , Greece 's Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said while commenting on the two resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday .
The first resolution allows the renewal of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus for another six months while the second calling on the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to respond positively to efforts by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 's deputy special representative for Cyprus , Ann Hercus , to secure agreement on measures to reduce tension and build confidence between the two communities .
Pangalos said that it was indeed the first time that the Security Council , with new , very strong expressions and specific instructions and directions , appeared determined to make efforts not only for a short-term reduction of tension , but to tackle in substance the crucial problem of security and at the same time moved decisively to resolve the Cyprus problem .
He added that the resolutions clearly described the main parameters for resolving the Cyprus problem and in so doing , stated in the most responsible , official and categorical way that any other proposals raised by the Turkish side were not being considered by the international community and were regarded as unacceptable .
The minister stressed that there was only one state and only one legitimate government in Cyprus and the only solution to the Cyprus problem was a federation .
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens .
For years , the U.N . - sponsored negotiations between the two communities for peacefully resolving the Cyprus problem have made no progress due to the differences of their stances towards settling the division problem .
Currently , the situation in the divided island has remained tense since Cyprus decided last year to purchase and install the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles , with Turkey openly threatening to use force to prevent the missile deployment .
