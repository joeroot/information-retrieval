SPORTS COLUMN : A SEASON OF RENEWAL FOR THE JETS
( bl ) By WILLIAM C. RHODEN c.1999 N.Y .

The New York Jets celebrate the first day of the new year with an unfamiliar personae .
They begin 1999 as champions .
In many ways , the Jets are a perfect team for Jan. 1.
They embody the theme and spirit of a new year : rejuvenation , clean slates and second chances .
The obvious symbol of this regeneration is Vinny Testaverde , the Jets veteran quarterback whose career was in the lost and found before the Jets signed him as a backup quarterback last summer .
The season began with the starting quarterback , Glenn Foley , being elected as team captain ; four months later and in an indication of how the Jets have evolved , Testaverde was voted the most valuable player .
Beyond Testaverde the core of this Jets team is rehabilitated careers : Pepper Johnson , squeezing one more season out of a 13-year career ; Bryan Cox , dismissed as too volatile to be productive , giving form and passion to the Jets defense .
There have been smaller triumphs as well .
Coach Bill Parcells said the player who has come the furthest is Matt O ' Dwyre .
The 26-year-old guard has managed to check his volatile temper , which resulted in costly , ill-timed penalties last season when he led the offensive line in penalties and personal fouls .
`` The last thing that you need is to make the wrong play at the wrong time , ' O ' Dwyre said Thursday .
`` You pick your spots better .
You do it earlier rather than later .
It 's not good for the team .
It 's not good for my career . ''
In another corner of the Jets locker room , Corwin Brown contemplated the dramatic course his career has taken .
Brown was with Parcells in New England in 1996 when the Patriots reached the Super Bowl , then was unexpectedly waived the following summer .
Parcells invited him to camp , and last week Brown was promoted to starting safety .
`` When you go to the Super Bowl one year , then the next year you don n't even make the playoffs , that 's a long season , '' Brown said , referring to his first season with the Jets .
`` But I believed in Bill .
I was thinking about all this last Saturday in the last couple minutes of the Buffalo game .
I didn n't know what I was getting into when I came here .
This happened quicker than I thought it would happen .
The attitude on this team has changed ; it 's like a completely different team . ''
Brown stopped short of saying he is a new player , even a rehabilitated player .
He 's a confident player whose self confidence , shaken after being cut by New England , is restored .
`` I wasn n't down on my ability , '' Brown said .
`` I was just disappointed in the way things turned out .
I didn n't think I deserved to be cut , but things happen .
Bill said not to let it get me down .
I never really did . ''
Brown 's best friend , teammate and chess partner in New England , Jimmy Hitchcock , was unexpectedly traded to Minnesota before the season , and he , too , is flourishing .
`` We talk a lot about things that have happened , '' Brown said .
`` When things happen to you that you don n't feel are right , I really believe that things will turn out good if you just hang in there . ''
The Jets and Vikings in Super Bowl XXXIII ?
`` That would be like a story book ending , '' Brown said .
`` But we 've got a lot of football to play between then and now . ''
Frank Mickens sat on a stool next to Brown .
The last three seasons have been a roller-coaster ride for him as well .
Mickens started at cornerback in 1996 for the 1 - 15 Jets .
Last season he lost his job to Otis Smith who came with Parcells from New England .
`` I was bitter at first , '' he said .
`` I did not welcome the change .
But you have to eat what 's on the table in front of you .
I vowed to be the best nickel back in the NFL , but I never lost my desire to play all the time . ''
Until Aaron Glenn was injured four weeks ago , Mickens was beginning to doubt that he would ever have an opportunity to be a full-time player .
But when Glenn was injured in a game against Seattle , Mickens was suddenly pressed into service .
Mickens shut down Joey Galloway , Seattle 's All-Pro receiver , and has played nearly flawless football since .
`` The opportunity didn n't come when I wanted it to come , but God is always on time , '' Mickens said .
`` I 've started a quarter of the season , played in some of the biggest games in the history of the franchise .
`` This is unwalked on ground for me , '' he added , referring to playing in the playoffs .
`` I 'm excited .
I can n't wait . ''
New year , new season , a fresh lease on life .
