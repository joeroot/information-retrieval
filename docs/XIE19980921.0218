Tyson Expected to Fight in November
WASHINGTON , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Mike Tyson , waiting for a green light given from a psychiatrist , could be fight his first return-bout by the end of November if he gets a license .
" If I ever get reinstated again , I 'll probably make 300 million , " Tyson said on Saturday .
He is broke despite earning more than 100 million in his last six fights .
The former heavyweight champion stands ready to cash in with a series of fights that figure to culminate in the third fight with Evander Holyfield , whose ears were bit by Tyson last year in a title bout .
Though Tyson made more than 100 million in offical purses in six fights , he is now basically broke and owes the IRS 13 million in back taxes .
Tyson 's attorney Dale Kinsella said Tyson only got 5.2 million out of the 30 million purse he received from the second bout with Holyfield .
Kinsella promised that when Tyson resumes fighting , the comission will be given copies of all the contracts he has singned .
" Mike Tyson will be fighting for Mike Tyson again , not all the people around him , " Kinsella said .
Tyson had signed a contract with his former promoter Don King and his two co-managers to give them half of everything he made .
But now Tyson has changed his lawyers and advisers .
His new advisers have already negotiated an extension of his old deal with the Showtime network , which televises his fights via pay-per-view .
" Win or lose , people want to see Mike Tyson , " Showtime executive Jay Larkin said .
" There 's an almost insatiable appetite to see him in the ring . "
Tyson must be licensed and also must either reach a deal with King on his promotional rights or get a court to rule in his favor .
Tyson has sued King and his former managers to break their contracts and recover money he claims was rightfully his .
