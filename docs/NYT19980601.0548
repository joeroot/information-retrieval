WASHINGTON _ President Clinton , avoiding a showdown in the Supreme Court , sidestepped a fight Monday over executive privilege to prevent two White House aides from testifying in independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr 's investigation of the Monica S. Lewinsky matter .
Instead , White House lawyers will prolong their battle with Starr by pursuing Clinton 's claim that his conversations with deputy counsel Bruce R. Lindsey are shielded from Starr 's inquiry by attorney-client privilege .
The White House move , laid out in a Supreme Court motion , was seen as having stymied Starr 's request last week that the justices make a rare , urgent ruling in the dispute over testimony by presidential aides .
By dropping the executive privilege appeal , White House lawyers said there was no reason for the Supreme Court to act before its upcoming summer recess .
`` The fate of the nation will not hang in the balance , '' the White House asserted in its Supreme Court motion .
The latest White House strategy was seen as possibly sparing Clinton the embarrassment of oral arguments before the Supreme Court that might prompt comparisons between him and President Richard M. Nixon 's effort not to disclose Watergate tapes .
Starr , apparently anticipating the White House move , indirectly criticized Clinton 's lawyers in a speech to a county bar association in Charlotte , N.C .
He said defense lawyers `` have a duty not to use their skills to impede the search for truth . ''
Starr is investigating whether Clinton lied under oath about his relationship with Lewinsky or obstructed justice by trying to cover up an alleged affair .
Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied having a relationship under oath .
`` A good lawyer ...
must urge the client against steps that are likely to impede the quest for truth , '' Starr said .
White House counsel Charles F.C .
Ruff offered what he described as a `` polite '' version of his reaction to Starr 's criticism .
`` I 'm surprised that a lawyer of Mr. Starr 's distinction would suggest that because one of his colleagues in the bar disagrees with him on law , principle , and process , it means the colleague is somehow engaged in an act of obstruction , '' Ruff said .
`` I 'm sure he would understand that lawyers of good heart and good will disagree , and simply because he says something is a matter of law does not make it so . ''
Starr has until this evening to respond to the White House motion .
The Supreme Court could announce by Thursday whether it will hear the case and bypass the appeals court .
On a related front , the Justice Department filed notice that it will appeal a federal judge 's ruling last month that requires Secret Service agents to testify about what they might know of Clinton 's relationship with Lewinsky , a former White House intern .
A Justice Department official refused to comment on the matter because the case is under seal .
But with the appeal , department lawyers will pursue their argument that a president 's life could be in jeopardy if he distances himself from agents out of fear they might tell a grand jury what they see and hear on the job .
US District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson recently rejected that argument .
The legal maneuverings Monday stemmed from several recent decisions by Johnson , including her ruling that Lindsey and presidential adviser Sidney Blumenthal must answer questions before the grand jury .
They had refused , citing Clinton 's claim of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege .
The White House , by abandoning the executive privilege claim , effectively yielded to Johnson 's decision that Blumenthal testify .
A former journalist , Blumenthal is more a political adviser to Clinton than a legal counsel .
Yet Starr continued to express frustration about his standoff with Clinton and his legal team .
In his speech , he argued that courts already have concluded that government lawyers paid by taxpayers do not have special privileges in criminal cases involving public officials .
Starr said , `` Litigants often try , as they 're entitled to do , to concoct new privileges by contending that their relationship is just as important as attorney-client relationship or the spousal relationship or the priest-penitent relationship .
But the problem is , they 're arguing in the wrong forum ...
Congress is the proper forum for new federal privileges to be recognized in federal grand jury proceedings . ''
Ruff countered that federal courts in Washington have consistently upheld the president 's right to invoke attorney-client privilege .
He also denied that the latest strategy was aimed at frustrating Starr .
`` There will undoubtedly be folks out there who will suggest there must be some great scheme to delay , '' Ruff said .
`` That 's just nonsense . ''
In court papers , Clinton 's lawyers tried to block Starr 's request for an urgent ruling on attorney-client privilege by arguing the Supreme Court has issued such decisions only in cases of special national interest , such as Watergate , President Dwight D. Eisenhower 's seizure of the nation 's steel mills during the Korean War , and the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s .
`` The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out , '' Ruff said in a news briefing .
`` This is not steel seizure , this is not Iranian hostages , this is not US v. Nixon . ''
The White House , in making its stand on the attorney-client privilege , was seen as choosing to defend a principle more palatable to mainstream Americans than executive privilege , which is available only to the president and his aides .
Last year , the White House asked the Supreme Court to shield first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton from having to hand over notes of her conversations with presidential lawyers to Starr .
The high court , in a one-line order , refused to hear the White House claim of secrecy because of attorney-client privilege .
Still , several analysts said the White House had clearly made a political calculation in retreating from the executive privilege question , which the Supreme Court last weighed in the Watergate case .
`` Apparently their first concern was trying to get out from under executive privilege , '' said John Q. Barrett , a criminal law professor at St. John 's University School of Law and former associate counsel to the Iran-Contra special prosecutor , Lawrence E. Walsh .
Barrett said the prospect of losing a Supreme Court decision over executive privilege , in the summer 's heat , and with its attendant parallels to Watergate , `` was not in the president 's best interest .
It just has too much of a Nixon echo , '' he said .
In July 1974 , the Supreme Court ruled 8 - 0 against Nixon , ordering him to surrender the Watergate tapes and precipitating his resignation in August .
Independent counsel Leon Jaworski had asked the court the previous May for an expedited ruling in his executive privilege battle with Nixon over the tapes .
White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry said concerns about comparisons to Watergate did not affect Monday 's decision regarding executive privilege .
`` The opinion was a good one , '' he said about the White House decision , `` and the law is the law . ''
Ruff added : `` Whatever black cloud of history others may be casting over this exercise , it hasn n't affected us . ''
