U.S. Urged to Press Israel to Honor Agreement
CAIRO , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday called on the United States to press Israel to carry on with the Wye River agreement .
The accord is obligatory to any Israeli government as it was overwhelmingly sanctioned by 75 votes of the 120-seat Israeli Knesset ( Parliament ) , Arafat told reporters after a meeting with Arab League chief Esmat Abdel-Meguid .
Arafat accused Israel 's Likud-led government of evading the obligations enshrined in the agreements signed with the Palestinians .
He also voiced astonishment over Israel 's evasion of obligations under the pretext of early elections , wondering if Israel would suspend dealings with the U.S. , Jordan or any other countries under the pretext .
Under the U.S . - brokered Wye River accord signed between the Palestinians and Israel last October in Washington , Israel should withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank .
After carrying out the first phase of the pullback , Israel said it will halt the implementation of the accord due to Palestinians ' anti-Israeli rhetoric and failure to cancel the plan to declare an independent Palestinian state next May .
Arafat wrapped up his two-day visit to Egypt and returned home in the day .
