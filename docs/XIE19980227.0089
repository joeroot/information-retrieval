23 Draft Decisions Adopted at Fourth Basel Convention
KUALA LUMPUR , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The fourth Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal concluded in Malaysia Friday with 23 draft decisions unanimously agreed upon .
The inclusion of List A ( for hazardous wastes ) and List B ( for non-hazardous wastes ) as new annexes to the Basel Convention was among the 23 draft decisions unanimously agreed upon at the conclusion of the five-day meeting held in Kuching , Sarawak , East Malaysia , reports reaching here said .
The inclusion of hazardous wastes worldwide on List A is expected to be enforced within six months , the reports quoted Fourth Basel Convention President Rosnani Ibarahim as saying .
Placed as List A under Article 1 , Paragraph 1 ( a ) of the Basel Convention are 45 categories of wastes considered as hazardous for transboundary movement because of their ecotoxic nature while those in List B are non-hazardous and therefore not subjected to any of the provisions .
" The meeting also decided to leave Annex 7 unchanged until amendment contained in decision 23 / 1 enters into force , " she was quoted as saying at a news conference there .
Under Annex 7 , countries listed as members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) and the European Union are prohibited by the Basel ban adopted in 1995 from exporting hazardous wastes to non OECD developing countries .
The president said the convention would undertake a study to analyze the implications of Annex 7 for which ratification from at least three fourths of the 117 members would be needed for the ban amendment .
So far 17 members have ratified it while Malaysia is in the process of doing so .
Apart from pushing for enforcement of the ban worldwide , she said the convention also aimed at upgrading the capacity of countries particularly developing nations towards improving their sound management of wastes .
They could not continue to depend on other countries in the handling of their own wastes , she said .
Meanwhile , the Greenpeace Movement and Basel Action Network in a joint news conference in Kuching had singled out the United States , Australia , Canada and New Zealand for their " bad faith negotiations " , according to the reports .
Greenpeace Movement spokesperson Kevin Stairs was quoted as saying these OECD countries were acting in self-interest to keep open the cheap option of sending their hazardous wastes to industrializing countries for disposal and recycling .
The proposal on the ban amendment was opposed by the Arab League countries , Tanzania , India , Latin America and other countries which had already imposed the ban .
Stairs said the most significant threat to the ban amendment at the convention came from Israel and Slovenia .
Switzerland is expected to host the next conference which is being sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program .
