No Progress Made as NBA , Union Make Final Offers
WASHINGTON , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The cancellation of the NBA season appears inevitable after the league and union exchanged final proposals today at a five-hour meeting which ended with the sides still far apart .
" We advised the union that no further offers will be made , " said NBA commissioner David Stern , one of just six prepresentatives on hand for today 's secret meeting .
With just 11 days before the proposed cancellation date , there are no plans for further bargaining sessions .
Stern , and u nion director Billy Hunter now have met twice without making any real progress since Wednesday , when Stern set January 7 as the date he would advise NBA owners to vote to cancel the entire season .
" On behalf of the Players Association , we presented a c omprehensive proposal to the NBA , " Hunter said in a statement .
" The league responded with a counter and we indicated to them our willingness to negotiate further .
Unfortunately , they were not inclined to do that . "
NBA players have been locked out by owners since July 1.
Both Stern and Hunter have taken time away from their holiday vacations to meet twice in the last five days .
Stern called the meeting an " attempt to salvage the season " .
" I really don n't think there will be a season , " said Jeffrey Mishkin , the league 's chief legal officer .
" We 've gone as far as we can go .
We 're done . "
Stern said : " In an attempt to salvage the season , we made additional improvements in our proposal by offering increases in the high-end limitation , the rookie salary scale , the percentage of revenue to be shared with the players and the minimum salary . "
The rookie scale still calls for teams to exercise an option for a fourth year of a player 's first contract or retain the right of first refusal without exercising the option .
However , that year would be at an increase of 25 percent .
The NBA 's last proposal called for the basketball-related income earmarked for the players at a rate of 52 percent , 52.5 and 53 percent over the final three years of the six-year deal .
Today 's proposal increased the BRI by 1 percent in those years , according to the union .
" We also proposed an additional exception to the salary cap and accepted the union 's 10 percent limitation on the escrow agreement , " Stern added .
In addition to a " middle-class " exception retained from the last proposal , the NBA added a $ 1 million bi-annual exception that had been part of the last agreement .
In each of its last two proposals , the NBA softened its stance on the escrow package , which now calls for up to 10 percent of player salaries to potentially cover any amount of total salaries above the BRI in the deal 's final three years .
" Unfortunately , this was not enough for the union , " Stern said .
The exact concessions offered by the union weren n't clear , although the players were thought to have changed their offer on a maximum salary to include all players with less than nine years ' experience instead of seven years ' experience .
The union said Hunter will discuss the union 's latest pro posal in detail Monday .
The meeting was attended by Stern , deputy commissioner Russ Granik , and special assistant Bob Lanier , and union 's representatives Hunter , president Patrick Ewing , and chief outside lawyer Jeffrey Kessler .
No further talks are scheduled , and a deal must be made by mid-January to salvage a 45 to 50-game schedule .
