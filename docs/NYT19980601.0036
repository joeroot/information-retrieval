SABRES RELAXED DESPITE TRAILING IN SERIES WITH CAPITALS

BUFFALO , N.Y .
_ The pressure is off of the Buffalo Sabres now .
There is no one outside of the Sabres ' locker room , not even the fans in Buffalo , according to coach Lindy Ruff , who expect the Sabres to come back against the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference finals .
And as if a huge weight had been lifted from their collective shoulders , the mood at Sunday 's practice was light , despite a discouraging 2 - 0 loss to the Capitals on Saturday night at Marine Midland Arena , a loss which put the Sabres down 3 - 1 , a game away from elimination from the NHL playoffs .
Instead of moping , casting their heads downward , or showing any of the telltale signs of surrender , the players filled Midland Arena with boisterous laughter as they skated through an easy workout , concentrating mostly on correcting the team 's struggling power play .
The Sabres went 0 - for - 7 with the man-advantage on Saturday .
Even Dominik Hasek , the Sabres goalie , who allowed a 70-footer into his goal on Saturday and subsequently took the brunt of the blame for the loss , was wearing a smile Sunday .
He was also wearing a sign made of tape on the front of his helmet .
It said , `` Sorrento , '' which is the name of a local cheese company .
Wait , there was more .
On the goalie 's back was written `` Kramer , '' as in the character from `` Seinfeld '' who Hasek resembles so much , but who also dislikes it when teased by his teammates .
Another sign on the back of Hasek 's jersey read , `` Swiss cheese , '' as in what Hasek resembled after allowing the Capitals ' Joe Juneau to score from behind the blue line .
It was Hasek 's strange _ and humorous _ way of apologizing for his miscue .
`` We wanted to have fun today , '' said Hasek , who has allowed nine goals in the last three games .
`` There are many holes in Swiss cheese .
It was fun for my teammates .
I like to make fun of myself sometimes .
It 's behind me now . ''
'' Dominik gets all of the credit for the success we 've had , '' said Ruff .
`` Now he 's also taking some of the blame .
He 's huge enough of a man to do that . ''
Hasek carried the Sabres during the regular season and in the early rounds of the playoffs , but has been criticized in the past for not playing well when the stakes are raised .
And Hasek has not been in form recently , allowing a few soft goals .
At least his attitude was good , an that was taken by his teammates as an encouraging sign .
`` There was no question Dominik was getting hammered on the radio , on television and in the newspapers about last night 's game , '' said Dixon Ward .
`` There are two directions you can go in when you 're getting barraged like that .
You can curl up and hide , or you can have fun with it .
We 're all proud of Dom for the way he is handling it . ''
Having fun , yes , they were doing that .
But the Sabres are certainly not waiving the white flag .
They have beaten the Capitals at the MCI Center .
And the Sabres know they are only one Hasek hot streak way from pulling to within one game of Washington .
`` The speech today was that three wins is not insurmountable , '' said Ruff .
`` We 're approaching this next game like we have three weeks left . ''
The feeling in the Sabres ' locker room was that the pressure has now shifted to the Capitals , who were the higher-seeded team and are haunted by their long history of failure in the playoffs .
`` We know that , '' said Matthew Barnaby , who upset the Capitals with his taunts and post-goal celebration in Game 2 at the MCI Center .
`` It definitely plays in our minds . ''
