DELTA-BRAZIL _ Delta Air Lines is being asked to buy a chunk of Transbrasil , its marketing partner in Brazil .

TECHNOBUDDY _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on Microsoft 's original schedule of June 25 .
The publicity about the company 's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping sales .
After all , most home users will figure a program that attracts so many headlines must be danged important .
So my job today is to urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first month or so .

CYBERSCENE02 _ Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers and the Internet on a daily basis , Web sites do a much better job of representing the non-technical side of life .
Take fishing , for instance .
You 'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area ; tell you about the hottest lures ; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well .

MACREPORT02 _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing software developers back to the Macintosh .
It is they who will make or break this computer .
With useful , entertaining and progressive software , the Mac will thrive again .
It won n't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the platform .
Without developer support , the Mac will be like a jilted suitor , all dressed up with nowhere to go .

TECHREPORT02 _ It 's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of compact discs , pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for , pop it into the CD player and hit play .
But wouldn n't it be nice to just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing ?
You can , if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player .

TECHTOOLS-COLUMN02 _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer programs , with more than 1 million copies sold .
It is an excellent program , but my wife , Donna , the genealogist , believes much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs that come with the deluxe version .
( Warner , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) MOVED
MARKET-TECHNICIANS02 _ Score one for the technicians .
These are the stock market wizards who practice technical analysis , an approach based on the idea that supply and demand explain the price movements of a stock or the entire market .
Technicians look at factors that can be quantified , such as volume , the number of new highs and new lows , price-to-earnings ratios , 200-day moving averages and a host of others .
( Walker , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) MOVED
CONSUMERWATCH _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct mail and telemarketing lists ?
There are many ways , easy ways , to get on the lists .
To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so simple .

SHARP-COLUMN _ For many people , the most frustrating part of vehicle ownership is getting quality service at a fair price .
Because most of us are not certified automotive technicians , when we talk to our technician about vehicle repairs , it 's not unlike trying to feel knowledgeable about dealing in rocket science .
Normally , I feel confident about automotive topics , but a recent experience proved that under some circumstances , I can be just as lost at the repair shop as the next guy .
( Sharp , Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) MOVED
MONEYTALK02 _ A report last week from an educational trade association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of the cost of college tuition .
But a second look shows that we actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just tuition _ of a year in college .
The American Council on Education 's study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages $ 3 , 111 .
In a telephone poll , respondents guessed an average of $ 9 , 694 .
That guess is not far off from the total cost , including tuition , books , room and board , transportation and other expenses .
According to the College Board , that total is $ 10 , 069 .
