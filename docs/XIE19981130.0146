McGeoch 's Resignation Sparks IOC 's Warn on SOCOG
CANBERRA , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The International Olympic Committee 's head coordinator for the 2000 Olympics warned Sydney Olympic Games organizers to expect problems in Sydney Olympics , according to reports from Sydney .
Jacques Rogge 's comments came after Rod McGeoch , an important member of the Sydney Games ' ( SOCOG ) organizing board , resigned last week .
Conflicts within the board were obvious after other members claimed that McGeoch , also the hero who brought the 2000 Games to Sydney during the bid in 1993 , charged a fee to address the preparatory work for the Games .
Of course , McGeoch denied the allegation .
His resignation shocked the IOC and became the climax of the event .
Rogge believed that McGeoch 's quit would bring about great loss to SOCOG and other bickering and turmoil would loom on the rugged and rough road to 2000 Olympic Games .
