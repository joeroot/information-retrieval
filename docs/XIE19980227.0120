OAU to Send Team to Comoros
ADDIS ABABA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The ongoing 67th ordinary session of Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) has decided to dispatch a ministerial delegation to Comoros .
It is aimed at impressing upon the secessionists Anjouanese to realize the importance of the territorial integrity and unity of Comoros , and to make them continue with the OAU-brokered dialogue as a way of finding a lasting solution to the problem , according to a press release issued by the session on Friday morning .
The session made the decision when it deliberated on situations in Comoros , Sierra Leone , Burundi , Somalia and Angola under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister of Tanzania Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete Thursday afternoon and evening .
The OAU session expressed grave concern over the situation in Comoros especially with the intransigence and lack of cooperation by Anjouanese and decided to dispatch the ministerial delegation to Comoros composed of Tanzania , Egypt , Madagascar , Kenya , Mozambique , Mauritius and South Africa as well as Zimbabwe as current OAU chairman and Burkina Faso as incoming chairman .
The release said , the session agreed that if the Anjouanese continued to defy international appeals , they should be isolated and meanwhile the OAU should work in collaboration with the countries in the region and the international community with a view to preserving the territorial integrity and unity of Comoros .
The 67th ordinary session is expected to be concluded later Friday after adoption of a series of resolutions on African political and socio-economic issues .
