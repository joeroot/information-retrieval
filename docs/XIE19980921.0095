China 's Cinemas ( 2 )
When the government decided to introduce foreign blockbusters to stimulate the domestic market in 1995 , cinemas earned 740,000 yuan from the American True Lies in just 7 days .
They also set a daily box-office record of 120,000 yuan , with more than 5,000 movie-goers each day .
Revenues from the entertainment industry account for a major part of state revenues , says Huang Huilin , a film theory professor at Beijing Teachers ' University .
Although 70 percent of the domestic films are entertaining , they can hardly compete with foreign exports in earnings .
Every year , China produces some " major theme " films on historic events and great people , and government and factory employees make up most of the audience .
Cinemas need to provide up-to-date audio and video equipment , according to Huang Shixian , a movie critic , who says that most of the Chinese cinemas hardly compare with those in Hong Kong .
Using box office earnings for technological improvements is naturally suited to the market economy , Chen says .
Exciting films like Titanic and Deep Impact , which are being shown in Beijing now , bring huge returns to those advanced cinemas , and many viewers say that they go to excite their senses .
