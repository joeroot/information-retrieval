For more than 40 years , I have walked the fairways of the world behind the game 's greatest artists , playing in the most famous championships on the planet 's most storied courses .
During that time , golf has exploded , both as a spectator and a participant sport .
Why ?
To me , it has principally been the result of the sterling careers of certain players , and not Arnold Palmer alone .
I 'll be audacious enough now to list my top 10 players , whose achievements I have described on ABC and CBS during the past 40 years .
& UR ; The McKay Ratings & LR ; & QL ;
1.
Jack Nicklaus
Twenty majors in all .
Will anyone ever equal that ?
Tack on a total of 70 wins on the PGA Tour , two Walker Cup teams , six Ryder Cup teams ( twice captain ) , two U.S. Senior Open titles and a Senior PGA .
He intimidated his peers like no one since Bobby Jones .
Nicklaus was not , however , without his crushing defeats or his personal insecurities .
His toughest loss came at Pebble Beach in the 1982 U.S. Open .
At the age of 42 , he had finished his final round of the championship and was standing beside the scorer 's tent waiting to be interviewed as the first player ever to win five U.S. Opens , if Tom Watson bogied either of the last two holes .
And Watson was in trouble , his ball sitting in long grass behind the green of the par three 17th .
From our tower at 18 , I looked down on Nicklaus .
He was staring at a monitor showing Watson lining up his shot .
From the difficult lie , it might well run far across the green , leaving him a likely bogie and setting up victory for Jack .
But Watson made `` the shot heard round the world , '' knocking the ball into the hole for a birdie .
In that instant , as he stood just below me , Jack 's expression was not his usual ironic half-smile of defeat , but a look of total shock and deep disappointment , the face of a stricken youngster , not of the most famous golfer in the world .
2.
Arnold Palmer
To understand Arnold Palmer and his endless appeal to Everyman , it helps to sit with him as I did at the home ( in Latrobe , Pa. ) he and his wife , Winnie , have lived in for more than 35 years and understand that he IS Everyman .
He still loves to sit by the pool , looking down toward the course he grew up on , just at the bottom of the hill .
That day some four or five years ago , he smiled and told me how he used to lie outside his family 's house on the edge of the course and wait for the woman to come by the sixth hole -- the woman who always gave him a nickel if he would hit her ball over the water hazard for her .
`` I can see myself now when I was really small , '' he said .
`` Making sure my dad couldn n't see me because I wasn n't allowed on the course . ''
I once asked Arnold Palmer how he has kept such a hold on his fans .
He looked at me , a faint smile on his face .
`` Jim , '' he said , `` maybe it 's because they understand who I am .
I think I am an honestly sensitive and sentimental person .
Maybe they sense that I care a great deal about what I do and that their encouragement means a lot to me . ''
3.
Lee Trevino
My most vivid memory of Trevino in his heyday is at the 1972 British Open on the Muirfield links in Scotland .
It could have been the pro-am preceding the Quad Cities Open as far as his attitude was concerned .
He kept up a running conversation , or more properly a monologue , with the Scottish gallery all the way around .
Standing on one tee , he turned to the crowd and said , `` They took me to an old castle for dinner last night .
We had food like they ate back in the old days , and we ate like they did -- with our fingers .
Heck , back home in Texas I even have a cat I taught to eat with a fork ! ''
Then he laughed and knocked his tee shot in his usual left-to-right arc into the middle of the fairway .
4.
Tom Watson
Of his remarkable five British Open victories , four of them were won by a single shot , one in a playoff .
If Nicklaus was the greatest and Palmer the most charismatic of championship golfers , certainly Tom Watson , as he plays on in his late 40s , still convinced that he will win another major , is the most tenacious .
5.
Gary Player
In July of 1954 , at the age of 18 , Gary Player stepped off a train at a small town in Scotland , carrying a cardboard suitcase held together with a piece of rope .
Since that day , he has become the world 's most traveled athlete , flying around the globe year after year , winning the national championships of the United States , Great Britain , Australia , Chile , and Brazil , among others .
His dedication to fitness and proper diet borders on the fanatical , and some of his beliefs approach the mystical .
In the earlier days , he would usually dress totally in black .
`` Why ? ''
he was asked .
`` It must be terribly hot . ''
`` Yes , '' he replied , `` but it makes me feel strong . ''
6.
Greg Norman
I feel uncomfortable not placing Greg Norman in my top bracket .
Today , he is probably the best-known golfer in the world , having won 55 tournaments internationally , as well as 16 on the American tour .
But ...
Every great player has performances he would rather forget , but Greg 's have come in the spotlight of major championships and have come in such dramatic fashion that they dominate his image , despite all his achievements .
7.
Seve Ballesteros
His emergence was sudden , his impact enormous , his downfall unforeseen and shocking .
What happened ?
No one knows , although some theorists blame imperfections in his swing , others the explosive nature of his character .
But it seems to be over for Seve at age 40 , unless he can pull some middle-aged miracles as he creeps toward 50 and the Senior Tour .
His impact on the game remains , however .
It was his play that forced expansion of the Ryder Cup matches from the U.S. versus Great Britain and Ireland to the U.S. versus all of Europe .
As a result , the matches , have become an increasingly competitive and major event .
8.
Nick Faldo
He has not yet joined the pantheon of the game , partly because of his rather phlegmatic personality and , in the minds of some people , because of his reliance on a golfing guru named David Leadbetter , who completely rebuilt Nick 's swing and follows him around the course and to the practice tee as if Faldo were still a student , not a champion .
At times , I have found myself thinking , Can you imagine Ben Hogan being followed every step of his career by a coach ?
9.
Ray Floyd
How 's this for career longevity ?
He was only 18 when he turned pro 35 years ago .
Now , as he nears his mid-50s , he is still winning on the Senior Tour and occasionally returning to the regular tour to instruct his juniors by example on how to play the game with skill and dignity .
10 .
To round out my top 10 , I 'll have to resort to that old cop - out , a tie .
In this case , a three way tie , among Ben Crenshaw , Tom Kite and Hale Irwin .
Now what shall I do about Tiger Woods and Ernie Els ?
All three of the world 's famous championships were won in ' 97 by men in their 20s ; Woods , 21 , the Masters ; Els , 27 , the U.S. Open ; and Leonard , 25 , the British Open .
Might one of them be the new Nicklaus or Palmer ?
Possibly .
But as far as ranking any of them , I can only echo the comment made long ago by Red Smith .
After Willie Mays had turned in his second great season in the majors , someone asked Red if he thought Mays was as good as Joe DiMaggio .
`` Come back and ask me that in 20 years , '' he said , `` and I 'll tell you . ''
