CHEEVER MAKING HIS MARK IN IRL AS DRIVER , CAR OWNER
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By JOHN STURBIN c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
FORT WORTH , Texas _ As proud as he was of his victorious drive in the 82nd Indianapolis 500 last Sunday , Eddie Cheever was even more pleased for his car owner .
That , too , is Eddie McKay Cheever Jr. , one of only three owners / drivers competing in the fledgling Pep Boys Indy Racing League .
Born in the United States but reared in Italy , Cheever qualifies as the IRL 's resident international playboy .
Handsome , introspective and opinionated , Cheever is fully capable of articulating the attributes of his two-car team in English , Italian and French .
`` Parlez-vous '' crankcase ?
You betcha .
`` I am in this to win , '' said Cheever , who scored his second career Indy-car victory _ both as owner / driver _ in the world 's most prestigious auto race May 24 .
`` I am in this for Team Cheever to win .
`` Is that ego ?
No. I have not met a decent racing driver that ( A ) likes to lose and ( B ) does not want to make sure that all the attention in the team is on himself . ''
As owner / driver , Cheever is doubling up on the attention and the aggravation inherent in professional motorsports .
His off-season was largely occupied by the search for a replacement primary sponsor after the defection of FirstPlus Financial to the NASCAR Winston Cup ranks .
Enter Rachel 's Potato Chips , a Minneapolis-based company looking to forge a national identity .
Rachel 's jumped onto the sidepods of Cheever 's black and blue Dallara chassis a week before the Indy 500 .
Improbably , Rachel 's rode with Cheever into victory lane at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
During the winter , Cheever opted to change chassis manufacturers , from G Force to Dallara , because the latter offered more technical expertise .
And in the IRL 's version of Tire Wars , he pledged allegiance to Goodyear at a time when Firestone rubber was hot , hot , hot .
`` They were all difficult decisions to make , '' Cheever said during a promotional visit to Texas Motor Speedway , which is scheduled to play host to the second annual True Value 500-kilometer race Saturday night .
`` As the team owner , it was gratifying to see that most of the decisions were right .
It 's very special . ''
Befitting his European upbringing , Cheever spent 11 years competing in Formula One _ road racing 's most technologically advanced series _ for a variety of teams .
But he didn n't win an F1 race in 133 starts , finishing a career-best second on two occasions .
Ironically , he took to oval-track racing in the States almost immediately in 1990 , when he joined Chip Ganassi Racing in the Championship Auto Racing Teams Series .
Cheever qualified 14th for his first Indy 500 that year and completed 193 of 200 laps en route to an eighth-place finish .
The performance earned him rookie of the year honors .
Cheever proved that was no fluke by also capturing CART 's rookie of the year award at the end of the full season .
In subsequent years , however , Cheever labored as a journeyman for team owners John Menard and A.J. Foyt .
They were tours of duty that convinced him it was time to change gears .
`` I was getting really tired of racing for teams and seeing things I thought were wrong , '' said Cheever , 40 , of Tampa , Fla. `` And it wasn n't correct for me to be insisting on those changes because it wasn n't my responsibility .
My responsibility was to drive .
`` But I learned a lot from A.J. Foyt , on how to work around people and how to work on an oval .
John Menard and his team ...
I worked for Ferrari and Renault in Formula One and there were so many different things that I have seen and done that I wanted to implement . ''
FirstPlus Team Cheever made its debut in 1997 .
That was the second year of the IRL , founder and Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George 's vehicle designed to make open-wheel racing more affordable and competitive while returning the sport to its traditional all-oval roots .
Cheever said he , rookie teammate Robby Unser , native Texan Greg Ray and the sometimes curious mix of IRL near-names and no-names nevertheless are proof that the series ' concept is viable .
`` We 're the Indy 500 winners , and we broke every business rule in the world with our racing team , '' said Cheever , who scored his first IRL victory in the rain-shortened Indy 200 in Orlando , Fla. , in January 1997 .
`` We dove into the swimming pool because I promised everybody that water would be in the pool , and that we wouldn n't hit bottom .
We were underfinanced .
We went and bought cars and engines and did everything we could to be as competitive as we could because we believed the structure would allow us to compete .
`` There was a lot of faith in what we did . ''
The list of true believers in Team Cheever includes business partner / publisher Clyde Perlee , team manager Dick Caron and crew chief Owen Snyder .
`` On the race weekend I am probably third on the hierarchy , '' Cheever said .
`` Dick Caron runs the company .
He has 15 years experience .
The technical running of the car is done by Owen . ''
Snyder was crew chief for Al Unser Jr. in 1992 , when `` Little Al '' posted the first of two Indy 500 victories .
`` This win is more satisfying because it 's a much smaller group , '' said Snyder , then employed by Galles Racing International and a member of CART 's upper crust .
`` Eddie and myself were working on this car .
We did not over-engineer the car _ because we did not have an engineer .
It was up to Eddie and I to make the best of what we had , and use our experience .
That 's how we 're competitive . ''
Arie Luyendyk , who has won Indy 500s before and after the CART-IRL divorce , said Cheever is perseverance personified .
Complete with Gucci loafers .
`` Eddie has taken a lot of criticism over the years , '' said Luyendyk , defending champion of the True Value 500 K.
`` He 's thick-skinned .
He 's been with bad teams and always saw it through .
He drove a great Indy 500 and he 's a very deserving winner .
I 'm really happy for Eddie . ''
Team Cheever is working within the parameters of what the owner said is a $ 5 million budget _ middle-of-the-pack by IRL standards but merely chump change for CART 's juggernauts .
`` From a business point of view , there is not a better value in sports right now than the IRL , '' said Cheever , who has an estimated $ 3 million in equity in his team .
`` In the IRL they 've set levels where it 's not possible to have that big of an advantage over everybody else .
So strategy will come into play again .
`` Our race in Indy was won on strategy .
We decided what strategy to use two months before we went to Indy .
I know it 's not going to pay off every time we go there , but we guessed the tires , we guessed the temperatures right , we guessed the car right , we guessed how many revs we had to run the Aurora engine at _ and everything worked .
`` You get everything right , it is possible for any driver to win races .
I did win at Indy , and it was a time where I probably had the best car and the best team of my whole career on that one weekend .
I 'm very proud that , as a team , we 've been able to compete .
Damn right I am . ''
