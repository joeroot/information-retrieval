DELHI _ With the detonation of two more nuclear devices in Baluchistan Saturday , Pakistan 's declared number of tests is now seven _ two more than India 's this year .
The demand of my Karachi taxi driver two weeks ago for `` six tamashas '' ( dazzling exhibitions ) to outdo India 's five was thus gloriously fulfilled , and the ferocious sibling rivalry between the world 's two newest nuclear weapons states was acted out on the biggest and most fearful stage of all .
India and Pakistan are not conventional enemies , militarily or in any other sense .
A sort of malignant magic seems to entwine the two countries , tainting and poisoning their endeavors , shackling them to one another , hobbling their destinies , forcing them endlessly into confrontation .
Never better than cool , their relationship is more tortured than comparable enmities _ North and South Korea , East and West Germany _ across borders of the Cold War .
One reason for that is the religious divide which led to the creation of Pakistan .
The ghosts of the hundreds of thousands on both sides who died during the Partition that brought the two states into existence half a century ago seem to haunt them still .
After India conducted its nuclear tests , Pakistan followed suit as quickly as possible .
That much was predictable : the neighbors have , after all , fought three wars in the past 50 years , all of which Pakistan has lost .
But less readily understandable was Pakistan 's need to outdo India .
And just as shocking to the outside world was the popular excitement and enthusiasm that the tests generated in both countries .
In Islamabad , as in Delhi two weeks ago , people were dancing in the streets , letting off firecrackers and handing out round ladoos , traditional sweets .
Foreigners , myself included , were aghast .
How could such horrendous events be greeted with the mad glee of a victory at cricket ?
I settled on ignorance as the likely explanation : the common people simply didn n't know how vile these weapons were .
But even well-educated people manifested the same sort of emotion .
Clearly , the vileness contributed to the glee .
The people were deeply glad that India had got in such a low blow to their bitter enemy .
Pakistanis were deeply glad that Pakistan had got in a low blow back .
In Korea as in Germany , Cold War real politik drew cruel , arbitrary lines through real countries , cutting families in pieces , destroying lives and communities .
The creation of Pakistan was similarly cruel and arbitrary , but because it derived in part from the will of the inhabitants , not the dictates of superpowers , its aftermath has been infinitely more neurotic and convoluted .
At places along the Line of Control , the cease-fire line that divides the state of Jammu and Kashmir , only 60 feet divide the Indian and Pakastini troops , who have been eyeball to eyeball for nearly 50 years .
Almost every day people get shot and killed by one side or the other , but in 49 years , that line has not moved one inch .
At Wagah , the border post in Punjab , the lowering of the Indian and Pakistani flags each day is accompanied by an elaborately orchestrated frenzy of stamping and goose-stepping and glaring by soldiers of the two sides , a sort of spastic , formalized cockfight , a vicious ballet of hostility .
Of course it could not have been choreographed without their intimate cooperation .
At the same border post each Aug. 14 for the past few years , on the eve of the anniversary of both countries ' independence , a hundred or more Indian peaceniks troop as close to the border as they can get , to sing songs of friendship and conciliation to the other side .
The plan is that an equivalent group arrives at the other side at the same time , and together they sing of the hopes of dissolving the barriers that divide them .
But it never seems to work out .
The Pakistani side fails to show up , or the no-man 's - land in between is too wide and the voices do not carry , or the guards break the gathering up .
In 50 years , the sane and sensible desire to come together and clasp hands has gained very little momentum .
One persuasive view of the relationship _ and it 's not the monopoly of Indians _ is that Pakistan was just a ghastly mistake .
In Lahore last week a senior Pakistani journalist spelled it out to me very clearly .
`` In my opinion , '' he said , `` the British should never have come to India .
But seeing as you did come , you shouldn n't have left so quickly .
If , instead of rushing off in 1947 , you had stayed for another 20 years , things might have been very different . ''
Pakistan , for a start , might never have existed .
Large areas both in the northwest and the east of British India had Muslim majorities .
During the decades of struggle for freedom , tensions between Muslim and Hindu leaders within the freedom movement led to demands for a measure of autonomy within free India for these regions .
But the demand for a wholly independent state only gathered force as late as 1940 .
As the negotiations leading to independence unfolded , Lord Mountbatten tried hard to persuade the Muslim side that they should throw in their lot with a united India .
But the Muslim leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah 's position hardened , and with its self-imposed deadline of 15 August 1947 , Britain had little room for maneuver .
Pakistan was composed of all the Muslim majority regions in both the northwest ( West Pakistan ) and the east ( East Pakistan ) The borders between the new , bifurcated state and India were drawn up by in furious haste by the British lawyer , Sir Cyril Radcliffe .
As preparations for the inauguration of the two fresh-minted countries went ahead , it was assumed that their creation would be pacific , the borders themselves porous , and that comings and goings between them would be unhindered .
No one expected the baptism of blood that transpired .
As the new borders became known , the first great disaster of the postwar era got under way , as hundreds of thousands of people were massacred , and millions more fled their homes to cross the border .
Perhaps one million people died , and 12 million were uprooted .
It was an ominous beginning .

From the start , Pakistan 's identity was disturbingly one-dimensional : as the only artificially created Islamic state in history , exaggerated Islamic piety became its hallmark , and Pakistani governments have long been vulnerable to the shrill demands of religious extremists .
During the past three weeks it has inevitably been the minority religious parties that have been clamoring most vociferously for nuclear tests .
With its vastly greater size , wealth , and cultural and religious variety , India should have a far more mature and confident political persona than Pakistan .
But decades of poor economic performance and internal political strife , and the chronic fear that the state might disintegrate into Pakistan-like chunks , have sapped the self-confidence that India projected under Nehru .
The former Indian Prime Minister , Inder Kumar Gujral , complained recently that he had sought to steer India away from perennially defining itself in terms of its rivalry with Pakistan , but that the nuclear tests had revived old habits .
Now the Hindu nationalists are in power , and their chauvinism and paranoia mirrors that of Pakistan .
Locked in mortal combat , the two fearsome siblings are on the lip of disaster .
