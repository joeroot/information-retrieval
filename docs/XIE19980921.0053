India Rules Out Roll Back of Nuclear Weapons Program
NEW DELHI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- India Monday ruled out any roll back of the nuclear weapons program .
The total yield generated by three simultaneous explosions in May comprising a hydrogen bomb , an atom bomb and a sub-kiloton nuclear device , was 60 kilotons , said Scientific Adviser to the Defense Minister P. J. Adbul Kalam .
India had come a long way since it conducted its first nuclear test in 1974 as the country 's scientists had been working on the data base to improve the design of nuclear weapons and modernize them , he said .
Kalam , who is also chief of Defense Research and Development Organization ( DRDO ) , said that the required data have been obtained through the five nuclear tests in May this year for carrying out simulation for future development by the scientists and technologists .
The country had several super computers in various research institutions including the Atomic Energy Commission and there would be no hurdle on this score , he added .
India by signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) would not face any difficulties in its nuclear weapons program since the country has generated the desired data from its recent nuclear tests .
" We are capable of conducting underground sub-critical tests after signing the CTBT , if necessary , " he said .
" From the scientific and technical angle , it is our considered view that no further nuclear tests are necessary and subscribing to the CTBT would not create difficulties for our nuclear status , " he added .
