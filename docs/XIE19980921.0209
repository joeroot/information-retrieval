ASEC Abidjan Beat Rangers in African Champions ' League
CAIRO , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- ASEC Abidjan beat close rivals Manning Rangers 3 - 1 in Abidjan on Sunday to extend their lead in the race for an African Champions ' League final place .
Reda Ereyahi scored four goals in a span of 17 minutes to pace defending champions Raja Casablanca for a 6 - 0 victory over Young Africans of Tanzania , setting a record in the competition .
On Saturday in group A , Dynamos of Zimbabwe continued their surprise start with a 1 - 0 defeat of Tunisia 's Etoile Sahel and lead by a point from Nigerian champions Eagle Cement at the halfway stage .
Eagle Cement beat Hearts of Oak from Ghana 1 - 0.
ASEC led 2 - 0 early in the second half through goals from Ivorian international Sidi Badra Aliou and Donald-Olivier Sie but quickly found their lead cut as Rangers scored with a flying header from Solomuzi Ndimande in the 52nd minute .
Two brilliant saves from Losseni Konate kept Rangers at bay and ASEC made safe the points with a 74th minute strike from Maxime Gouamene , returning to the team after a one-game suspension .
The win extended ASEC 's 100 percent record in the mini-league and gave them a five-point gap lead at the top of the standings in group B.
Raja Casablanca are third after recording the first win of their mini-league thanks to diminutive Ereyahi .
The Moroccan team led at half-time through Mustapha Moustadouia but should have made greater use of the advantage of playing against 10 men for much of the game .
Young Africans had veteran fullback Kenny Mkapa sent off on 37 minutes but did well to hold out until the last 15 minutes when their defence collpased .
Ereyahi , after missing a succession of earlier chances , scored four on the trot and Noureddine Ziyati added a sixth with a penalty five minutes into injury time for a record win in the Champions League .
The victory puts Raja back in contention but they will have to win all three of their remaining matches to have any chance of reaching December 's final ahead of ASEC .
Dynamos also had to play with 10 men for a long spell in their game in Harare against Tunisia 's Etoile Sahel but Harlington Shereni 's 40th minute penalty was enough to give them victory .
The next round of matches in the Champions League will be played on the weekend of October 9 - 11 .
