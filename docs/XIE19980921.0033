Sudanese President Rejects U.S. Threats of New
KHARTOUM , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir Sunday reiterated Sudan 's right to respond forcefully to any new U.S. attacks , other than resorting to the U.N. Security Council and other international organizations .
Addressing a huge mass rally on the occasion of the lapse of one month since the U.S. air strike against a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum , al-Bashir categorically rejected new threats by the U.S. to launch new strikes against his country .
The U.S. launched the attack on the factory on the ground that it manufactures chemical weapons agents for terrorists .
The Sudanese government insists the plant only produces antibiotics .
The sudanese president said that the U.S. threats were issued under the pretext that Sudan is hosting terrorist groups to undermine American interests worldwide .
Al-Bashir underlined that such threats do not intimidate the Sudanese nation .
Instead , they will rather enhance the nation 's strength , determination and will to confront aggression and provocations , he added .
Such threats will also further the nation 's belief and adherence to its economic development plans and political efforts , he said .
Al-Bashir revealed that the message received by the Sudanese government from the U.S. administration threatened to hit Sudan in case of any attacks against American interests and facilities all over the world .
He said that Sudan 's hostility to the U.S. emanates from Washington 's attempts to impose hegemony on Sudan and to force the Sudanese people to abandon their religion and independent decision-making .
It was reported that a U.S. government official conveyed a message to a Sudanese official , which holds Sudan responsible for any attack against U.S. citizens anywhere in the world .
It demanded the expulsion of terrorism elements from Sudan or handing them over to stand trial in the U.S. or any other country .
