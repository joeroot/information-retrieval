Cyprus Revokes License of a Russian Bank
NICOSIA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The Central Bank of Cyprus has revoked the license of the Russian-financed Inkombank and obtained a court order to liquidate its international banking unit in Cyprus .
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Thursday that the move was taken after Inkombank failed to meet its obligations .
A Central Bank statement said the decision to revoke the license , granted in July 1993 , was made on November 18 .
" The bank has not been able to meet its obligations and liabilities , " said Andreas Philippou , the Central Bank 's chief senior manager .
Inkombank was one of five Russian banks operating in Cyprus , which include one that is fully owned by the Russian Central Bank .
Inkombank was heavily involved in retail banking before Russia 's financial crisis erupted last August .
Earlier this year , it significantly raised its profile in Cyprus by launching an advertising campaign in the local media on its high interest rates on fixed-time , dollar-denominated deposits .
Philippou said that operations of the four other Russian banks in Cyprus were proceeding normally .
