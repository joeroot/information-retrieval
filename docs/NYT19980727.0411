JETS-PACKERS CONNECTION HELPS OUT BOTH TEAMS

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ They winter a few houses apart in Florida , but Monday , Ron Wolf and Bill Parcells stood a few feet apart and appraised the New York Jets on the practice field .
Often , Parcells would ask Wolf 's opinion and Wolf would ask Parcells about a certain player .
What was the Packers ' general manager , the architect of the team that defeated Parcells ' Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI , doing at the Jets ' training camp ?
For the last few years , going back to Parcells ' New England days , Wolf has made an annual visit to see how his good buddy 's team is stacking up .
In return , Parcells dispatches one of his staff ( this year it will be the Jets player personnel director Dick Haley ) to DePere , Wis. , where the Pack practices .
It has proved to be a symbiotic relationship .
Two key Jets pickups last year came from the Packers .
The week before the season started , the Jets acquired Jerald Sowell on waivers from Green Bay .
Haley had seen Sowell in practice and was impressed , and now Sowell is competing for the Jets ' starting fullback post with Keith Byars .
The other player was Chris Hayes , acquired in a trade for Carl Greenwood .
Hayes immediately became one of the Jets ' top three or four special-teams players .
The Packers also acquired tight end Tyrone Davis , whom the Jets sent as part of an earlier deal .
`` It 's not that we 've got exactly the same football philosophy , '' Parcells said .
`` But I respect his opinion and I 'll ask him what he thinks about a player . ''
Wolf , who does not visit any other National Football League team , said : `` I have a tremendous respect for Bill .
I have trust for him that most people in this business wouldn n't have for one another . ''
That trust , as well as a mutual admiration for the history of football and an interest in military heroes , has forged a long friendship .
Wolf , who spent a year as the Jets ' assistant general manager under Dick Steinberg in 1991 , said he agreed with the deal with New England that made Curtis Martin a Jet .
`` Any time you can get a Curtis Martin for a first - and third-round draft pick , you have to do that , '' he said .
`` He 's the third - or fourth-best back in the NFL after Barry Sanders and Terrell Davis . ''
Wolf noted that `` in visiting with Bill today , he seems fired up , he seems rejuvenated . ''
He added , `` I 'm sure he can coach for another four , five or six years . ''
While Wolf played down the likelihood that Monday 's visit would result in a trade _ `` I don n't think I 'd do that off a one-day visit '' _ he and Parcells each got the chance to bounce ideas off someone he respects .
And it gave Wolf a rare chance to see a prospective Packer closer than he would get to any other player on any other team in the league .
EXTRA POINTS
_ CURTIS MARTIN remained sidelined for a second day with his hamstring injury .
During practices , he works out with the conditioning coach , JOHN LOTT , to the side of the field .
Then he joins his teammates on the sideline .
Coach BILL PARCELLS still says : `` He 's doing better .
It 's not much .
He 'll be back in a short time . ''
_ SCOTT FROST will be tried as a kick returner even as he is trying to convert to safety after his quarterbacking days at Nebraska .
And DEDRIC WARD , a backup punt returner , is battling ALEX VAN DYKE as the third wide receiver after KEYSHAWN JOHNSON and WAYNE CHREBET .
.
.
.
Parcells said he is distressed with tight ends KYLE BRADY and FRED BAXTER .
`` Right now , tight end 's a little bit of a mess , '' the coach said .
He has made it an open competition between the incumbent , Brady , and Baxter .
_ MATT O ' DWYER , who said he merely finishes his blocks , had one of his annual tussles with a teammate .
The guard and defensive tackle ERNIE LOGAN exchanged a brief flurry of punches after O ' Dwyer blocked Logan .
On Saturday , O ' Dwyer sent JASON FERGUSON headfirst into a massive tire under one of the mobile camera towers .
The players were frozen for a few moments until Ferguson stirred .
_ Asked about REGGIE WHITE 's controversial off-season remarks about homosexuals and ethnic groups , Packers general manager RON WOLF said , `` Everybody 's entitled to their opinion but sometimes it 's time to shut your mouth . ''
