& HT ; By DOUGLAS FOSTER FROM : The New York Times Magazine & HT ; Jerry Brown teeters atop a table in an oakland cafe , his arms akimbo like a jack-in-the-box .
Surprise , it 's me !
It 's early on a Saturday morning , and droopy-eyed customers drift past him , bellying up to the counter .
But Brown won n't be ignored .
& HT ; `` Oakland has been on the verge of greatness for so long , it 's time to push it past the verge ! ''
he shouts as the black table wobbles beneath him .
& HT ; The cafe , called Brewberry 's , is wedged between storefronts in the city 's working-class Laurel District , one of the most integrated neighborhoods in one of the most diverse cities in the country .
Down the street are Cornerstone Missionary Baptist Church , Sun Sun Alterations and La Ultima Restaurant .
Inside the coffee shop , Brown , dressed in a black collarless shirt and black Gap pants _ denounces the power of moneyed interests in politics and `` the old boys network . ''
& HT ; It 's vintage Brown rhetoric .
This time , however , the `` old boys '' targeted by Brown are the blacks and Latinos who run Oakland 's City Hall .
& HT ; A woman in stretch pants finally speaks up , asking him , `` Why do you want the job ? ''
Brown leans toward her and shoots back , `` Because it will be a major contribution to political life in the whole country . ''
& HT ; He promises to limit the influence of lobbyists , generate `` full citizen participation '' in local government , enforce `` zero tolerance for crime , '' improve the schools , stimulate development , even spark a `` revitalized cultural life . ''
Brown rhapsodizes about `` the power of ideas , '' then asks , `` Anybody want to offer an idea ? ''
& HT ; When no one steps forward , he promptly fills the void .
`` Ideas have to be tested in the crucible of reality , '' he exclaims .
`` Oakland is the crucible of reality ! ''
& HT ; Why does Brown want to be mayor of a largely nonwhite city of just 388,000 people in which the post is a relatively weak one ?
Since Oakland is known more for the size of its underclass ( and its embrace of Ebonics ) than for the stature of its political leaders , many observers have sneered that the mayor 's office here is beneath Brown .
& HT ; But the pundits have it wrong .
In Oakland , crime is down , employment is up and there are signs of a long-delayed economic boom _ creating the possibility of a showcase turnaround .
Moreover , at 60 , how many more times can he mount unsuccessful bids for the presidency ?
Following years of high-flying talk _ he has even been a radio chat-show host lately _ Brown seems to want to ground himself , at last , in Oakland .
& HT ; If it 's clear why Brown wants to be mayor , the motivations of Oakland voters are murkier .
Brown is almost always met with a mix of familiarity and perplexity , the kind of reaction Mario Cuomo might encounter if he decided to run for mayor of Poughkeepsie .
In front of Brewberry 's picture window , an elderly Mexican-American woman doubts that Brown will stay long at City Hall if he 's elected .
& HT ; `` I worry about him winning and taking off , '' she says .
A middle-aged black woman proves more enthusiastic .
`` The black leadership hasn n't accomplished much , '' she says flatly , creasing her lips .
`` Brown can change the whole picture .
He 's energetic , dynamic .
Besides , he 's the Kennedy of California .
The native son can do what he wants , don n't you think ? ''
& HT ; Brown 's celebrity may grab headlines , but that is far easier than battling school boards or fighting the local drug trade .
And even some of his admirers worry that Brown _ a man so prone to pie-in-the-sky visions that he once earned the nickname Governor Moonbeam _ simply isn n't suited for the managerial challenges that face urban mayors today .
& HT ; Brown is a newcomer , having moved to Oakland in 1994 .
And this is a city where only a quarter of the residents are white ( 43 percent are black , 14 percent Latino and 14 percent Asian ) .
Not surprisingly , his opponents have portrayed him as an interloper .
& HT ; For much of its 146-year history , however , Oakland was run by a clubby conservative circle that produced only white mayors .
In the 1970s , around the time Jerry Brown began his first term as governor _ following in the footsteps of his father , Edmund G. Brown , who held the post between 1959 and 1966 _ the militant Black Panther Party shook things up with a series of voter-registration drives .
& HT ; In 1977 , Lionel Wilson , a judge , became the city 's first black mayor ; Wilson was followed in 1990 by Elihu Harris , a black state legislator .
( Harris chose not to run for a third term this year . ) Against this backdrop , Brown 's regular denunciations of `` mediocrity at City Hall '' during `` the past 20 years '' have hit a nerve .
& HT ; Exhibit A in Brown 's brief against the status quo is the costly deal that local politicians struck with Al Davis to lure the Raiders football team back to play in the Oakland Coliseum .
( The deal , aimed at giving the city 's anemic economy a shot in the arm , relied on inflated revenue estimates . ) Brown has called for a criminal investigation .
& HT ; `` Brown 's just playing to the cheapest seats , '' replies Mary King , one of his key opponents in the mayoral race .
King is a black woman who worked her way up from library aide to the powerful position of Alameda County Supervisor .
At a public forum , she vents , `` It 's a fascinating moment when a white man _ the son of a governor !
_ can accuse a woman who started out as a single mother on welfare of being too imbedded in the system . ''
& HT ; King places the blame for Oakland 's economic collapse in the 1980s on a California taxpayer revolt two decades ago _ when Jerry Brown was governor .
After passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 , state money for cities fell .
An economic skid grew into a sustained statewide recession , hitting Oakland particularly hard .
& HT ; `` Certainly we can take responsibility for not having done enough , for not having moved farther , '' King murmurs .
`` But it 's been uphill all the way . ''
& HT ; King is clearly frustrated by Brown 's popularity .
`` People have gotten caught up in a kind of ' white man 's ice is colder ' syndrome , '' she says acidly .
& HT ; Another of Brown 's chief competitors is a member of the City Council , Ignacio De La Fuente , an immigrant from Mexico who started out in Oakland as a dishwasher 27 years ago and rose through trade-union leadership ranks to become the city 's first Latino vice mayor .
In a drive around the city , De La Fuente animatedly points out a group of new town houses on the waterfront and the first new shopping center in his district , Fruitvale , in two decades .
& HT ; `` Ask anybody who pulled that out of the fire , '' he demands .
`` Saying and doing are two different things .
Jerry talks a good line about development and creating jobs .
But damn it , I 've been accomplishing what he only talks about . ''
& HT ; With California 's boom economy ratcheting up real-estate prices elsewhere , Oakland is the only major Bay Area city left with a surfeit of affordable space .
A decommissioned 422-acre Army base will be conveyed to the city soon , another plum opportunity .
There are also plans to dredge the port and expand the airport , fueling a potential job surge .
De La Fuente ticks off these facts , and winces at the idea of Brown in charge as they come to pass .
& HT ; `` I like Jerry , '' De La Fuente says .
`` But he just doesn n't have the attention span to be mayor . ''
& HT ; If a person 's home provides a window into his psyche , the $ 2 million warehouse that Jerry Brown built from the ground up in 1995 is a fascinating case study .
Stretched over a quarter block of land near Oakland 's waterfront , it looks austere from the outside , a vast expanse of corrugated steel .
& HT ; Inside , there 's 17,000 square feet to rattle around in , with a garden outside for organic vegetables .
It 's where Brown 's campaign was run _ from a series of cubicles along the left side of the room .
On the opposite side are two long wooden tables .
& HT ; `` Here 's the only thing about the whole place that matters to me , '' Brown says , waving his hand .
`` The monastic table _ to sit there and have conversations . ''
& HT ; Brown 's longtime friend , the French-born intellectual Jacques Barzaghi , painted a large red circle in the center of the floor downstairs _ `` to signify unity , '' he says , fingering his polished prayer beads .
Barzaghi , who has been part of Brown 's inner circle since his gubernatorial days , is a man with a gleaming shaved head given to sudden proclamations .
( `` Life is good ! ''
he regularly exclaims . ) & HT ; Barzaghi and his wife occupy one of 10 loft bedrooms upstairs .
Brown sleeps in a room down the way , and other political supporters and friends periodically bed down in the rest .
( Brown 's regular date for the past eight years , Anne Gust , is general counsel for the Gap ; she maintains her own home in San Francisco . ) It 's not your average Oakland politician 's digs .
& HT ; None of his opponents in the mayoral campaign made much of Brown 's living in a commune , perhaps because his unconventionality _ from his affair with the singer Linda Ronstadt while running for president in 1980 to his tendency to speak in long , vaguely oracular phrases _ has become , after all these years , familiar to Californians .
& HT ; Reporters continue to poke fun , however .
`` They write that I 'm quirky , '' he says , sounding genuinely flummoxed .
`` But the whole thing I 'm doing here is pure practical , nuts and bolts .
You 've been around .
Have you seen anything quirky ? ''
& HT ; One afternoon in the warehouse , Brown pulls out a worn album that his father kept under his bed .
The tattered clippings chronicle his father 's early career .
Jerry recites his father 's campaign slogan , laughing : `` ' Crack down on crime , pick Brown this time . ' Boy , some things never change . ''
& HT ; His father was an avuncular , beloved politician of the old school who made his reputation as a grand builder through the state 's high tide of economic expansion in the 1960's .
When the younger Brown dropped out of a Jesuit seminary in 1960 , he bided his time at law school and a clerkship , waiting to begin his own political hegira until 1969 , three years after his father lost his bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan .
& HT ; `` The point I 'm trying to make with all this , '' he says now , in a kind of reverie as he pages through his father 's scrapbook , `` is that Edmund G. Brown , father and son , have been involved in California politics since 1946 .
It 's an unbroken chain . ''
& HT ; This comment seems particularly surprising _ because after Jerry Brown leapfrogged in 1975 into the governor 's office while still in his mid-30s , he expressed icy disdain for 1960's Big Government spending on infrastructure and social programs , the hallmark of his father 's career .
& HT ; He openly decried `` the obvious manipulation and role-playing '' in his father 's style of politics .
Watching him embrace his father 's legacy so fully now , referring casually to their similarities , you can see how agile he is , how strong his penchant for reinvention .
& HT ; Brown regularly touts his experience as governor , citing `` the tremendous burst of creativity '' in state government during his years as chief executive .
But there 's the other side of history too _ notably , his reputation for poor administrative skills .
`` He 's absolutely the worst administrator I 've ever seen , '' says a former member of his cabinet .
& HT ; In any case , Brown himself admits that what 's required politically of a governor is vastly different from what confronts a mayor .
`` Being governor is much more abstract , '' Brown acknowledges .
`` This is upfront , in-your-face detail . ''
& HT ; Does Brown have the discipline _ and the consistency _ needed to slog through such details ?
& HT ; Shortly after he announced his candidacy in October , the media had a field day with an environmentalist manifesto commissioned by Brown and titled `` Oakland Ecopolis : A Plan for a Green Plan . ''
The plan upbraided advocates of `` mere economic growth , '' envisioning an `` ecologically friendly '' city where `` solar generators quietly hum '' next to `` farm kiosks and craft bazaars . ''
& HT ; This spring , however , he reined himself in , talking almost exclusively about crime , schools _ and economic development .
Pressed about this change , Brown bristles .
`` I do want to do a sustainability plan for Oakland , '' he says .
`` It 'll take a few years to do it .
But we 'll work it in there . ''
& HT ; As a newcomer who has only had a crash course in Oakland 's reality , I ask , can he really set the city 's political direction ?
`` Look , I could do something else _ like enjoy life , '' he says .
`` There 's everything here that I 've ever cared about _ poverty , environmental issues , labor , crime , schools , transportation .
In a concrete way , everything I 've been concerned about in my entire life is at issue in Oakland . ''
& HT ; Brown 's capacity for reinvention could flourish , or founder , in the pitted streets of Oakland .
A mayor in a city like Oakland is held responsible for the conditions in the schools and on the streets .
With hopes raised high , the citizens of Oakland are unlikely to cut him any slack once he 's in office .
Power seduces , but it also stings .
& HT ; Come next January , Jerry Brown had better know whom to call about those potholes .
