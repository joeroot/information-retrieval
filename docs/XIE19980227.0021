Investors ' Confidence Lowers in Zimbabwe : Bank
HARARE , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Investors ' confidence has reached its lowest ebb since the introduction of economic reforms by the government in 1991 following the recent economic and social developments in Zimbabwe , First Banking Corporation said Thursday .
In its inaugural monthly economic commentary , the bank said the economy was at crossroads with macro-economic instability at its peak as inflation hovers above 20 percent and the budget deficit projected to shoot to 12 percent of Gross Domestic Product .
Volatility on the foreign exchange market threatened to " wipe out commercial and industrial activities " , while interest rates ranged in the staggering regions of between 35 to 41 percent , the bank added .
" Unfortunately this dime around , the predicament our economy finds itself in is not caused by yet another drought , but by lapses in economic policy formulation and management of implementation processes , " it said .
Not only foreign investors have lost confidence in Zimbabwe , but local business people are also weighing the risks of setting up ventures in high density suburbs following the recent food riots which left a trail of destruction at shops in the areas , the bank said .
However , it said the launch of the second leg of economic reforms , code-named Zimbabwean program for economic and social transformation this year should mark the recovery of the economy .
The new reform is primarily aimed at restoring macro-economic stability by reducing government expenditure , interest rates , inflation and volatility on the foreign exchange market .
