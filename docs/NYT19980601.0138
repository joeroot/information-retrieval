`` Before I leave work , I call my wife to ask what our 5-year-old son , Will , has been up to , '' says Michael Johnson , a general manager at a printing company in Portland , Maine .
`` Then when I come home , I can tap right into Will 's world .
I 'll say , ` I hear you were running around with an eye patch playing pirate today . ' It lets him know I have been thinking of him . ''
Like Johnson , more fathers today are making a connection between their work life and their family life .
Nearly 70 percent of working men say that family is just as important as their job , or more important , according to a national Roper Organization survey .
As a result , many working dads are struggling to find the balance that was once thought to be only a mother 's problem .
In fact , 46 percent of fathers today say they don n't spend enough `` quality time '' with their children .
And when they 're unable to do this , 78 percent of men say they feel guilty , according to a survey of nearly 350 parents conducted at Ohio 's University of Toledo .
So in these times , it 's no longer enough to simply ask whether a working mother hurts her kids by being away from them most of the day .
We now also need to address the brand-new question : What are the consequences for families _ and businesses _ when fathers work ?
For years , it 's been a fact of life that dads ' jobs typically take them away from their children for more than eight hours a day .
It 's been through their work , through being good economic providers , that fathers have established their very identities and taken care of their families .
So it never occurred to families or employers that business should do anything _ aside from providing a paycheck _ to support men as fathers .
After all , why would it matter ?
Weren n't work and family separate worlds ?
The answer seems to be a resounding no. Over the past two decades , a new wave of research on child and family development , which had previously focused nearly exclusively on mothers , has begun to document the vital role that fathers play in their children 's lives .
This has led to a revolutionary understanding of working dads : A man 's dual roles as father and worker have an enormous impact on each other .
& UR ; HOW WORK AFFECTS FAMILY & LR ; & QL ;
`` Kids are the unseen stakeholders in the American workplace , '' says Stewart Friedman , director of the Wharton Life Interests Project at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
`` Fathers ' work is an unseen and underappreciated influence on children 's development . ''
Here are some surprising ways that a father 's work has impact , positive or negative , on his kids .
+ When fathers are satisfied with their jobs , their children have fewer problems .
Friedman and Jeffrey Greenhaus , professor of management at Drexel University in Philadelphia , found that children ages 4 to 17 whose fathers say they are satisfied with their work exhibit fewer behavioral problems such as shyness , withdrawal and aggressiveness .
`` When a dad is able to sit at the dinner table and talk about his work with a positive attitude , confidence and pride , that seems to rub off on his kids , '' Friedman says .
+ Too many or too few work hours affect children 's learning and development .
In a study of 3-to-6-year-old children undertaken at Ohio State University in Columbus , sociologists Toby Parcel and Elizabeth Menaghan , the authors of `` Parents ' Jobs and Children 's Lives '' ( Aldine De Gruyter , 1994 ) , found that a father 's unemployment may be linked to increased behavior problems such as whining , hitting and acting out .
Conversely , working sustained overtime _ not just putting in occasional long hours _ may also have a negative effect on children .
`` Often , vocabulary will not be as developed , '' Parcel observes .
When Dad is around , on the other hand , there are big benefits for kids , numerous studies show .
For example , at 6 months of age , babies with actively involved fathers score higher on an intellectual ability test , according to a study by F.A .
Pederson , author of the `` The Father-Infant Relationship '' ( Praeger , 1980 ) .
And for girls , feeling competent in math is linked to a close and warm relationship with their fathers , according to studies at the University of Michigan School of Social Work in Ann Arbor .
+ How a boss treats a father can affect how a father treats his kids .
Indianapolis-based art director Jeff Lovell , who has custody of his three children , often has to come in late to work for family reasons .
Fortunately , he has a supportive boss .
`` I would not be able to stay with the company , '' Lovell says , `` if they didn n't trust that I 'll always get the work done . ''
And that kind of autonomy on the job leads to higher self-esteem for a dad , according to researcher Karen Grimm-Thomas of Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
`` It 's likely that when parents see themselves succeed at work , they feel more confident as parents , '' she says .
`` And they are clearer about what they expect from their children , too . ''
& UR ; HOW FAMILY AFFECTS WORK & LR ; & QL ;
Do businesses value a man for being a good dad _ and show it in their policies ?
Not as often as dads would like .
Flextime is rarely an option .
Paternity leave is rarely paid .
And since men typically continue to earn more than women , it is usually not financially feasible for a father to take an unpaid leave even if a company offers it .
But good managers are at least beginning to recognize the interdependence of work and family .
At Corning Inc. in Corning , N.Y . , manager Ed O ' Brien lets his employees define their own schedules .
And he values the expertise good parents bring with them to work .
`` Empathy , listening skills , knowing how to teach others and how learning takes place _ all of these child-rearing practices are directly applicable to the workplace , '' O ' Brien says .
Indeed , a father who just returned to his job as a purchasing agent after taking paternity leave says that caring for his 4-month-old has given him a whole new way of listening to people .
`` I look more closely for nonverbal signals now , '' he says , `` and I can use this skill when I 'm talking with colleagues and customers . ''
When a company is sensitive to a father 's family responsibilities , dads want to keep working there .
Mike Dedek , a software engineer and father of three who works at Lexis-Nexis in Miamisburg , Ohio , says , `` My dedication to this company is primarily due to their family friendliness . ''
When a company 's policies and programs take family needs into account , employees are 45 percent more likely to `` go the extra mile '' for their employer , say researchers at Dupont in Wilmington , Del.
Not only do these kinds of programs increase worker dedication , but , as consultant Richard Federico of William Mercer Inc. in New York observes , `` When people are less stressed out , they tend to produce better on the job . ''
& UR ; ACHIEVING A BETTER BALANCE & LR ; & QL ;
How can you ease your own work-and-family juggling act , especially when you may not have the most enlightened of bosses ?
Here are some strategies .
+ Ask , don n't assume .
Think your bosses will never allow any adjustment in work schedule , or that they 'd interpret a family obligation as a lack of commitment to the job ?
If so , you might actually cheat yourself of what you need .
One father was hesitant to ask his supervisor if he could stay home with his son , who wasn n't feeling well , so his wife took time off from her own job .
The next day his boss _ a working parent herself _ happened to ask how things were going at home .
When he mentioned that his wife was at home with their sick child , the boss said , `` Why don n't you do your work at home if you need to ? ''
The moral of the story : If you don n't ask for what you need , you won n't get it .
+ Frame your request in terms of work .
Your boss doesn n't have to hear every detail of a family problem .
He or she just needs to be convinced that , in an emergency , you have a plan for getting your work done , such as doing it at home or having a colleague cover for you .
+ Use your human resources department .
HR professionals today often receive special training in helping employees negotiate sticky work / family issues .
So , again , ask for help .
+ Turn down extra work with business savvy .
As downsizing leads to bigger workloads , it 's increasingly important to know how to turn down work that might compromise your family 's needs .
One way is to present your boss with options for reprioritizing your work : `` I 'll be able to take on this assignment if I give up some other stuff on my plate .
Can we review my assignments and see what I might delay doing , or perhaps delegate to someone else ? ''
+ Find strength in numbers .
If you 're having work / family problems , it 's likely that your fellow employees are , too .
Chris Colbern , who supervises payroll services at Cigna , a Philadelphia-based insurance company , gathered a group of co-workers together to look at how other companies had implemented flextime .
The result : a new Cigna scheduling system that virtually all employees prefer .
It may not yet be the law of the land , but a member of the nation 's highest court is recognizing dads ' family needs .
In 1994 , shortly after her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked why she agreed to a flexible schedule for law clerk David Post , who was attending Georgetown University at night .
His wife , an economist , had a demanding job , so Post needed to care for their children during part of each day .
`` This is my dream of the way the world should be , '' Ginsburg said .
`` I was so pleased to see that there are indeed men who are doing a parent 's work , who do not regard that as strange .
`` People like David , I hope , will be role models for other men who may be fearful they won n't succeed in their profession if they spend time caring for their children or are concerned they will be thought of as less than a man if family is of prime importance . ''
