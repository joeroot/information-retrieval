( ATTN : N.J . ) CHINESE MEN INTERVIEWED IN SMUGGLING
( ja ) By SUSAN SACHS c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ As the authorities searched for the captain of the smuggling boat that ran aground Saturday night in New Jersey , investigators Monday began to interview its 22 Chinese passengers in the hope of learning who organized and profited from their flight .
The Immigration and Naturalization Service released little information about the detainees Monday , other than that they came from Fujian Province , the starting point for many of the illegal Chinese immigrants who have made the tortuous journey to American shores in recent years .
Officials said that investigators were still conducting separate interviews of the 22 men , the youngest of them 18 and the oldest 45 .
The men were being held at the INS detention center in Elizabeth , N.J . , where they will appear before immigration judges later this week and be charged with illegal entry into the United States .
At that point , usually the beginning of a long and complicated legal battle , they may ask for political asylum .
Speaking at a news conference in Washington , the INS commissioner , Doris Meissner , said the facts that were known about the men 's journey , although sketchy , fit into a pattern seen in other immigrant-smuggling cases .
`` At this point , we would operate on the supposition that they are connected to an organized-crime organization of some kind , '' she said , calling the Chinese-smuggling business particularly odious because it funnels hapless immigrants into sweatshop jobs where they are abused , exploited and overworked .
`` This is a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise played out on a global scale , '' Mrs. Meissner said .
Investigators were still searching for the captain and presumed owner of the boat , who slipped through police hands before anyone realized that the abandoned craft had unloaded a human cargo of illegal immigrants .
He was identified by the authorities as a 38-year-old Korean-American , Jason Choi , of Flushing , Queens .
His 30-foot fiberglass pleasure boat , the Oops II , ran aground at the end of Mount Street in Bay Head , one of the wealthiest towns on the Jersey Shore , and for the first three hours , the police treated the incident as little more than a case of a captain who had floundered in heavy fog and purposely beached his craft .
When he was questioned by state troopers at a phone booth near the boat , Choi identified himself as the owner and said he had lost his way while fishing and ran the boat up on the beach because he was running out of fuel .
John Hagerty , a spokesman for the state police , said that the registration documents for the boat were in order and that a check found no outstanding warrants for Choi .
Troopers even gave Choi a ride into downtown Point Pleasant .
When reports began to come in about Chinese men wandering around the town , the local police called the troopers again .

The aborted ride in the Oops II was probably the final leg of an arduous journey from China .
Typically , smuggling rings bring Asian immigrants across Eastern Europe or Southern Africa , then to South America , before heading up through the Caribbean or Central America to Mexico .
The boat itself offered few clues _ some blankets , water bottles and a few cans of the nutrient supplement Ensure , Bay Head Police Chief William Dikun said .
It was still unclear whether the 22 men , like so many before them , were destined to work off much of the $ 25,000 to $ 30,000 in smuggling fees in the sweatshops of New York City .
While many Fujian immigrants have risen to positions of political and economic power in the Chinese-American community in New York , the province , a hodgepodge mix of booming businesses and impoverished rural farms , also supplies the bulk of the underpaid and undocumented sweatshop work force .
`` It 's pretty common these days to go into one sweatshop or another , '' said Wang Lim , executive director of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association .
To help choke off the smuggling pipelines that bring in Asian and other illegal immigrants , the INS has opened 13 new offices around the world in the past three years in an effort to intercept them before they reach the United States .
