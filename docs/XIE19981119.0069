BAGHDAD , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraqi families whose children have become victims of U.N. economic sanctions rallied on Thursday , calling for removal of the more than eight-year-old embargo .

" Equilibre " Chairman Alain Michel stressed the need for putting an end to the embargo which had led to an increase in mortality rates among the Iraqi population , in particular the children .
Michael said his organization would exert the utmost to get the world public opinion acquainted with the size of suffering the Iraqis had seen .
Director General of Iraqi Children 's Culture House Raad Bandar said a massive number of letters were handed over to the house since 1994 with an authenticated information of hardships borne by Iraqi people under the harsh embargo .
