SHOCK !
HORROR !
JETS ARE THINKING PLAYOFFS
( nk ) By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .

What a difference a year makes if you play football for the New York Jets .
Here they are getting ready for their opening exhibition game at Philadelphia on Thursday night , and they think they are pretty good .
`` We 're thinking playoffs ; all of us are , '' quarterback Glenn Foley said .
`` I 've been around a while , '' added the oldest Jet , 37-year-old punter Brian Hansen , `` and it 's nice to finally think you 've got a chance . ''
But it was only 12 months ago that coach Bill Parcells led the Jets into their preseason opener ( also against the Eagles ) and before two minutes had elapsed , he wondered , `` I 've got 20 of these in a row , Parcells , how are we going to get this team better ? ''
That Jets team was trying to get the sticky legacy of a 1 - 15 record from 1996 off their shoes .
They wound up sweeping their exhibition slate , giving Parcells a remarkable 39 - 14 preseason record as a head coach with the Giants , Patriots and Jets .
And then the Jets produced their turnaround 9 - 7 regular-season record , narrowly missing the playoffs .
Now Parcells , instead of telling the players , as he did a year ago , that it was time to stop being the worst team in the league , talks to them about being one of the better teams .
And many players feel they can be .
Still , nobody knows exactly what kind of team these Jets will be , particularly since there will be at least 10 different starters from a year ago .
But Thursday night , fans may find out something about Foley , who has been elevated from sporadic starter to No. 1 quarterback , and whether the grit and swagger he has displayed in the past will continue now that he has the added pressure of defending his new status .
Foley may not have his newest support player available , since Curtis Martin suffered a hamstring injury that kept him from running for six days .
If he feels comfortable Thursday night , though , Parcells may use him .
But the Jets have an array of other new offensive players they are testing .
Wayne Chrebet is now a full-time starter at receiver with Keyshawn Johnson .
Dedric Ward , the meteoric rookie of last summer who quickly burned out and then came back , is attempting to be the club 's third pass catcher .
He is the team 's fastest player .
Foley can also count on sure-handed receivers out of the backfield .
In addition to Martin , there is Richie Anderson and Leon Johnson , as well as the new fullback tandem of Jerald Sowell and Keith Byars .
For now , there appears to be no clear-cut winner in the tight end race between Kyle Brady and Fred Baxter .
The major question remaining among the starters on offense is at right tackle _ can the rookie from Cincinnati , Jason Fabini , unseat Siupeli Malamala ?
It appears Parcells is leaning that way .
He is giving Fabini , a fourth-round pick , every chance in practice and has him rotating with the first unit .
And this much is certain about the revamped line : It is immeasurably stronger up the middle with Kevin Mawae at center .
Last year 's combination of Roger Duffy at the position , with the deliberate Neil O ' Donnell at quarterback , created a dangerous combination .
O ' Donnell was sacked once for every 10 passing attempts .
The Jets ' defense will have Dwayne Gordon at middle linebacker in place of Marvin Jones , whose season was ended by a training-camp knee injury last Friday .
But Bill Belichick , the assistant head coach and defensive mastermind , has confidence in a revised front four that includes the free-agent pickup Anthony Pleasant at right end .
Perhaps the Jets will test some new pass-rushing schemes against the Eagles .
If Pleasant can get to the quarterback , as he did for Belichick in their days in Cleveland , the Jets will not have to rush a linebacker quite so often .

Another issue for the front four is whether there will be continued improvement from left tackle Jason Ferguson , who was only a rookie last year .
This season 's top draft choice , defensive end Dorian Boose from Washington State , has only been mediocre in camp .
Now he will be scrutinized in a game , as will the team 's second pick , safety Scott Frost out of Nebraska , where he was the starting quarterback .
As for the Eagles , they are led by third-year quarterback Bobby Hoying , who does not have Ricky Watters at running back any longer .
Watters signed with Seattle .
The Jets will , however , face Hugh Douglas , who is now the Eagles ' left defensive end following his failure to adjust to the Jets ' 3 - 4 defense last year .

EXTRA POINTS
With the addition of Bryan Cox , the Jets now have seven players who have gone to the Pro Bowl .
But of all of them , only cornerback Aaron Glenn has made it as a Jet .
