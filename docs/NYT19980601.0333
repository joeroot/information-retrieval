ANI DEFRANCO MAKES SONGS SPEAK DIRECTLY
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By STEVE MORSE c.1998 The Boston Globe
The fiercely independent Ani DiFranco is a walking , talking , guitar-strutting rebel .
She 's proud of her `` indie girl '' status , her anti-corporate politics , her sexuality , her refusal to sell her music for TV ads , her saying no to the Lilith Fair and Lollapalooza festivals , and the creation of her own label , the Buffalo-based Righteous Babe Records .
Her female empowerment has made her a fascinating subject to the media , even though many analysts forget to mention the most important ingredient of her success _ her music .
`` The media rarely get to what I actually do , '' says DiFranco , whose raw , visceral style is best appreciated by the loyal fans who have followed her most of the last decade , but also by the many newcomers who have made her an amphitheater headliner this year for the first time .
`` The audience doesn n't come to the shows because I believe in independence or in trying to fight corporate forces in the music industry , '' says DiFranco from her Buffalo office .
`` I don n't think that would sustain them for very long .
They come out to hear the songs and I come out to play them .
And that 's really where it lives . ''
DiFranco , now 27 , has become a folk-punk sensation with an intensity unsurpassed in the acoustic world .
This summer , she headlines Great Woods and plays the Ben & AMP ; Jerry 's Newport Folk Festival .
And she 's done it with a rapier-sharp ability to write about relationships ( `` She 's the best right now ...
I haven n't heard poetry like that since Bob Dylan , '' says Bonnie Raitt ) , along with a physical , in-your-face guitar style that has been likened to karate chops .
She achieves it by wearing fake nails and taping her fingers together to get a dense , edgily percussive tone on the strings .
`` In the beginning , I had a much more folkie sound , '' DiFranco says .
`` I was emulating what I knew and what I heard around me .
And then , as I came into my own , it just got more and more aggresssive because that 's the environment I lived in .
I moved to New York and I played in bars for years .
And my playing technique was a way of surviving in the bar circuit .
And also , it 's just me .
I love my guitars , but I dole out a certain amount of abuse on them .
I 've always been interested in ways to rock hard without a lot of electricity , with just an acoustic guitar and not with an amplifier turned up to 11 . ''
DiFranco has become a phenomenon with an arena-size audience , despite never having had a hit single .
`` My career is not like the career of a pop star , '' says DiFranco .
`` I have no radio hits and I will never have a radio hit .
People have often commented on the intensity of the relationship between me and my audience , but they have to understand that it 's been built up over 10 years .
And people also notice that ( my fans ) know all the words to all the songs .
Again , there is no hit , and it 's not like I have one album and then I had the hit radio single and thousands and thousands of people are turning up , waiting to hear that familiar song .
It 's a much different kind of dynamic .
`` Because there are no hits , the audience has more of a relationship to me , than to a particular song , '' she adds .
`` And I 'm not really part of a scene .
I 'm just this bumbling folk singer that won n't give up , so there 's a long-term familiarity there ; a history , maybe . ''
This `` bumbling '' folk singer is really a workaholic whose talent is evident to anyone who has listened to her better-known CDs , such as `` Not a Pretty Face , '' `` Dilate , '' and her latest , `` Little Plastic Castle . ''
All stretch the boundaries of folk music .
The new album even plunges into ska rhythms , lounge-twang guitar , primal screams , spoken-word poetry , and folk-jazz to go along with her core folk-punk .
`` There 's a lot of work you have to do in order to get up and bumble effectively , '' DiFranco says with a laugh .
`` It 's clearly not as haphazard as it might appear .
But , yes , basically the songwriting has always been my focus .
It 's always been the basis of my music . ''
DiFranco is the daughter of two MIT graduates .
Her mother became an architect and her father an engineer .
DiFranco herself grew up loving the cerebral song craft of Joni Mitchell , but also the emotional punk music of bands like the Minutemen and Husker Du .
To emphasize her punky side , she also used to shave her head and wear thick work boots .
`` There 's a kind of DIY ( Do It Yourself ) ethic that I 've always had , '' says DiFranco .
`` And I think that , at its essence , folk music and punk music share a lot in that they 're community-based , subcorporate musical forms , traditionally , anyway .
Of course they can be commercialized and co-opted and found in all sorts of different contexts , but basically they give voice to what 's going on at a street level in the country . ''
What separates DiFranco from the pack is the all-out energy she brings to the stage .
It was apparent when she opened last summer for Bob Dylan _ and the show at Great Woods ( her first tour with a band ) was so impressive that one newspaper headline read `` Ani DiFranco leaves Bob Dylan blowing in the wind . ''
`` I 've never had a lot of interest in doing things halfway , '' she says of her fiery stage persona .
`` I think , ` If all these people are going to bother to drag their butts out to the show , and if I 'm going to bother to subject myself to mass criticism , then I may as well put out .
I may as well expend every ounce of energy .
Otherwise , why did we all assemble ? ' I think that for me , if I have any ounce of energy left after a show , then I wonder , what was I saving it for , if not for my work ? ''
In her younger years , DiFranco was influenced by such folkies as Suzanne Vega , Tom Paxton , Rod McDonald , Cliff Eberhart , Cheryl Wheeler , and old-timer Utah Phillips .
She went on to produce Phillips 's last album and will do his next as well .
`` He 's one of my heroes , '' she says .
DiFranco 's rise to fame has been rapid in recent years .
And her big concern these days is how comfortable she 'll be in the oversize summer sheds .
`` The venues are just getting bigger and bigger as my audience gets bigger , '' says DiFranco .
`` But it 's inherently less rewarding for me to play in these larger venues , because I get off so much on the intense energy of the more intimate dynamic .
`` Maybe we should just drop out and start touring under a pseudonym in little clubs , '' she adds with a laugh .
`` I 'm actually one of those crazy people who 's pretty content touring at a smaller level .
But we 're going to give the sheds a try this summer and make it as real as we can . ''
By `` making it real , '' she means : Don n't look for the smoke and lights of many typical shed shows .
`` I 've never been into the pomp and circumstance of the rock ' n ' roll show .
Basically , at heart , I 'm a folk singer .
It 's pretty simple stuff .
I get up onstage and I play music and I try to talk to people and get a semblance of a dialogue going .
I don n't want to put on a big flashy show .
That 's not me . ''
Nor did she want to join Lilith Fair or Lollapalooza and have to shorten her sets to fit in .
`` I was much more inspired by the idea of going out and playing my own shows .
If you play for 25 minutes ( at a festival ) , you can only go so deep with it .
But when you play for an hour and a half or two hours , you really get inside the music .
It can be much more profound . ''
