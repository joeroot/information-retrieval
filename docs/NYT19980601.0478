SILVER GOES SOUTH ON WARREN BUFFETT
( ja ) By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ One of the most heralded investment bets of the last year _ Warren Buffett 's purchase of almost 130 million ounces of silver _ now appears to be a money loser .
The price of silver in the last week has dropped close to $ 5 an ounce , bringing it significantly below the average price of Buffett 's silver purchases .
By one calculation , he now has a paper loss of at least $ 14.1 million , a 2.1 percent decline in the value of his entire silver investment .
In the 1997 annual report for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , his investment vehicle , he said he had a profit of $ 97.4 million on his silver investment as of the end of last year .
For Buffett , these losses are no more significant in his portfolio than his bridge losses .
But they have been far more painful for the investors who like to follow Buffett wherever he goes .
When he announced his silver investment after the close of the markets on Feb. 3 , the price of silver on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange had already soared to $ 6.615 an ounce , 53 percent higher than it was on July 25 , when Buffett began accumulating the metal .
The price quickly shot as high as $ 7.40 an ounce in intraday trading on Feb. 5.
Then the hangover began to set in .
By Feb. 17 , the closing price of silver had fallen below $ 7 an ounce ; it then bounced around between $ 6.50 an ounce and $ 6 an ounce until the beginning of May .
Since then the price has gone only south , closing Monday at $ 5.055 an ounce , down 3 cents .
On Friday and Monday , the price fell below $ 5 an ounce in intraday trading .
An investor who bought a 5,000-ounce silver contract at the lowest intraday price on Feb. 4 , the day after the Buffett announcement , paid $ 33 , 550 .
At Monday 's closing price , that contract was worth $ 25 , 275 , a drop of 24.7 percent .
`` The people who have gone along with him are feeling reasonably bruised by the experience , '' said Dinsa Mehta , the managing director for global commodities at Chase Manhattan Bank .
`` They don n't have his staying power , and they don n't have his portfolio diversity . ''
It is not clear if Buffett has actually lost any money .
The calculations of the current value of his investment do not assume he has sold any silver or lent any of it out to traders or others who needed silver .
There have been rumors that he sold silver , but he has refused to comment on that .
He did say at his company 's annual meeting in the beginning of May that he had lent silver , which would bring in a little income .
He said that it was only a ` small '' amount but gave no figures .

These calculations also do not include Buffett 's cost of storage for the silver he bought .
The current value of the Buffett holdings are based on the Berkshire Hathaway annual report for 1997 .
At the time he announced the silver purchase , Buffett said its total value amounted to less than 2 percent of Berkshire Hathaway 's investment portfolio .
He bought control of 111.2 million ounces of silver in 1997 .
The value at the end of the year was $ 665.87 million based on the Dec. 31 closing price .
Subtracting a profit of $ 97.4 million , leaves $ 568.47 million as the cost of his investment , or an average of $ 5.112 an ounce .
At Monday 's closing price of $ 5.055 an ounce , the loss is $ 6.35 million .
The price of the 18.5 million ounces of silver he bought by Jan. 12 , 1998 , is not known .
But Buffett has said his last purchase was on Jan. 12 , when the price was $ 5.475 , the lowest price of the year .
Assuming he bought all 18.5 million ounces at this price , his loss on this silver is now $ 7.77 million .
If he bought some of the 18.5 million ounces earlier in 1998 , his loss would be larger .
At the average price from Jan. 2 to Jan. 12 , his loss is $ 14.43 million .
This means his paper loss ranges from $ 14.1 million to $ 28.5 million .
More heartening for investors who are facing losses at the moment , Buffett seemed to reaffirm his confidence in the outlook for silver at the annual meeting , as he repeated his reason for buying it : `` We thought that the figures on production and demand were such that it would require a higher price to establish equilibrium . ''
But Buffett is not the type to tip off what he is doing in advance .
