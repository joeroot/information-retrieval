Iraq to Reiterate Unconditional Cooperation with U.N.
UNITED NATIONS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraq would reiterate late Saturday night that its decision to resume full and complete cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors was unconditional , a U.N. diplomat said .
The diplomat said Iraq was ready to make the point in written form to the United Nations Security Council on Saturday night , clarifying that its decision to resume full cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) was unconditional .
Iraq would state in a letter that the annex to the letter that Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz sent to U.N. chief Kofi Annan on Saturday morning was a " wish list " , not a list of conditions for Iraq to resume cooperation with the U.N. , the diplomat said .
The nine-point annex deals mainly with a proposal for a comprehensive review by the Security Council of how far Iraq has progressed in carrying out U.N. disarmament requirements , which Iraq says should lead to the lifting of sanctions against it .
The annex also says that the Council should seriously consider " the question of Richard Butler and the structure of UNSCOM , " referring to the UNSCOM chief whom Baghdad wants fired .
The United States said on Saturday that Iraq 's promise to resume full cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors was unacceptable because it was conditional .
Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. chief on Saturday morning that it had decided to rescind its decisions of August 5 and October 31 and to resume full cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors .
