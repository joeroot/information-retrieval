The debate at the forum was part of the worldwide discussion on how best to deal with the current economic situation , in which stagnating markets go hand-in-hand with financial volatility , said the English newspaper .
The need for greater innovation is regarded as especially urgent in China , where industrial output generated by high-tech products accounts for less than 10 percent of the country 's total , said the paper .
It noted that science and technology now only contribute to around 30 percent of China 's economic growth , while their share in developed countries is usually between 60 and 70 percent .
And only about 10 percent of scientific research findings in China find their way into production .
According to the newspaper , AlliedSignal , a New Jersey-based high-tech manufacturing company in the aerospace , automotive and chemicals sectors , is playing an active role in financing high-tech projects and training local personnel .
