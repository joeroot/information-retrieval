PARCELLS ' COACHING STRATEGY : AVOID LOSING
( bl ) By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
If anyone wants to understand at least one aspect of what coach Bill Parcells is all about , then know this : He is not so much preparing his New York Jets to win in the playoffs as he is preparing them not to lose .
For that is at the heart of Parcells ' philosophy .
Before you understand how to win , he believes , you must understand what it is that causes you to lose .
This fear of losing also manifests itself in his compulsion to nurture his superstitions .
At first it seems odd that this high-energy successful coach would look at the negative side of the ledger .
But when he was asked earlier this week what the Jets needed to do to win their next two games to get to the Super Bowl , his answer was simple .
`` I go back to this : How are you going to lose ? ''
Parcells said .
So when the Jets return to work Thursday after having three days off and begin preparing for their Jan. 10 divisional playoff game , they will hear Parcells talk about penalties and turnovers .
They will walk past a sign that reads : `` Smart players make smart plays .
Dumb players make dumb plays . ''
From the moment Parcells tried to make the Jets into something other than the old Jets , it was with that credo in mind .
This season has not simply been about quarterback Vinny Testaverde 's 29 touchdown passes .
It is as much about his mere seven interceptions .
It is not solely about the yardage gained , but about the yardage not lost .
Thus , the Jets committed only 85 penalties , third-fewest in the league , totaling 651 yards .
But the Jets ' opponents had 967 yards in penalties .
Parcells has figured over the years that every 100 yards you gain over an opponent , no matter where it comes from , translates to 7 points .
Parcells hates sacks .
He growled every time Neil O ' Donnell was sacked last year _ once every 10 throws .
Sacks slow you down , take you out of field-goal range if you are deep in the opponents ' territory and cost you a play .
This year the Jets were fourth-best in the league in preventing the sack .
Testaverde was dumped only once every 22 throws .
He was sacked only twice in the final six games , all Jets victories .
Parcells warns his special teams players that if they have to make a decision on whether to follow through on a play that could lead to a penalty , do not do it .
Decide to do nothing .
The Jets ' special teams committed only one penalty in the last six games .
During that stretch the opposition committed 16 .
Parcells also preaches the importance of turnovers .
Unlike some coaches who merely talk about this being significant , Parcells fires players who bobble the ball .
The Jets went from minus-4 after five games to plus-6 in winning 10 of their last 11 games .
But to understand Parcells more fully , this fear and loathing of losing almost translates to obsessions .
His superstitions are part of his fear of losing .
He has his lucky elephants with the upturned trunks .
He has his special coins .
Often , Parcells talks about the great motivating force in life : fear of failure .
He is proud that he got this from his father .
He cites his former coaches who goaded him this way .
He does not keep the lucky charms around to bring him victories ; he keeps them to avoid bad luck .
Thus , while coaching the Patriots during their 1996 playoff run , Parcells even carried a Chai , the Hebrew symbol denoting life , which is considered a good-luck charm .
When the Jets had gone eight straight games earlier this season without losing a regular player to injury _ and the club was the only one in the league that week not to have one player listed as hurt _ a reporter asked to speak to the medical and training staff .
`` No , '' said Parcells , who is the only person in the organization who can give coaches or any other football people permission to speak to the news media .
Later , one of his confidants explained that Parcells did not want to tempt fate by having someone write about his team 's good health .
The story was written anyway , but with no comments from the medical staff .
Was Parcells prescient ?
The next game , Aaron Glenn and Keith Byars sustained injuries that would keep them out of the final three games .
They will return for the playoffs , though .
But guess what Parcells believes their injuries were due to .
Earlier this season Parcells visited the dentist .
The Jets won the next game .
Two days later Parcells showed up in the dentist 's office .
Why ?
He wanted to sit in his good-luck chair .
He had his teeth cleaned .
Just the other day , a reporter asked him to make his coaches available for interviews .
They have done a remarkable job on the club .
Most have been with him for many years .
They include Bill Belichick , who should be the object of attention by the half-dozen clubs looking for a head coach but who is the Jets ' head coach-in-waiting .
Belichick is the defensive coordinator .
In that role , he has presided over a defense that came within a single point of allowing the fewest points of any team _ and just two seasons after the Jets had given up a league-worst 454 points .
And there is widespread interest in Charlie Weis , the offensive coordinator , who calls most of the plays for a team averaging 26 points a game .
Perhaps people want to read about Mike Sweatman , who inherited the worst special teams in the league in 1997 and has coached them to become one of the most dangerous kickoff and returns units .
`` Nah , '' said Parcells , when queried about interviewing them .
`` You can get them at the Super Bowl .
I have to . ''
During Super Bowl week , all coaches meet with the news media .
League rules require they do so .
But why not now ?
Parcells was asked .
`` It 's bad luck , '' he said .
He was not smiling .
