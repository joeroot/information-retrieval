& HT ; ( -- -- - Please call or fax for a price quote . ) & HT ; By EVERETT DeMORIER ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) From `` Crib Notes for the First Year of Marriage '' & HT ; Whether you 've been living together since junior high school or spent your first night together on your honeymoon , the agenda for the first year of marriage is pretty much the same .
Just when you thought you knew your spouse better than your spouse knew himself or herself , you 're really meeting each other for the first time .
& HT ; Many young couples tend to see married life as an extension of single life , with an additional person .
But as soon as two people step across the marriage threshold , with sweater-drying rack and dartboard in hand , two sets of histories and expectations must join .
& HT ; Studies of marriage show there is no correlation between an easy first year of marriage and living together prior to being married , but living together does get a few of those put-the-old-milk-carton-in-front-of-the-new-one-so-we-use-the - old-one-first type of rules out of the way .
Some of them , but not all .
& HT ; Below are some of the most common issues in the first year of marriage , and some suggestions for how couples can deal with them .
& HT ; + Feeling at home .
& HT ; Having a housewarming or a dinner party is a great way to make a new home your own , whether you have moved in with your spouse or the two of you have moved into a new home together .
Having friends and family there to see you in your new surroundings can create a sense of pride in your home , and a feeling of ease and comfort .
& HT ; Sometimes it 's the little things that help establish roots , such as being the voice on the answering machine , planting a garden or making friends with the neighbors .
& HT ; + The slob factor .
& HT ; If your spouse 's housekeeping skills leave a bit to be desired , if clothes and dishes pave a path from the couch to the refrigerator , the pile method is a great alternative to bashing your spouse with a tire iron .
& HT ; The pile method simply involves picking a neutral location _ a desk , a dresser , a closet , somewhere you can live with a mess _ and placing all the wallets , car keys , dirty socks , magazines , dishes and so forth in that place .
& HT ; This works for the `` neatnik , '' because everything can be picked up and deposited quickly , and it works for the slob because everything is in one place .
Note : This is a treatment , not a cure .
& HT ; + The clash of expectations .
& HT ; Sit down and discuss in detail how you expect your life as a couple to be .
Maybe your mental picture is unrealistic .
You won n't know until it 's out in the open .
Be specific .
& HT ; Do you expect coffee to be brought to you in the morning like your father did for your mother ?
Do you expect your mate to be home exactly at 5 o ' clock ?
Do you expect to be able to have friends over every night ?
& HT ; The majority of newlyweds ' fights occur when one spouse is not acting the way the other spouse expects .
But no one , not even Robert Duvall , can act without a script .
& HT ; + The age-old toothpaste dilemma .
& HT ; This type of conflict is quite normal and really simple to resolve when you get right down to it .
If your mate insists on leaving the cap off the toothpaste , or worse , squeezing the tube in the middle ( gasp ! ) , just buy two tubes of toothpaste .
& HT ; To solve the problem of whether to roll the toilet paper over or under _ believe it or not , this actually accounted for an entire segment on Oprah _ try installing two rollers .
& HT ; Of course , having separate bathrooms would solve not only both these problems but also that perennial problem in the battle of the sexes : Should the toilet seat be left up or down ?
& HT ; The best advice is just to get over it .
Sure , you think the world would be a lot better place if your mate would just ...
But would it really ?
& HT ; Personal habits take some getting used to .
Any two people need time to adjust to each other , a new lifestyle and new surroundings .
Relax .
A routine will develop soon enough , and you will quickly forget that you were ever uncomfortable .
& HT ; + `` Don n't talk to me before I have my coffee . ''
& HT ; There are morning people and there are night people .
And then there are peppy morning people .
If you 've married one of those people who pop out of bed , draw open the shades and sing in the shower ...
first of all , my condolences .
On the other hand , your mate is probably a happy person , which may be why you fell in love with him or her in the first place .
& HT ; + `` Isn n't the game over yet ? ''
& HT ; Husbands watching sports all weekend is one of the most frequent complaints heard from newlywed women .
While women often complain about their husband 's sports-viewing habits , however , many women actually like watching sports on television , particularly with their mates .
Where couples run into trouble is when watching sports occupies the entire weekend .
& HT ; One possible solution is planning specific games and sports to watch , rather than just watching anything that 's on .
& HT ; Here are some other solutions : & HT ; Have a sports party .
Invite friends or other couples over to watch the game .
& HT ; Participate in a sport together .
Join a volleyball team or a bowling league .
Take up tennis or golf .
Being involved in a sport makes it more interesting to watch it on television .
& HT ; Go to the sporting event together .
Rather than lounge in the easy chair all day Saturday , buy tickets to the local college football game and make a day of it .
& HT ; Go do something else on your weekend time together , and listen to the game on the way .
& HT ; + Sharing the covers .
& HT ; There 's not much people can do to change their behaviors when they 're fast asleep .
Thus , newlyweds often complain about the spouse 's snoring , hogging the covers or kicking them in the middle of the night .
& HT ; There are some things both partners can do before falling asleep , however , that can reduce the occurrence of cover stealing .
For instance , if the partner who steals the blankets dresses more warmly for bed , he or she may not be as likely to feel cold during the night .
Likewise , if the partner who ends up without covers during the night dresses more warmly , he or she will not mind as much when the covers disappear .
& HT ; Another solution would be to keep an emergency blanket next to the bed so that whoever finds himself or herself without covers during the night can use a substitute blanket .
& HT ; For a more romantic option , try sleeping closer together .
Body heat is better than a blanket any day .
