Kenyan Govt Reviews Tea Act
NAIROBI , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- The Kenyan government is reviewing its Tea Act to make it responsive to the changing demands of the industry .
" The intention of the review is to remove unnecessary controls and to enhance the regulatory role of the Tea Board of Kenya ( KTDA ) in a liberalized tea industry , " said Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi , as quoted by the Nation newspaper Sunday .
The minister said the review has been accelerated because tea is currently the country 's largest foreign exchange earner with an annual turnover of 54 billion Shillings ( some 900 million U.S. Dollars ) .
In the first seven months , the country earned 362 million Dollars with tea export .
It is predicted a bumper tea harvest this year due to the positive effects from the El Nino induced rains , the minister said , adding that the 1998 production is likely to reach a record peak of 280 tons .
The Kenyan government has increased investment in infrastructure , especially roads , in tea-growing areas in order to revamp the industry .
Mudavadi said the government is taking structural reform measures , including the removal of price control for tea sold in the local market , creation of room for competition in tea-packing and distribution , and the restructuring of the KTDA .
