ROME _ The resignation of President Suharto under intense pressure from popular demonstrations and finally from the military , which holds the keys of power , is a great step forward for Indonesia .
Although it was against his will , Suharto 's peaceful departure from power nonetheless crowned decades of great accomplishment .
Although gravely marred by the last 15 years or so of rampant corruption , forcible suppression of opposition and brutal , imperialistic expansion in East Timor , the overall record of Suharto 's administration is , nonetheless , admirable .
He and his American-educated technocrats transformed a nation that was literally bankrupt , with people on the verge of mass starvation .
When Suharto stepped down , the people of Indonesia 's 13,000-odd islands were generally well off and better educated ; they spoke the national language , as well as their own , widely divergent tongues ; they no longer groaned under the oppression of the Javanese , the domineering natives of the largest island , and they truly felt themselves citizens of a nation whose motto is `` unity out of diversity . ''
For the first time the voice of the people has been decisive .
No transfer of power in the former East Indies ' thousands of years of history as an empire or as a congeries of principalities had ever before been determined by the public 's wishes .
Certainly no transfer of power in Indonesia 's 50 years as a nominal republic had occurred peacefully .
Wits used to say that Indonesia was the most stable nation in Asia , perhaps the entire world _ after all , it had had only two presidents in half a century , Sukarno and Suharto .
That jape was inspired by the constant upheavals , the unceasing strife and the suffering that tormented Indonesia under the grandiose Sukarno .
To truly appreciate Suharto it is necessary to have seen the catastrophic effects of Sukarno 's government and the extraordinary circumstances under which Suharto came to power in 1966 .
Sukarno was the most glamorous , if not necessarily the most effective , leader of the revolution that overthrew Dutch rule .
He was also the most flamboyant , parading his sexual exploits .
The Indonesian people were at first delighted by the great man as irresistible demagogue and , alternately , as lovable scamp .
They greatly enjoyed his antics , although the two or three complaisant young women provided by local governments every night of his state visits usually left the next morning unsullied .
By the mid-1960s Sukarno 's disregard for almost everything except his own glory had produced acute material distress in Indonesia , which had endured several abortive revolts against him , one sponsored by the CIA .
He was not only a stalking horse for the Communists , but a wastrel who scattered the national wealth like confetti .
In late 1965 , Sukarno joined the Communist Party and the air force in what looked like a coup against himself .
He was actually seeking to regain the power the anti-Communist army had taken away from him .
The coup opened with an assassination plot against the ranking army generals .
Aside from the chief of staff , who did not want supreme power , Suharto was the only important general to survive .
He had clambered over his garden wall , just escaping the assassins .
The most junior general the night of the murders , he assumed power as the most senior still living .
Although Suharto was party to the army 's vengeful and merciless extermination of several hundred thousand presumed leftists , his normal style was wholly different from Sukarno 's .
His unpretentious jeep even stopped at red lights .
Sukarno built a tall white pillar topped by a golden flame , formally the National Monument but universally known as Sukarno 's last erection .
Suharto 's monuments are broad boulevards lined by office buildings and hotels .
& QL ;
Assisted by overseas Chinese strategists and financiers , Suharto 's technocrats , the Berkeley mafia , built a largely laissez-faire economy that spread benefits throughout the islands .
Jakarta , the capital , benefited most .
When I first saw the city in the mid-1950s there were no hotels , no taxis , no dialing telephones , no supermarkets and few automobiles , restaurants or stores .
All those appurtenances of modernity , as well as air conditioning , now exist in abundance .
Alienated by power and sycophants from reality and responsibility , Suharto subsequently fostered corruption and looting of wealth all but unparalleled in Asia or elsewhere .
Nonetheless , he has left Indonesia with the physical and the psychological basis for much greater modern growth .
