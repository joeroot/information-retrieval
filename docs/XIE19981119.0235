Bangladesh Gets 1.23 Million Tons of Pledged Food Aid
DHAKA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Bangladesh has so far received food aid pledges of more than 1.23 million tons from foreign countries after its flood earlier this year , a daily newspaper reported Thursday .
Answering a question in the parliament Wednesday , Food and Agriculture Minister Motia Chowdhury said that of the total , 726,400 tons would be received as flood aid while the rest 508,117 tons would be regular aid , The New Nation said .
During the catastrophic flood period , no foodgrain was damaged by flood water at any government godown , she added .
The government had a food reserve of more than 733,000 tons in its hand on November 5 , she told the house , apparently denying a rumor that a possible famine would occur in the country .
Bangladesh experienced the most severe floods in a century this year , which lasted for 10 weeks and hit two-thirds of the country with more than 30 million people seriously affected .
The agricultural sector was heavily hit , with 850,000 hectares of cropland ruined and an estimated 3.5 million tons of grains lost .
Therefore , the Bangladeshi government appealed in August this year to donor countries and international agencies for food aid .
Besides , both government and private sectors have taken measures to import 1.5 million tons of grains respectively to meet the food shortage .
