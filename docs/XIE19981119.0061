40,000 Gallons Crude Oil Flows Into River in Kansas
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- More than 40,000 gallons of crude oil has flowed into a river in Kansas because of an oil pipeline leak in Kansas , polluting at least 20 kilometers downstream into Oklahoma .
Crews were working to contain the leak Wednesday , which was detected Tuesday night after the Montgomery County Sheriff 's Office received calls of a petroleum smell , an Associated Press report said .
Farmland Refinery , which owned the line , blocked off the line to stop the leak about a half-hour after it was found .
The leak happened in a section of 12-inch pipe that runs about three miles between a crude oil tank and the refinery .
Farmland officials say they don n't know what caused the leak into the Verdigris River , or how long it had been going on .
