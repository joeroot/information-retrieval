Genocide Criminal in Rwanda Sentenced to Life
NAIROBI , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The specialized chamber of the Court of First Instance of southern Butare Prefecture has sentenced to life imprisonment another man on genocide charges .
Tharcisse Karuranga was pursued for genocide crimes and complicity in the perpetration of the genocide that devastated his home commune Mbazi in Butare in 1994 .
" The verdict fell after the hearings were postponed seven times as the court was trying to get the accounts of witnesses to the atrocities in which the accused was involved , " a special report by Rwanda News Agency reaching here said .
During his trial , Karuranga -- a former driver and mechanic -- was assisted by a lawyer hired by " Avocats Sans Frontiers ( lawyers without borders ) , " a Belgian non-governmental organization .
Karuranga had defended himself by claiming that he was badly sick during the massacres in his home commune , rejecting all charges .
During the massacres at Mbazi , he allegedly killed Tutsis who had fled to his house and was seen driving others to the local Mutunda soccer stadium to be killed .
The number of people killed at Mbazi have been estimated by some human rights organizations at between 5,000 and 7,000 people .
The Butare court found Karuranga guilty of all charges and sentenced him to life in prison .
Both Karuranga and his lawyer maintain that he is innocent .
Genocide trials in Rwandan courts started in late 1996 in the eastern town of Kibungo .
According to statistics by the Ministry of Justice , by December 1997 , 304 genocide suspects had been tried , with 108 death penalties , and 103 life sentences .
Over 100,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in Rwandan prisons waiting for trials .
