Libya Allowed to Play in African Nations Cup
LOME , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Libya will be allowed to play in the qualifying tournament for the African Nations Cup finals in Zimbabwe in 2000 despite United Nations sanctions against the north African country .
The Libyans were included in the preliminary round of the qualifying matches for the next African championship , released by the Confederation of African Football ( CAF ) on Thursday .
They had been suspended in accordance with sanctions imposed on the country following the Lockerbie air disaster in 1988 .
Nigeria , suspended from the 1998 qualifiers after they withdrew from the finals in South Africa two years ago in a diplomatic spat between the two countries , was also included .
A record 45 countries will compete for 14 places in the tournament in Zimbabwe , including newcomers Djibouti , Eritrea and the tiny island nation of Sao Tome e Principe .
