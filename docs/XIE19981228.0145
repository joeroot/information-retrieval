Hunan Province to Redouble Levee Reinforcement Projects
CHANGSHA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Central China 's Hunan Province , which suffered from the worst damage during heavy summer flooding , will allocate five billion yuan and redouble efforts to reinforce water conservation projects over the winter .
The province learned a painful lesson during summer flooding when the vulnerability of some levees and water channels was readily apparent due to the shrinking containment capacities of rivers and lakes .
The province has banned land reclamation from the Dongting Lake which has shrunk due to encroaching farmland .
The move , which will involve the relocation of some nearly 200,000 people , will increase the water surface of Dongting Lake by 1,900 sq.km .
and the storage capacity by 10 billion cubic meters .
In addition , the province will complete afforestation projects on 6,600 ha .
by the end of the next year in an effort to significantly reduce soil erosion .
