NEW RULES COULD STALL CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By BOB HOHLER c.1998 The Boston Globe
WASHINGTON _ For four years , House members backing an overhaul of the nation 's campaign finance system struggled to build a majority to pass the measure .
Last week , they said they had reached their goal , securing the 218 votes needed for a simple majority in the 435-member House .
But now House Republican leaders have changed the rules , demonstrating that nothing is likely to be simple in the campaign to get big money out of politics .
Faced with newly crafted House procedures for considering the campaign finance issue _ rules the House parliamentarian described as `` unheard of '' in recent history _ advocates for overhauling the system began waging a grass-roots effort last week to persuade dozens of additional House members to form a super majority they may need to overcome the obstacle .
The rules , which have sent confused lawmakers scurrying to House parliamentarian Charles Johnson for guidance , effectively create a legislative free-for-all among every coalition trying to improve the campaign finance system .
Debate on the issue , which began May 21 , is set to resume this week , after House members return from their weeklong Memorial Day recess , & UR ; & LR ; and continue into the summer .
`` The Republican leaders have set up a system to divide and conquer , '' said Lloyd Leonard , spokesman for the League of Women Voters , which favors major changes in the system .
`` We need to unite all our forces against them . ''
If the standard House rules applied , supporters of a bill sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays , a Connecticut Republican , and Martin T. Meehan , a Lowell Democrat , said they would have enough votes to pass the overhaul measure and send it to the Senate .
The Shays-Meehan plan is nearly identical to a bill that won majority support in the Senate last year but died when backers could not muster the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster .
Supporters hope that passing the House bill will provide new momentum in the Senate .
But under the process devised recently by the House Rules Committee , 12 campaign finance proposals , will be voted on , and the bill that receives the most votes will prevail .
As a consequence , for example , 300 House members could vote for the Shays-Meehan plan , but if 301 members voted for a rival proposal to create a commission to study the issue for a year , the Shays-Meehan measure would die .
`` These are nothing more than a new set of procedural tricks to kill reform , '' said Don Simon , executive vice president of Common Cause .
The group joined the League of Women Voters and several other organizations in the effort to garner support for the Shays-Meehan plan .
House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who pledged in a meeting three years ago with President Clinton to change the campaign finance system , helped create the special rules .
His leadership team has defended the procedure .
`` This is a very fair , open rule , '' said Representative John Linder , a Georgia Republican who serves on the Rules Committee and is chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
`` The opponents of this open debate want us to close down the process , allow consideration of only one bill , and foreclose all other opinions . ''
Gingrich , Linder , and the rest of the GOP leadership team are cosponsoring a stark alternative to the Shays-Meehan bill .
Their plan would abolish all campaign contribution limits , but require candidates to make quicker and fuller disclosure of their donations .
Meehan described the special rules and the Gingrich-backed bill as the latest of numerous moves that Republican leaders have made to stymie efforts by his coalition .
`` The speaker is totally opposed to passing campaign finance reform legislation , and he 's doing everything possible to thwart the will of the majority , '' Meehan said .
The Shays-Meehan measure would ban large , unregulated donations known as `` soft money '' that have increasingly influenced state and national elections .
The bill also would tighten disclosure requirements and regulate spending by corporations , unions , and nonprofit groups on advertising that influences federal elections .
But with a simple majority no longer enough to guarantee their bill 's passing the House , Shays , Meehan , and their supporters are scurrying to win over additional House members and to persuade all their backers to vote against every other proposal but theirs .
The rival proposals include :
_ A `` Clean Money , Clean Election '' bill sponsored by Representative John Tierney , a Salem Democrat , that would allow candidates to choose either private financing or public funding with conditions .
_ A bipartisan measure sponsored by House freshmen that would ban most `` soft money '' and take less-aggressive steps than Shays-Meehan in overhauling other areas of the campaign finance system .
_ A bill sponsored by Representative Charles Bass , a New Hampshire Republican , that is identical to Shays-Meehan except that it includes a `` paycheck protection '' provision dealing with how unions use members ' dues for political spending .
Many House members have already agreed to vote for Shays-Meehan and against the other plans .
Even some members with competing proposals have indicated that they may withdraw their bills to help the cause .
Tierney , for example , `` is definitely going to vote for Shays-Meehan and be a strong supporter , '' said David Williams , his chief of staff .
Williams said Tierney might also withdraw his bill , which would remove any risk of its displacing the Shays-Meehan plan .
`` Part of the Republican strategy is to drag this out through the summer so people grow weary and tune out , '' Williams said .
`` We may just pull the thing . ''
Meanwhile , Bass , who has been a prime target of the grass-roots campaign because he led an effort in the New Hampshire Legislature to overhaul the state 's campaign finance system , has yet to decide how vigorously he will push his alternative .
`` Preparing for this debate is kind of like playing three-dimensional chess , '' said David Leland , his chief of staff .
But Leland said Bass has told Common Cause officials that they should take heart from his voting record .
`` He has voted for campaign reform every time it has come up in Congress , even if it hasn n't been the perfect bill , '' Leland said .
`` If the legislation is at least a step in the right direction , he will vote for it . ''
Still , Shays and Meehan , who were among many lawmakers seeking guidance from the House parliamentarian on the rules process , fear that their bill could be defeated by a rival plan or gutted by amendments .
They are trying to hold a fragile coalition of about 190 Democrats and 30 Republicans .
`` I concede we 're facing our toughest challenge yet , '' Meehan said .
`` But I 'm confident support for our bill is stronger than ever . ''
