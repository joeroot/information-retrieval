ECOMOG Evaluation Team Sent to Guinea Bissau
LAGOS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- A high-level team of the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG has left Nigerian capital Abuja for Guinea Bissau to evaluate the logistic requirements for deploying interposition force in that country .
The evaluation is to be carried out under an agreement signed in Abuja on November 1 by Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader Ansumane Mane , said Information Director of the Economic Community of West Africa states ( ECOWAS ) , Adrianne Diop .
Diop said that the team led by ECOMOG commander Timothy Skelpidi will determine the size of the peacekeeping force , equipment and communication facilities to enable the troops to perform their role of providing security along the country 's border with Senegal , the Nigeria News Agency Saturday quoted Diop as reporting .
Diop disclosed that Gambia has indicated its interest in contributing to the interposition force , adding that Senegal and Guinea are excluded from contributing to the force in accordance with the peace agreement .
Under the agreement , a government of national unity will be formed soon in Guinea Bissau and presidential elections will be held not later than March 1999 .
The agreement provides for the deployment of ECOMOG troops in Guinea Bissau to take over from Guinean and Senegalese troops who have been in that country at the invitation of President Vieira since the June 7 rebellion by sacked Army Chief of Staff Brigadier General Mane .
