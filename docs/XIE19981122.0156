Davenport Meets Hingis in Chase Championship Final
WASHINGTON , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Already assured of finishing the year as the No. 1 player in the world , Lindsay Davenport of the United States is one win away from closing the year in style .
Davenport , the top seed , advanced to the final of the s eason-ending 2 million US dollars Chase Championships today with a gutty three-set win over former No.1 Steffi Graf of Germany .
The 22-year-old overcame a nasty blister on her left foot and rallied from trouble in the third set to beat the five-time cha mpion 6 - 1 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 3.
Davenport 's opponent in Sunday 's best-of-five set final will be Martina Hingis of Switzerland -- the woman she replaced at No. 1.
Hingis set up a rematch of this year 's U.S. Open final by beating Romanian Irina Spirlea 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) in today 's other semifinal .
" It will be really fun , one versus two , " Davenport said .
" Even though I will be No.1 , it will be an interesting match .
We have played a lot this year . "
The two have met four times this year , with Davenport winning three of those matches .
She topped Hingis to win her first Grand Slam singles title just over two months ago at the U.S. Open in New York .
The all-time series stands tied at 6 - 6.
Davenport 's victory snapped Graf 's 12-match winning streak , a run compiled over the past three weeks , and ended Graf 's 10-match winning streak at the Chase Championships .
It also avenged a loss to Graf in the final of last week 's Avanta Championships .
" Last week , she played unbelievable , " Davenport said of Graf .
" I think she made a few more mistakes today . "
" Sure , I am disappointed right now , " Graf said after the match . " I knew I was really close and I don n't know what happened . "
" I gave it everything I had the last three weeks and that was a lot , " said Graf , who today became the only WTA Tour player to play four straight three-set mathces in 1998 .
Hingis improved her record to 6 - 0 against Spirlea and staged an impressive comeback in the second set to keep from losing a set for the first time against the tall Romanian .
" It was just a good comeback , " said Hingis , who will be appearing in the final for the second time in three years .
