CRITICISM FROM PEERS PUTS FOLEY ON DEFENSIVE

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ Reacting with annoyance Tuesday , Glenn Foley said he was surprised that Neil O ' Donnell appeared to denigrate Foley 's ability .
O ' Donnell , who is battling another former Jet , Jeff Blake , for the Cincinnati Bengals ' starting job , spoke recently about the Jets ' training camp last season .
`` I didn n't think there was a better quarterback in camp than me , '' O ' Donnell said .
`` I thought I proved that . ''
Describing Foley 's role this season as a starter rather than a backup , O ' Donnell said : `` It 's totally different when you are taking the snaps every day .
What do they say , ` The best job in America is backup quarterback , right ? '' '
Foley is sensitive about the twists and turns his career has taken .
He has had to battle three quarterbacks who were considered better than he was to reach his current status : starter for Thursday night 's preseason opener against the Philadelphia Eagles .
`` I 've never been able to shake that underdog label , '' Foley said .
`` It 's been tough gaining respect . ''
Four years ago , Blake put down Foley 's talent after he lost a battle with him .
Tuesday , Foley ruefully recalled Blake and O ' Donnell , his former opponents for the quarterback 's job on the team .
`` You have two guys , once they were beaten , left with negative comments , '' he said .
Foley remembered Blake 's controversial comments that hinted at racism as playing a role back in 1994 , when the rookie Foley was only a seventh-round selection and the Jets ' final draft pick .
Blake was a sixth-round choice two years earlier .
When Blake was cut , he spoke of Foley 's `` blue eyes . ''
And then , of course , there was O ' Donnell , who led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a Super Bowl and then became a Jet two years ago .
But he was benched for Foley last season and then was unceremoniously cut by Bill Parcells in June after refusing to take a $ 2.2 million pay cut .
Of Blake 's and O ' Donnell 's comments , Foley said he was `` totally surprised . ''
`` They never said anything to me , '' Foley said .
Foley 's latest challenger is Vinny Testaverde , a Heisman Trophy winner who joined the Jets in June and has been promised that if he outplays Foley , he will start .
But their relationship appears to be good .
Foley has an ally in Coach Bill Parcells , who addressed the quarterback 's critics and those who wondered about his ability .
`` I told you what would happen , '' Parcells said as he considered Foley 's early camp troubles that included batted-down passes and incomplete throws .
`` I 've seen better from him .
I know what he can do . ''
In last Saturday 's scrimmage , Foley connected on 12 of 14 attempts and looked smart running the team .
O ' Donnell and Parcells agree on at least one area : that starting is different from coming in off the bench .
Parcells admits that that is an unknown factor in Foley 's future performance .
But Foley is here and O ' Donnell is not .
As Foley put it Tuesdy : `` He was unhappy .
He left unhappy . ''
EXTRA POINTS
It is almost game time and BILL PARCELLS is getting testy .
At the last full workout before the exhibition opener at Philadelphia , he counted bodies .
There were only 10 on the kickoff scout team .
`` Who 's missing , Mike ? ''
he shouted across the field to the special teams coach MIKE SWEATMAN .
`` KYLE BRADY , '' Sweatman shouted back .
`` Brady ! ''
Parcells commanded , and pointed to the far fence 60 yards away .
Brady ran to the fence and back .
When practice was ending , Parcells still wasn n't happy .
There was an offsides .
He had the entire offense run to that fence .
Finally , after practice , Parcells made all 80 players line up in a 3-point stance .
If just one player jumped offsides before Parcells blew the whistle , the entire unit had to start again .
They did it a dozen times .
Running back CURTIS MARTIN will be held out Thursday if he is not over his hamstring injury .
.
.
.
The Jets will use three quarterbacks in the game : GLENN FOLEY , VINNY TESTAVERDE and RAY LUCAS .
CHUCK CLEMENTS will get a chance to play in the club 's second exhibition , against Baltimore .
.
.
BRYAN COX lost six pounds in his first day with the club on Monday , Parcells said .
He said he expects the linebacker to be in shape by the season 's opener .
