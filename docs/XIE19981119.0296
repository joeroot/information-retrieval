Davenport Highlights Action Tonight at Chase Championship
Davenport , who is assured of becoming the first American-born woman to end the year as the world 's top-ranked players since Chris Evert in 1981 , will battle Sandrine Testud of France in the night match at Madison Square Garden .
Also tonight , fifth seed Americna Monic Seles will try to shake off the effects of food poisoning against a slumping Anna Kournikova of Russia .
In today 's first match , sixth seed Mary Pierce of France overpowered South African Amanda Coetzer to post a 6 - 1 , 6 - 0 victory .
Davenport , who earned the biggest victory of her career in New York at the U.S. Open , wrapped up the year 's to ranking Monday when Spain 's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario lost to Irina Sirlea of Romania .
That loss denied No. 2 Hingis the opportunity to collect bonus points she would have needed to unseat Davenport .
Tonight 's encounter is a rematch of the finals of the Porsche Grand Prix , played in October in Filderstadt , Germany .
In that match , the 14th - ranked Testud earned her only title of the year with a 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 victory .
However , the tall American owns a 6 - 2 lead in the all-time series .
Davenport is coming off a loss to Germany 's Steffi Graf in last week 's Advanta Championships in Philadelphia .
But she has won a tour-leading six titles this season .
Seles has won 10 of her last 12 matches since falling to Hingis in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open , but she became sick from a meal last week and spent all of Monday and the better part of Tuesday in bed recovering .
Seles won three consecutive Chase Championship titles from 1990 - 1992 .
Kournikova is hoping for a recovery of a different kind .
The 17-year-old Russian , making her debut at the year-ending event tonight , has lost three straight matches and has committed 37 double faults in her last two outings .
