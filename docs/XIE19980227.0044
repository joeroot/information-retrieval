Germany Set to Meet Euro Budget Deficit Target : Officials
BONN , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Germany is expected to announce Friday a budget deficit of 2.9 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) for 1997 , which is in line with the conditions set by the European Union for joining the planned single European currency euro , German government sources said Thursday .
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was expected to confirm the budget deficit data at a press conference Friday , based on an economic report to be submitted by the German Statistics Office , government officials said .
Under the EU Maastricht Treaty , a member state must bring its 1997 budget deficit to no more than 3 percent of GDP in order to join the euro , which is due to be launched on January 1 , 1999 .
Moreover , euro criteria also require EU states to cut overall national debt to no more than 60 percent of GDP .
Officials said that Germany is likely to overshoot the second target slightly with an overall national debt of about 2.1 trillion marks ( 1.2 trillion U.S. dollars ) in 1997 , or about 61 percent of GDP .
However , it is widely expected that this will not prevent Germany from joining the euro from its start .
The final decision on the euro membership will be made by leaders of the 15 EU member states in early May on the basis of official convergence reports to be published by the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute .
