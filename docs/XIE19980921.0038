EU Deplores Failure of Working Time Negotiation
BRUSSELS , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The European Commission said Monday that it was disappointed by the failure of the negotiations to reach agreement on working time .
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock and Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn said in a joint statement that a great opportunity had been missed .
The Federation of Transport Workers Unions in the European Union and the International Road Union met here Monday in a desperate effort to reach agreement on working hours for the mobile sector of the EU 's road transport .
But the two organizations , representing the truck , coach and taxi drivers and employers respectively , failed to agree with each other .
The European Commission , the executive body of the 15-nation European Union , said that it would have to table its own proposals on working time if there is no agreement on September 30 .
The commission suggested that the two organizations meet again on September 30 to make a final attempt at reaching agreement .
The European Council of Ministers set forth in 1993 a regulation concerning working time for all sectors except for road transport .
The commission suggested last year to extend the working time regulation to all non-mobile workers in the road transport sector .
The commission provided those directly involved in road transport with an opportunity to reach agreement for themselves , commission officials said .
The commission , the officials added , had wished that the social partners of labor and management could jointly find acceptable solutions for themselves .
The negotiations , that kept on and off for several months , led to two strike-triggered road blockades by French hauliers that had seriously hampered the trade within the European Union .
