NEW YORK _ Nine love letters that are to be sold at auction in New York later this month reveal a liaison that took place between Albert Einstein and a married Russian woman in the United States in the closing months of World War II that may have been a good deal more dangerous than the physicist ever realized at the time .
All the letters were written by Einstein , the father of the theory of relativity , to Margarita Konenkova between 1945 and 1946 .
They have been passed on to Sotheby 's , the auction house , by an unnamed relative of Konenkova .
With other mementoes of the affair , they will be sold on June 26 .
The missives reveal a man smitten with a woman who at the time was married to the Russian sculptor , Sergei Konenkov .
She had apparently also had had an affair with Sergei Rachmaninov .
Whether the relationship began before or after the death in 1936 of Einstein 's second wife , Elsa , is not clear .
Much more likely to stir fascination in the sale , however , are suggestions that Konenkova was a Russian spy and that introducing Einstein to Soviet diplomats in New York was part of her mission .
Konenkova 's secret side was , according to the New York Times , uncovered first by Paul Needham , a consultant to Sotheby 's .
Needham stumbled on references to her in a 1995 book written by Soviet spymaster Pavel Sudoplatov and his son Anatoly , called `` Special Tasks . ''
Konenkova , the book suggests , had been directed by Moscow to pay special attention to the Manhattan Project .
Headed by scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer at a secret installation in the New Mexico desert called Los Alamos , the Manhattan Project was the cradle of America 's atomic bomb .
According to `` Special Tasks , '' Konenkova was supposed to `` influence Oppenheimer and other prominent American scientists who she frequently met at Princeton . ''
Princeton University was home at the time to Einstein .
It is known that she succeeded in introducing Einstein to the Soviet consul in New York .
There is nothing in Einstein 's letters , all written in German , to suggest that the author had any notion of Konenkova 's role as a spy .
And since Einstein had no direct role in the Manhattan Project , it seems improbable that he could have helped , consciously or otherwise , in Moscow 's effort to build its own bomb .
Instead , the letters reveal a soppy side to Einstein that has barely been seen before .
In one , dated Nov. 27 , 1945 , he writes : `` Just recently I washed my head by myself , but not with the greatest success ; I am not as careful as you are .
But everything here reminds me of you : ` Almar 's ' shawl , the dictionaries , the wonderful pipe that we thought was gone , and really all the many little things in my hermit 's cell ; and also the lonely nest . ''
`` Almar , '' it is supposed , is an elision of the first names Albert and Margarita .
