NEW YORK CAPTURES AFC EAST
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By WILL McDONOUGH c.1998 The Boston Globe
BUFFALO _ The game ball delivered is certain to find a special spot in Leon Hess 's home .
Hess , 84 years old and not in the best of health , was not here yesterday to see his New York Jets give him something he has never had as the primary owner of the team _ a divisional title .
The Jets accomplished that by beating a stubborn Buffalo team , 17 - 10 , in a windy Ralph Wilson Stadium .
With either a victory over the Patriots in their regular-season finale in Giants Stadium next week or a Jacksonville loss in either of their final two games , the Jets ( 11 - 4 ) will end up with the second-best record in the AFC and a bye in the first round of the playoffs .
`` We deserve this , '' said Jets coach Bill Parcells .
`` To beat Seattle in a tough game , and then beat Miami and these guys back to back on the road , to me that means we earned this the hard way . ''
Winning the division championship is a major achievement for the Jets , who had not won one since they were members of the AFL in 1969 , the year they also won the Super Bowl .
In almost every preseason poll , the Jets were picked to finish third in the division behind New England and Miami .
Fittingly , it was Vinny Testaverde , who should be the comeback player of the year , winning it for the Jets with a quick-strike 71-yard touchdown pass to Dedric Ward in the third quarter to break a 10 - 10 tie and produce the final margin .
The game was hampered by high , gusty winds of 30 miles per hour that affected both the passing and kicking games .
The Jets came into the game assured of a playoff berth .
The Bills ( 9 - 6 ) were a game behind and needed a win to help their playoff chances .
They still could gain a wild-card berth .
The game featured a wonderful story line with Doug Flutie and Testaverde , both benchwarmers when the season started , going head to head .
Testaverde struck first when he threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Wayne Chrebet on a crossing pattern to give his team a 7 - 0 lead .
A 25-yard Testaverde-to-Keyshawn Johnson connection set up the score .
The Jets had the wind in this drive .
Buffalo got the wind in the second quarter and used it to drive 79 yards in 11 plays .
The Bills scored on a 25-yard screen pass from Flutie to Thurman Thomas .
The play call was perfect , with the Jets getting caught in a blitz .
The rush was on Flutie so fast , he virtually flipped the ball over his shoulder .
But the ball landed right in the arms of Thomas , who picked up two key blocks and cut back behind the last defender for the touchdown .
Buffalo missed a great chance to take control of the game at the end of the first half .
The Bills marched from their own 1-yard line to the Jets 5 with five seconds left in the half .
But they were penalized back to the 10 for delay of game , missed a pass , and then an easy 28-yard field goal .
Instead of leading , the Bills went into halftime with the game tied at 7.
The teams swapped field goals early in the third quarter , tying the score at 10 and setting up the critical play of the game .
With second and 1 at their own 2 l , the Jets sent Testaverde back to pass .
Ward and defensive back Donovan Greer were man to man along the left sideline .
`` Our guy ( Greer ) thought he was going to run a quick sideline ( route ) and cut in front of him trying to look for the interception , '' said Bills coach Wade Phillips .
`` He almost had one earlier on a quick out . ''
The mistake was critical .
Ward was up the field and Greer couldn n't recover .
Ward caught the ball on the Bills 38 , shook Greer , and ran alone down the sideline for the Jets ' biggest score in years .
`` The wind was an important factor , '' said Phillips .
`` It was hard for both quarterbacks to throw the ball .
Doug had trouble , and Vinny had trouble .
We held them to something like 250 yards of offense ( actually 269 ) , and we still couldn n't win .
They made the big plays . ''
Testaverde finished 14 for 23 for 184 yards .
Flutie was 14 for 38 for 220 yards with one interception .

David Meggett , who didn n't join the team until last Tuesday , was all over the field .
On his first carry of the day , on third down , he ran 17 yards up the middle .
He also returned kicks and played in the Jets ' third -- and-long situations ...
It was Flutie 's first home regular-season loss in his NFL career ...
According to Phillips , `` The Jets played us the same way they did before ( when they beat the Bills in New York in midseason ) .
They didn n't do anything different . ''
The Jets ' game plan was the same on defense .
They tried to rush five men most of the time , keeping them in their rush lanes , forcing Flutie to throw .
