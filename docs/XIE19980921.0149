El Paso , ACOM to Build 1,000-km Oil Pipeline in
DAR ES SALAAM , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- American and Tanzanian companies have contracted to build a 1,000-kilometer oil pipeline at a cost of 400 million U.S. Dollars .
The line , extending from the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam to the Mwanza Region in the northwest , will be able to transport about 1.2 million tons of petroleum products annually .
The U.S . - based El Paso Energy International and the Africommerce International Limited ( ACOM ) of Tanzania have a joint share of more than 50 percent of the project which is to be launched in 1998 and completed in 2002 .
Vice-President of El Paso International for Europe and Africa , Bradley Lingo , and ACOM chairman Elisante Muro , signed an agreement for the the development of the project here last week , local newspapers said Monday .
The rest of the money will be pooled by banking institutions and multilateral agencies like the International Monetary Fund , the International Finance Corporation , and the African Development Bank , Lingo said .
He named others as the Commonwealth Development Corporation , the Eastern African Development Bank , and the South African Development Bank .
The line will provide a reliable supply to Mwanza , a Lake Victoria region , which has one third of Tanzania 's population , as well as to Burundi , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Rwanda and Uganda , Muro said .
Muro , however , acknowledged that the project will face stiff competition from similar facilities in east Africa , including the Nairobi-Eldoret pipeline in Kenya , which is due to be extended to the Ugandan capital of Kampala .
