UNASSUMING TEXAN HASN ' T GONE HOLLYWOOD , BUT STILL THE KING OF COUNTRY MUSIC
( EDS : Accompanied by ELUSIVE GEORGE STRAIT ) ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By DAVE FERMAN c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Several years ago , Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for George Strait 's boxed set , `` Strait Out of the Box . ''
She asked for every interview Strait had done and was given a thin folder with a small batch of articles .
Fine , she said .
What year is this ?
No , she was told , that 's it : total .
All the press on the man who then , as now , was one of the most popular singers in country music .
Three years later , `` Strait Out of the Box '' is one of the most popular boxed sets of all time .
Strait is selling out football stadiums nationwide , averaging 50,000 fans per night without doing any press or TV _ The New York Times , David Letterman , Jay Leno and even Oprah all having asked for an interview and all having been firmly , but politely , told no.
And Kay West sits laughing in her Nashville office .
`` That little folder wasn n't even 2 inches thick , '' says West , Strait 's longtime publicist .
`` Garth generates 2 inches of press in 15 seconds .
George Strait just does not leave footprints as far as the media goes .
He doesn n't do anything .
And he doesn n't make exceptions . ''
That is the dichotomy of Strait 's career .
At 46 , the Pearsall , Texas , native remains the living embodiment of the quiet lone cowboy .
His catalog of hits and the 39 million CDs he has sold help him fill the largest venues in America , but he can still slip out of his stardom and go back to life as an authentic South Texas rancher as easily as most folks take off a pair of jeans .
The shirts stay firmly starched .
The little half-smile stays put .
The gaze stays steady .
The hat stays on .
The music stays pure honky-tonk country with more than a hint of western swing .
The deep , water-over-a-stream-bed voice keeps its lived-in luster .
And the fans _ young and old , male and female _ keep showing up as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career : This year 's tour , officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy Truck Country Music Festival , totals just 18 dates , including Saturday 's show at Texas Stadium .
Strait , West says , stipulated that the shows be on Saturdays and Sundays only so he can fly home ( he has a home in San Antonio and a ranch somewhere in South Texas ) on his private plane for several days each week .
And then , after the final show at Houston 's Rice Stadium on Sunday , June 7 , Strait will go back to attending rodeos and spending time with his wife , Norma ( they 've been married more than 25 years ) , and 17-year-old son George Junior , known as Bubba , even as his latest CD , `` One Step at a Time , '' stays fixed in the Top Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth Brooks , Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes .
Country fans and performers alike seem to get younger every year _ but Strait , amazingly , has sold as well in the '90s as in the '80s , when he burst into prominence .
The soundtrack to the 1992 movie `` Pure Country '' sold 5 million copies .
Since that year , Strait has been the 10th - most-popular musical act of any genre .
This appears more phenomenal considering Strait 's low media profile .
After years as a bar musician ( he was discovered in 1981 while based in San Marcos ) and spending the '80s playing hundreds of dates per year as his national popularity grew , Strait long ago found his own balance between personal and professional .
He will not tour till he drops , and several years ago ended his annual New Year 's Eve show at Dallas ' Reunion Arena to spend the night at home with his family .
He will not curry favor with Nashville or hang out with movie stars or record duets with rock stars or do anything else designed to keep his name out there just a little longer or get one more fan to buy one more CD .
He will sell as well as he does playing by his rules , and that will be that .
For example , says West , after the success of `` Pure Country '' ( in which Strait played , gosh , a country singer who loves rodeo ! ) , he was deluged with movie offers : a sequel , other roles , big money .
And he turned them all down , she says , because he simply didn n't want to make another movie .
`` He did ` Pure Country ' because he got a script he liked , he could do it in Texas , and he had some time off , '' she says .
`` It was relatively painless .
But it wasn n't because he wanted to give his career a boost .
`` He 's talked about this casually .
His life 's been consistent and steady , and he really values that .
How much longer is Bubba going to be at home ?
He doesn n't want to be on the road when his son 's growing up , and when he 's ready to stay home , his son is out of the house . ''
Billy Bob 's Texas marketing director Pam Minick has known Strait for more than a decade ; she says the Strait you hear and the Strait you see in his simple videos is the genuine article .
When not onstage , she says , he 's so unwilling to call attention to himself that he sometimes enters rodeo competitions under an assumed name .
`` He 's just a very humble , unassuming gentleman ; that 's why , in one respect , he doesn n't enjoy the hoopla , '' says Minick , who first saw Strait when he was opening ( yes , opening ) for Rusty Weir in 1982 .
`` It 's sincere .
He 's almost embarrassed when people ask for his autograph .
Obviously , he still loves the response _ but he doesn n't like to talk about himself . ''
MORE
All those years of keeping the focus on the music means that people now don n't expect any details , juicy or otherwise .
And it 's not as if Strait is a total mystery .
We know he grew up in Pearsall ; his parents separated when George was young ; and he and his older brother , Buddy , were raised by his father , John , a math teacher and part-time rancher .
We know that Strait attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos , enlisted in the Army in 1971 , and was in for three years , stationed in Hawaii .
That is where he began singing in a band ; when he returned to San Marcos ( he graduated with a degree in agriculture ) , he began playing bars , gradually becoming more and more popular .
And we know that Strait signed with MCA in February 1981 ; his first single for the label , `` Unwound , '' charted in early May , just before he turned 29 .
His first LP , `` Strait Country , '' was released that September , and within a few years _ on the strength of songs such as `` Right or Wrong , '' `` Amarillo by Morning '' and `` You Look So Good in Love '' _ he was a major star .
Then , on June 25 , 1986 , his 13-year-old daughter , Jenifer , was killed in a car accident near San Marcos .
Strait 's career has continued to prosper despite changing times ; he was named the Country Music Association 's Entertainer of the Year in 1989 and 1990 and was named Male Vocalist of the Year four times by the CMA and three times by the Academy of Country Music .
He is a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and hosts the George Strait Team Roping Classic each June in Kingsville .
And then , of course , there was The Dog Incident : In 1996 his Australian heeler , Buster , disappeared from his South Texas ranch .
Strait offered a reward , and half the state , it seems , went looking for the dog .
Buster was never found .
`` This tells you about George 's status in Texas , '' says West .
`` You can n't imagine the phone calls , the number of people thinking they had found him . ''
John Wheat , sound archivist for the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin , says Strait `` appeals to people who want at least a modicum of authenticity .
People still revere western culture , and authenticity is hard to find in country music .
He isn n't trying to fit his music into pop music trends .
Country has folk music roots _ it 's concerned with people 's daily lives _ and George is still in that camp .
`` He doesn n't sell himself as competing with rock bands .
He knows about ranching , and he doesn n't get away from it and go live in Los Angeles or Nashville .
He 's a quiet , strong , self-effacing character .
He holds himself back , and people appreciate it . ''
Linda O ' Brian , music director and assistant program director at Dallas-Fort Worth radio station KSCS / 96.3 FM , says Strait appeals because he `` just seems so normal .
Everything he does is done with this quiet strength _ you don n't think of him as having issues , so people don n't ask about him .
They just want to meet him .
Everybody wants to meet him .
He just has this really incredible sense of self ; the songs aren n't by him , because he 's not a songwriter , but they sound like him . ''
And thats , says old pal Clay Blaker , is the way Strait has always been .
The two met in 1976 , when they were both playing bars on the Austin / San Antonio / Houston circuit .
Blaker 's band did `` around 100 '' shows with Strait 's , and then Strait invited him along as an opener in the '80s .
Also , Strait has cut eight Blaker songs , including `` She Lays It All on the Line '' on the `` Pure Country '' soundtrack .
`` Whenever I 'm around him , he 's the same old George to me , '' says Blaker .
`` He 's very nice and polite and shy .
He 's always pretty much kept to himself , but he 's very friendly to his friends .
And he has a lot of the same friends he had before he got a record deal ; that 'll tell you something right there .
`` I think the reason he 's still at the top of his game can be attributed to you don n't see him in magazines all the time or on TV all the time ; there 's still a mystique about him that 's a result of the way he is .
In today 's market , there 's so many people that are so overexposed ; you 're a star for 15 minutes , and then you 're gone .
He 's a competitor , he takes his career real seriously , and he wants to go out there and prove he can still cut it . ''
Which , of course , he still can .
The question now is , how long will Strait 's career continue ?
Given what he 's chosen to do and chosen not to do , one can easily see him making one final , grand gesture , one final release and series of concerts , and then gracefully riding off into the sunset .
It might be a lame metaphor for many other singers , but not for him .
`` There 's an acknowledgement that this won n't go on forever , '' says West .
`` Eventually George will decide .
It won n't be decided for him .
He 's the master of his universe ; he controls his own fate . ''
And it 's very possible that , even at the very end , Strait will be what he 's always been : the lone figure on the plain , silent but for the songs he sings , not feeling the need to talk to anyone about his private life or career decisions .
With one exception .
`` He wants to talk to Cigar Aficionado magazine , '' says West with a chuckle .
`` He loves cigars , and he wants to do an interview .
I don n't know if they 'll do it _ they put a lot of Hollywood people on the cover _ but we 're testing the waters .
They haven n't asked . ''
