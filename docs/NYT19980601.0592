CLASSICAL CDS : BITTER , LIGHT , THEN GLORIFYING RUSSIA
( js ) By ALLAN KOZINN c.1998 N.Y .

Biography and historical context inevitably shape the way listeners understand a composer 's music , and in the case of Dmitri Shostakovich , those details are freighted with the nightmarish interaction between the composer and the Soviet state .
It 's hard to imagine , though , that even a listener entirely unaware of Shostakovich 's story could listen to his major works _ the symphonies , quartets and operas _ and not get a sense of what he was about .
It may be a confusing sense , actually : Works seeming to glorify the state mingle with works of bitterness and intensity that seem mainly to evoke struggle and protest .
It can seem , in fact , as if bitterness was his driving force .
But Shostakovich also had a lighter side .
Dmitri Kitaenko , conducting the Frankfurt Radio-Sinfonie Orchestra , offers four suites that are as cloud-free as anything Shostakovich composed ( RCA 09026 - 68304-2 ) .
Two of them , the Ballet Suites , Nos. 1 and 3 , are compilations of dances from Shostakovich 's early ballets and movements from his incidental music for the theater , cobbled together by Lev Atovmyan to help raise money for Shostakovich after he was denounced as a formalist in 1948 .
As such , the suites are meant to entertain rather than challenge , and they do so cheerily by way of lilting waltzes and vibrant galops , all orchestrated with the same vitality one hears in the more serious works .
Also on the disc are the two Suites for Jazz Orchestra , composed in 1934 and 1938 .
There is nothing particularly jazzy about them , although the closing fox trot of the Suite No. 1 could be mistaken for one of Kurt Weill 's Berlin cabaret works , in both instrumentation and melodic accent .
Shostakovich 's light side sometimes had a biting edge , as in `` Rayok , '' a satirical 20-minute opera originally scored for soloists and choir with piano accompaniment .
The work , which parodies Stalin and his functionaries and skewers their artistic pronouncements , was written for the private entertainment of Shostakovich 's musician friends and was not published in the composer 's lifetime .
The work has had several performances in New York , most recently in November , when Vladimir Spivakov led the Moscow Virtuosi in his own orchestration .
Spivakov and his orchestra have now recorded that version with the Moscow Choir Theater and its principal soloist , Aleksei Mochalov ( Musicmasters 01612 - 67189-2 ) .
The vivid performance conveys the work 's spirit , although Musicmasters was remiss in not including a translation of the text .
The disc also includes the song cycle `` From Jewish Poetry '' ( Op .
79 a ) , sung with moving beauty by Nikolai Kurpe , Marina Ahukova and Yelena Svechnikova , and a robust account of the invitingly lyrical Concertino ( Op .
94 ) , originally a piano duet but reworked as a piano concerto by Julia Ziberquit , who is the energetic soloist here .
Second-guessing Shostakovich 's scoring decisions , now a venerable industry , began during Shostakovich 's lifetime and with his approval .
These days the String Quartet No. 8 ( Op .
110 ) is heard more frequently in Rudolf Barshai 's expansion , as the Chamber Symphony ( Op .
110 b ) , than in its original form .
It is included , in a sharply accented , acid-toned and unusually high-contrast reading , on an all-Shostakovich disc by the Chamber Orchestra Kremlin , conducted by Misha Rachlevsky ( Claves CD 50 - 9115 ) .
Its companions are the Symphony for Strings ( Op .
118 b ) _ Barshai 's less-known orchestration of the String Quartet No. 10 _ and Rachlevsky 's transformation of the dark-hued Quartet No. 15 into a Requiem for Strings ( Op .
144 b ) .
The latest trend in midpriced reissues is to strip boxed sets of their jewel boxes and package the individual discs in cardboard sleeves .
This is good news for the space-conscious : A conventionally packaged Shostakovich symphony cycle takes about 5 inches of shelf space ; a compact new reissue of Mstislav Rostropovich 's recordings of the 15 Symphonies ( Teldec 0630 - 17046 , 12 compact discs ) takes only 1 inch .
More to the point , it is an eloquent and impassioned traversal .
Some of Rostropovich 's tempos and phrasing ideas are unconventional , but as an intimate of the composer he can claim a measure of authority , and his interpretive twists make for consistently compelling and enlightening listening .
