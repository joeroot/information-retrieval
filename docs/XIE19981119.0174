New Wedding Style Challenges Old Custom in Nepal
KATHMANDU , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Mass wedding is becoming a new life style in the Terai plain , the southern belt of Nepal where a dowry system has been prevailing for years .
The Kathmandu Post daily said Thursday that a Nepal National Marwari Mass Wedding Center had been formed in the Marwari community in the border city of Birganj .
The center discourages the dowry system , which is usually a nightmare for the poor families with several daughters .
Under Nepal 's dowry system , the bride is required to bring with her an amount of wealth as a dowry to the groom 's family .
Brides with a humble dowry are often reported to be abused .
In the indigenous communities in Terai , the birth of a daughter is regarded as a curse while the birth of a son is seen as a boon .
Of late , the center arranged a mass wedding ceremony for 39 couples , in which it provided clothes and jewelry to both the brides and grooms .
It spent 25,000 rupees ( about 400 U.S. dollars ) on each couple from donations .
" This is to discourage disparity .
We don n't want rich participants to display their wealth and make poor ones feel inferior , " the organizer was quoted as saying .
All the married couples are said to be living happily , the English-language paper reported .
General Secretary of the center Tara Chand Kedia said that those interested young people should first fill in a form and pay 100 rupees ( about 1.6 dollars ) , then submit their bio-data and personal preferences , they are entitled to participate in the center 's activities .
When women and men have selected their partners , the center will seek the permission from their respective parents .
After that , the two are introduced and given two weeks to acquaint with each other .
During this period , the center begins to investigate their backgrounds .
Even after they got married , the center continues to keep in touch with them to inquire about their well-being .
Such a wedding is good for women , Kedia said .
" We make the groom sign a guarantee that he will not harm the woman after marriage , " he added .
" The system of mass wedding is a very good start , " a local resident said .
" It is free from frivolities and also economical . "
