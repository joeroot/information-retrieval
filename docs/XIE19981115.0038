Iraq 's Aziz on Proposed Comprehensive Review
UNITED NATIONS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on Saturday stated Iraq 's views on the proposed comprehensive review in a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan .
In an annex to the letter , Aziz said the comprehensive review should be carried out within a very short time ( seven days for example ) after the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) resumes its work .
The security Council should be ready to implement its obligations termed in Resolution 687 of 1991 if Iraq has met all requirements set out by the resolution , Aziz said .
The Deputy Prime Minister said if the Security Council sees that more work needs to be done , a short period be set for that and in the meantime the Council takes measures for lifting or reducing sanctions in proportion to what has been fulfilled of the requirements termed in resolution 687 of 1991 .
The Council should fix the legal interpretation of section C of Resolution 687 of 1991 , and none of its members should impose additional conditions , Aziz added .
The annex also said " the question of Butler ( Executive Chairman of UNSCOM ) and the structure of UNSCOM and its practices are important matters .
The Council is to consider them seriously in order to ensure a good relationship in the future .
We hope that it will be done as soon as possible . "
Iraq stressed that everything enclosed in the annex did not constitute any conditions for it to make the decision to resume full cooperation with the United Nations .
Iraq on October 31 announced to halt all its ties with UNSCOM in charge of dismantling Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , prompting the possible military strike by the United States , which has massed heavy forces in the Gulf .
Due to shuttle diplomatic efforts by the international community , Iraq on Saturday decided to resume full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors .
