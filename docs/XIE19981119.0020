Republicans Pick Livingston as U.S. House Speaker
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday unanimously selected Representative Bob Livingston from Louisiana to be next speaker .
Livingston is replacing Newt Gingrich who resigned after the November 3 elections .
Livingston , 55 , was chosen in a closed party meeting .
Livingston will officially be elected by the full House for a two-year term when the chamber reconvenes January 6.
Although Democrats traditionally nominate their own top leader Richard Gephardt for the post , with a 223 to 211 Republican majority , Livingston 's victory is assured .
" There are some who insist the Republican era is over .
But that 's like saying the American dream is over .
It isn n't true -- and they know it , " Livingston said in his speech to the Republican conference .
Gingrich handed the gavel to Livingston and praised his ability to unite the party .
Earlier , Livingston said he saw the job as one to run the House smoothly and pointed to his experience as head of the powerful Appropriations Committee , the panel that controls annual government spending .
