Crude Futures Prices Reach All Time Low
LONDON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The price for prompt January Brent Crude crashed Wednesday morning to 11.20 / bl , the lowest level ever recorded , 10 c less than the previous low of 11.30 / bl on October 5 , 1998 , the International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) announced .
Analysts have attributed the weakness in oil prices to a variety of factors including growth in supply , particularly from non-Opec countries ; a fall in demand from Asia due to the economic crisis in this region , and high stock levels .
The IPE said that low prices this year contributed to a surge in volume of trade at the IPE .
So far this year business has increased almost a third compared with the same period last year .
In November daily volumes of trade in oil have averaged just under 90,000 lots , equivalent to about 85 million barrels a day .
This volume is greater than total daily world oil consumption .
Lynton Jones , chief executive of the IPE said " this year 's low prices have reinforced the need for effective risk management tools to all those companies which are exposed to energy price volatility . "
" Any one whose profit margin depends significantly on oil sales or purchases has seen the benefits of hedging clearly demonstrated in recent months , " he added .
The IPE launched the Brent Crude futures contract on 23 June 1988 .
It forms a key part of the complex used as a benchmark for pricing two thirds of the world 's internationally traded oil supplies .
