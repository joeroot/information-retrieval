U.S. Orders Three Cuban Diplomats Out
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States ordered three U.N . - based Cuban diplomats to leave the country " for activities incompatible with their diplomatic status . "
One was accused of spying in an investigation last September and two other Cubans who were alleged to have engaged in similar activities voluntarily left the country several weeks ago , said officials .
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the Cuban mission was informed the three were being expelled " for activities incompatible with their diplomatic status . "
Rubin said the decision to expel the three was made as a result of evidence developed in an " exhaustive investigation by the FBI . "
They were given until next Tuesday to leave .
Their identities were not disclosed , but one was said to be a mid - to senior-level official for Cuban President Fidel Castro 's government , the other two lower level .
Ten people arrested in Miami last September were charged with trying to penetrate U.S. military bases , infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political organizations .
At the time , prosecutors said it was the biggest Cuban spy ring discovered in the United States since Castro took power in 1959 .
No U.S. secrets were obtained by the group , the Pentagon said .
The department gave the Cuban mission 24 hours to argue against the expulsions , the official said , but it received no response before the deadline .
Officials said about 10 Cuban diplomats have been expelled by the United States since the early 1980s .
