Turkish Independent Lawmaker Authorized to Form
ANKARA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel Wednesday appointed an independent lawmaker to form a new government as a previously-assigned party leader failed to get enough support in parliament .
Demirel picked up independent Yalim Erez , the industry and trade minister , after Bulent Ecevit , leader of the Democratic Left Party , failed to secure a majority in parliament .
On Monday , Ecevit returned the mandate to form a new government to the president .
Demirel said he believed an independent lawmaker can obtain wide support from Turkey 's bickering political parties .
The government led by Mesut Yilmaz , who is now acting Prime Minister , collapsed last month in a no-confidence vote growing out of his corruption scandals .
Demirel did not appoint the leader of the largest party to form a cabinet as such an appointment will bring the pro-Islamic Virtue Party to power , infuriating pro-secular military .
Erez , a businessman-turned-politician , was chosen partly because he sided with the pro-secular establishment .
Erez resigned as Industry and Trade Minister in a earlier coalition between the center-right True Path Party led by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and the pro-Islamic Welfare Party in April 1997 , two months after the military warned the government to strictly act on the secular constitution .
After a brief meeting with Demirel , Erez said that " I am in equal distance with all the parties in search for a new government .
I will look for compromise and dialog and will meet with the leaders of all political parties in the parliament . "
" I believe that the government I will form will win the vote of confidence in the parliament , " he added .
Erez , 54 , will first face a vote of no-confidence in parliament to determine if he can muster a majority of votes to form a government .
Erez also said " I am conscious of the responsibility of the assignment which the president gave me in a very period when our country faces with very important internal and external problems . "
The prime minister designate said that he will form a " broad-based compromise government . "
" I believe that I will agree with Ciller , " who had said she was unhappy with Erez .
