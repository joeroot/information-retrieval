Annan Concerned Over Continuing Military Activities in Lebanon
UNITED NATIONS , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday expressed his concern over the continuing military activities in Lebanon .
In a statement , Annan said he deplored the death of Lebanese civilians in an Israeli air raid which once again resulted in civilian casualties and prompted the firing of rockets by Lebanese armed elements into northern Israel , endangering Israeli civilians .
The Secretary-General urged the parties concerned to put an end to the violence and , in particular , to respect the non-combatant status of civilians .
Israeli planes raided suspected pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrilla targets in the Bekaa Valley on Tuesday , which raised to 110 the number of Israeli raids on Lebanon since the start of 1988 .
