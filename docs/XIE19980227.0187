Transportation Upgrades Revitalize Old Revolutionary Base
JINAN , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Complicated topographical features served as a natural bulwark for Linyi revolutionists during the Chinese War of Liberation ( 1946 - 1949 ) , but nonetheless created major barriers hindering modernization .
A road construction program carried out over the past decade has reshaped the local transportation system .
Major roads in the area currently stretch 4,682 km , including 1,500 km of trunk roads .
County roads cover 3,182 km effectively linking more than 1,000 booming wholesale markets .
Linyi is located in mountainous Yimeng Prefecture , a famous revolutionary base in east China 's Shandong Province .
The city is rapidly gaining a reputation as one of the province 's major commodity distributing centers .
Export commodities ranging from edible oil , vegetables , handicrafts , light chemicals , pharmaceuticals , textiles and garments to machinery are sold in over 100 countries and regions .
Linyi has not only built more roads , but also has focused on road maintenance and landscaping projects .
