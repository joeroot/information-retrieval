LONG BEACH STATE ELIMINATES FLORIDA STATE
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By GORDON VERRELL Long Beach Press-Telegram
OMAHA , Neb. _ & UR ; & LR ; For half a dozen innings Sunday night , Long Beach State 's 49 ers tried to play Snow Ball , and it wasn n't getting them much .
Finally , in the seventh , they resorted to what has become college baseball 's all-too-familiar weapon : the three-run homer .
And because of it , the 49 ers have a Snow Ball 's chance at the 52nd College World Series after all .
Long Beach State 's 7 - 4 victory over third-seeded Florida State the result of Scott Redfox 's second career homer , a three-run shot that snapped a 4 - 4 tie earned the 49 ers a rematch with No. 2-seeded Miami on Tuesday .
And it sent Florida State , a first-round loser to Arizona State , packing , the first team ousted from the double-elimination tournament .
Nothing new there .
`` We 've been on that early flight back home so many times I even know when to set the alarm clock , '' said FSU coach Mike Martin , a punch-in the-belly reminder that the Seminoles have made more trips to Omaha , 16 now , than anyone else without landing a national championship .
`` We weren n't overmatched , '' said Martin , `` we just got beat . ''
Shocked is more like it .
`` Redfox really surprised us , '' Martin admitted .
`` He had one homer going in ...
but he really put a charge into that ball . ''
Dave Snow , the 49 ers ' coach , had been looking for some kind of offensive charge , especially after the Dirtbags managed just four singles in their 3 - 1 loss to Miami in the first round .
Snow also was quick to take note of the wind when he arrived at Rosenblatt Stadium , which so far , in only six games , has helped produce the staggering total of 23 home runs .
With a stiff wind blowing toward right field , he juggled his original lineup slightly , getting lefty-swinging Chuck Lopez into the No. 2 spot .
And he started Redfox at second base .
`` He 's had some big hits for us lately , he 's had a hot bat , '' Snow said of Redfox , who started only a handful of games until late in the season , but has been on fire in the post-season : 12 for 31 ( . 387 ) .
`` He didn n't start the first game ( against Miami ) just because it was the first game and ( Curt ) Lee is a little more of a stabilizer on defense .
`` Today , '' Snow added , `` with the wind , it was an easy decision . ''
The 49 ers , as usual , dug themselves a hole , falling behind , 4 - 1 , after only four innings .
FSU 's freshman right fielder , Matt Diaz , walloped a three-run homer in the top of the fourth off starter Caleb Balbuena .
First baseman Jason Yount , who 'd managed only two extra-base hits in his last 23 games , homered in the 49 ers ' fourth , a solo shot .
The 49 ers tied the score with a three-run fifth , the key hit a two-run , bases-loaded single by designated hitter Mike Hota another spit in the wind by Snow , who 'd started Hota just two other games all season .
But the 49 ers left the bases loaded in the fifth , and again in the sixth , stranding no fewer than 10 baserunners the first six innings .
`` The dugout didn n't let down , even then , '' Sbnow said .
`` We didn n't get frustrated . ''
But the 49 ers ( 42 - 22-1 ) certainly frustrated the Seminoles ( 53 - 20 ) in the top of the seventh .
Balbuena hit the first batter of the inning , Kevin Cash , then gave up a single to Karl Jernigan the Seminoles ' only hit over the last five innings .
That brought sinkerballer Darren Merrill out of the bullpen .
Anticipating a bunt , the 49 ers put on a play .
Paul Day charged from third base , and shortstop Justin Hall dashed toward third .
Cash , on second , bit .
He took off for third along with Hall .
Merrill before he 'd so much as thrown a pitch to the plate whirled and fired to Redfox , who 'd slipped in to cover second .
Cash was out , `` a bonehead play on my part , '' he said , and soon the 49 ers were out of the inning .
In the 49 ers ' seventh , one-out infield singles by Yount and Hall brought Redfox to the plate .
`` I went up trying to get a good swing and go with the pitch , '' said Redfox , who hit his only other collegiate homer two months ago against New Mexico State .
`` I got my hands extended and got it up in the wind . ''
And into the right field seats .
Redfox was mobbed by his teammates once he reached home plate , finally breaking into a smile once he reached the dugout .
`` I 'm not even sure right now that it really happened , '' Redfox said later , still stunned .
Asked if he actually saw the ball carry into the stands , Redfox admitted he watched it as best he could .
`` If I was going to hit one out of here , '' he said , smiling , `` I kind of wanted to see it go . ''
Merrill ( 7 - 0 ) , who 's worked four hitless innings in two CWS appearances emerged the winner .
Jason Marr hurled a 1 - 2-3 ninth for his eighth save .
So far in their two games , the 49 ers ' pitching has been superb , allowing just seven runs on 14 hits over 17 innings , a far cry from everyone else here , who averaged better than 18 runs a game .
Mike Gallo , who pitched into the seventh inning on Friday against Miami , is one of Snow 's choices to start Tuesday 's rematch against the Hurricanes , an elimination for both teams ( Miami lost to unbeaten Arizona State , 9 - 2 , earlier Sunday ) .
`` But I 'll have to talk to him , '' Snow said .
`` We could go with ( freshman right-hander Jeff ) Leuenberger and bring Gallo in from the bullpen if we have to .
He 's used to getting the ball as a reliever , anyway . ''
The 49 ers got one other major break , in the third inning , when Jose Zapata tried to score from third on what appeared to be a wild pitch .
Only the ball caromed straight back to catcher Bryan Kennedy and , as Zapata explained later , `` I was out by a mile . ''
Said Snow : `` I thought for a minute we were playing handball . ''
Nah , just Snow Ball .
