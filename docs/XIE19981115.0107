APEC Ministers Want EVSL Settled in Kuala Lumpur
Kuala Lumpur , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Ministers from the APEC ( Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ) member economies want the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization ( EVSL ) issue to be settled here at the ministerial level , Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told reporters here today .
He said that the ministers at the tenth APEC ministerial meeting are expected to make a final decision on the EVSL issue this afternoon .
Meanwhile , Australian deputy Prime minister Tim Fischer said some progress has been made on the EVSL scheme .
He said the ministers are working to solve the sticky points in implementing landmark tariff cuts under the EVSL , following Japan 's insistence that it would not reduce tariffs on fishery and forestry products due to domestic political sensitivities .
The EVSL scheme which was agreed upon in the last APEC meeting in Vancouver seeks to cut tariffs in nine sectors -- fishery products , forestry products , gems and jewelry , toys , chemical products , energy , electronics , medical equipment and telecommunication .
