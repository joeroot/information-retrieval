Ugandan Official Denies Responsibility in Valley
KAMPALA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- A senior Ugandan official has denied responsibility in the award of the fraudulent contract which caused the loss of over three billion Shillings ( 3 million U.S. Dollars ) meant for valley dams and valley tanks in the southwestern region .
Kezimbira Miyingo , State Minister for Agriculture in charge of Animal Industry , made the denial at parliament Wednesday , Radio Uganda reported in the evening .
Before the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture which is probing the misuse of the fund , Miyingo said his advice and attempt to withhold the contract was overlooked by technocrats in the ministry .
Anthony Kanyike , chairman of the committee , said that parliament is under obligation to find out why and who was responsible for the loss of the funds in the Ministry of Agriculture .
Previously , there were reports that millions of Dollars meant for building valley dams and tanks in the region disappeared from the ministry .
At present a select committee is conducting investigation into the issue .
Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe , who is also the Minister of Agriculture , is reportedly responsible for the loss of the money .
The valley dam scandal , coupled with the Uganda Commercial Bank scandal , tainted the image of the ruling National Resistance Movement and there is an increasing public outcry for checking the rampant corruption among senior government officials .
