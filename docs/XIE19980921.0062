Nepal 's Main Opposition Wins District Polls
KATHMANDU , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxism-Leninism , CPN-UML ) Monday emerged the winner again in the polls held last Friday in the 11 districts of the mid-western development region .
Results show that the CPN-UML bagged five posts of chairman in Dailekh , Surkhet , Mugu , Jumla and Dolpa in addition to seven posts of vice chairman .
The party won the posts of both chairman and vice chairman in Dailekh , Surkhet , Mugu and Dolpa .
Besides , its 48 candidates were elected members of the district development committees ( DDC ) in all the 11 districts .
And in Dolpa , the party won all the nine posts of member , a party official said .
A total of 11 chairmen and 11 vice chairmen along with 116 members were elected for the DDCs in Dolpa , Mugu , Humla , Jumla , Kalikot , Dang , Piuthan , Banke , Bardiya , Dailekh and Surkhet .
The ruling Nepali Congress ( NC ) was the runner-up with four chairman posts in Dang , Banke , Bardiya and Humla and one vice chairman post .
Twenty-two of the NC 's candidates were elected members in some districts .
The Communist Party of Nepal ( Marxism-Leninism , CPN-ML ) , which broke away from the CPN-UML in March this year and joined the government in late August , did not win a single key post .
It lost even in Bardiya district , the constituency of its General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam where the NC and the CPN-UML formed an alliance .
Political parties formed alliance with one another in the elections considered crucial for them in the general elections due to be held before November 1999 .
Polls were not held last year in these districts because elections for village development committees ( VDC ) there were not completed due to violence by the ultra-leftist guerrillas .
Polls were held last year respectively for VDCs and municipalities in May and DDCs in July in 56 of the 75 districts in Nepal , in which the CPN-UML won a landslide victory .
But most of the mayors , deputy mayors , DDC chairmen , vice chairmen and members elected at that time have joined the CPN-ML .
As the CPN-ML and the splinter group of the National Democratic Party ( RPP ) led by former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand are yet to be recognized by the Election Commission as national parties , their candidates contested the elections as independents .
An independent backed by RPP ( Chand ) was elected vice chairman in Banke district , while the other RPP faction led by former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa won one seat of chairman and one seat of vice chairman .
The Election Commission said the polls were conducted peacefully in all the 11 districts .
