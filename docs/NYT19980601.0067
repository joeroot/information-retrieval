1998 Cox News Service
ATLANTA _ It 's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of compact discs , pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for , pop it into the CD player and hit play .
But wouldn n't it be nice to just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing ?
You can , if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player .
And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers .
One of the key advantages CD technology has over tapes and records is random access _ the ability to play the track you want without first listening to a bunch of other stuff .
The new Kenwood line means to take that idea one step further by making the CD player your storage unit as well .
What if you have in mind a musical feeling , but you really don n't want to spend a long time picking out individual tunes ?
Each of the new Kenwoods includes a memory function that lets users fill in data about each disc , designating one of 26 pre-programmed categories ( rock , jazz , classical , etc. ) .
Then if you wake up Sunday morning and want to hear Sam and Dave , Aretha , Otis or the Temptations , you just let the machine `` shuffle '' through the Motown genre .
On the other hand , if you want to play DJ for friends dropping by late some night , you can program up to 32 consecutive tracks that slide from Betty Carter to Frank Sinatra to Lena Horne to Percy Sledge .
Choose from any track among the up to 200 CDs loaded in the machine .
Kenwood has four machines in the 200-CD class , ranging from $ 230 to $ 500 in list price .
The top of the line , the CD-2280M , can play two discs simultaneously and send the audio to separate rooms .
For more information , contact Kenwood USA , Box 22745 , Long Beach , Calif. 90801 .
Burn your own
The urge to make your own CDs is also gaining increased momentum .
It is still illegal , of course , to make those recordings and sell them without a license from the owner of the songs .
Most music aficionados have their own Greatest Hits collections in their heads _ their own idea of what the best of Eric Clapton , Miles Davis or Brahms would be .
Digitization of music is making it possible to put those theoretical Greatest Hits onto discs .
For those with huge collections of vinyl they would love to put on disc , or perhaps those who want to cherry-pick the tunes in their own CD collections , then rearrange them in the right order , there are CD recorders .
Popular Science in its June issue offers a primer on recording CDs , with sidelong glances at other formats like DVD and mini-disc .
But say you want to select from a much larger database than you have on your shelves .
How about choosing from tens of thousands of songs ?
Then you might check out Custom Revolutions of Stamford , Conn.
The logic behind the company 's business is the logic of Internet commerce : the notion that billions of dollars in transactions will soon be done over the Net .
But the Net is not merely the conduit , since the digital world of cyberspace makes possible many arrangements that can play to consumer needs .
At the Web site of Custom Revolutions ( http://www.customdisc.com ) , consumers are invited to select as many or as few of the songs as they wish from the company library , which the company says will eventually include about 100,000 tunes it has licensed .
Each 10-track CD costs $ 18 plus shipping , and customers are also offered the option of `` personalizing '' the art for the case .
Browsers can listen to a 30-second clip from many of the tunes before buying , the company says .
Among the artists the company boasts so far is a fairly diverse list , leaning heavily toward the oldies _ at least so far .
Named by the company are Buddy Guy , Charlie Parker , Hot Tuna , Jim Croce and Nat King Cole .

Stop and identify
Just how picky are you about phone calls ?
Sure , we are all annoyed by that ill-timed call from a telemarketer , eccentric uncle or neighborhood gossip artist _ not to mention the boss .
The question is , just how much screening do you want your machines to do ?
And how many hoops do you demand a caller leap through before you will deign to pick up your phone ?
Caller ID , which shows you the caller 's number as the phone rings , is the most obvious option and is available from your local phone company for a monthly charge .
But maybe that is not enough for you .
If so , you might consider the Tele-Screen from the Edge Co. of Brattleboro , Vt.
Would you like callers to be greeted by a voice that says `` Please enter the four-digit pass code '' ?
If the caller doesn n't have your code , the phone doesn n't ring and the call is disconnected .
For information , call the Edge Co. ( 1 - 800-732-9976 ) or visit the company 's site ( http://www.edgeco.com ) .
VCR verbal
The videocassette recorder , despite its near-ubiquity in the homes of America , just might be the least understood of our most well-used products .
You can pop in a movie , but can you actually record on your VCR ?
Can you set it to tape something next week ?
Zenith responds with the SpeakEZ feature , an addition to its VCRs that the company says will actually talk you through the process of recording .
It works something like calling an office voice mail.Bela Lugosi
The cost of the machines with the feature ranges from $ 170 to $ 250 .
