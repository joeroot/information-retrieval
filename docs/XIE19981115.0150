Roundup : Myanmar Makes Third Cabinet Reshuffle in a Year
YANGON , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Myanmar carried out a major reshuffle of its 39-member cabinet Saturday for the third time in a single year since the formation of the 19-member State Peace and Development Council ( SPDC ) a year ago to replace the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) .
One more deputy prime minister , Lt. Gen. Tin Hla , was appointed , while retaining his current post of Minister of Military Affairs , thus bringing the number of deputy prime ministers to three after Lt. Gen. Tin Tun and Vice-Admiral Maung Maung Khin .
Of the four cabinet ministers changed , Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw , who served for more than 10 years in his post since the SLORC took over the power of state on September 18 , 1988 , was allowed to retire from duties and was replaced by U Win Aung , now the ambassador to Britain .
Former Minister of Transport Lt. Gen. Tin Ngwe , who was transferred to the Prime Minister 's Office as Minister , was replaced by former Minister of Industry-2 Maj. Gen. Hla Myint Swe .
The post of Minister of Industry-2 was taken by former Minister of Hotels and Tourism Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin , who is concurrently holding the chairmanship of the National Convention Convening Commission .
Of the 33 deputy ministers , two were to retire from duties , five newly appointed and one , who was deputy foreign minister U Nyunt Swe , reassigned as member of the Civil Service Selection and Training Board .
Shortly after the reshuffle , The SPDC appointed four new supreme court justices and allowed five former justices to retire , with the job of Chief Justice U Aung Toe remaining unchanged who still holds the chairmanship of the National Convention Convening Work Committee .
On November 15 , 1997 , Myanmar carried out the first major reshuffle of its cabinet as soon as the SPDC was formed , while the SLORC was dissolved .
The government said in its latest report on the political situation of Myanmar that the changes indicate the military government regards itself as a transitional or a caretaker government exacting a step-by-step transformation to democracy .
It argued that if the military government intends to hold on to power as it has been accused of by the Western governments , changes to the name of the government or members of its administration are not necessary , stressing that it is a change of substance , entity and identity .
The SPDC , formed then , retained four leaders of the SLORC with Senior-Gen .
Than Shwe as chairman , who also holds the post of Prime Minister and Minister of Defense , Gen. Maung Aye as Vice-Chairman , Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt as First Secretary and Lt. Gen. Tin Oo as Second Secretary .
Third Secretary Lt. Gen. Win Myint was added to the SPDC .
Both Lt. Gen. Tin Tun and Vice-Admiral Maung Maung Khin were also retained as Deputy Prime Ministers up to now .
Other members of the SPDC included those promoted from commanders of all military regions .
Of the 39-member cabinet , 16 were then newly appointed .
Some of them were promoted from regional commanders or deputy ministers .
Former senior cabinet ministers and a few former SLORC members were then placed in a 14-member Advisory Body to the SPDC .
The body , however , was abolished in less than a month .
Some of the 14 members were said to have been under investigation .
A major shift of military personnel was also carried out then from high-level leaders to regional commanders .
In the second reshuffle of the cabinet in December 1997 , eight ministers had their ministerial posts exchanged and a new Minister of Energy was appointed .
Observers here said the latest reshuffle comes in connection with the development of Myanmar 's political situation .
Whether these reshuffles could bring about some changes in the government 's policy remains to be seen , they said .
