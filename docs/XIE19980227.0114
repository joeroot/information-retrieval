HARBIN , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The first group of artificially bred Manchurian tigers currently being tamed for life in the wild are to be released to their natural habitat in heavily forested mountain areas in northeast China 's Heilongjiang Province by the year 2010 , conservationists here said today .
The effort will represent the first known attempt to return domesticated Manchurian tigers to the wild .
The pioneering program is considered to be of great importance for efforts to protect the endangered species , which is on the list of the top 10 rare animals on the verge of extinction worldwide .
Xinhua News Agency reporters visited the tiger-breeding base in the Lesser Xinggang Mountains in northeast China 's Heilongjiang Province .
There they saw how deer are released into the tigers ' compound to get the artificially raised tigers to learn how to hunt , an essential skill if they are to survive in their natural habitat .
Peter Jackson , a senior official from the World Conservation Union , who has paid two visits to the base , said that this is the best way to prepare the tigers for release into the wild .
The Manchurian tiger , which used to roam widely over northeast China and Siberia , lives mainly on deer and wild boars .
