DESPITE BIG SPENDING , RICH INVESTOR TRAILS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR 'S RACE
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By MARIA RECIO c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
WASHINGTON _ Sometimes , rich guys finish last .
In a bid to become the Democratic nominee for California governor , businessman Al Checchi has spent more than $ 30 million .
That 's more than anyone has ever spent in a nonpresidential race , political experts say .
And all of it is Checchi 's own money .
But after a fast start , Checchi may be poised to finish last in Tuesday 's primary election .
Although voters could still surprise the pollsters , the latest surveys show Checchi , who formerly worked in the investment operation of the Bass brothers of Fort Worth , losing ground in the three-way contest with Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and U.S. Rep. Jane Harman , D-Calif ..
In a poll released Thursday , Davis led with 27 percent of likely voters .
Harman had 14 percent , and Checchi , once the front-runner , had fallen to 13 percent .
The Field Institute poll of 714 voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .
`` The amateur hour is over in American politics , '' said Mark Mellman , a Democratic consultant who has monitored the California race .
He and other political analysts blame Checchi 's negative TV advertising , missteps and inexperience for his poor showing .
Checchi is a political neophyte whose extensive business background as an investor has a Fort Worth connection .
From 1982 to 1986 , Checchi was a principal in the Bass Brothers Enterprises investment group , working closely with Richard Rainwater on the purchase of the Bass stake in the Walt Disney Co. The four Bass brothers no longer invest jointly , and Rainwater also went his separate way , but it was a fateful link for Checchi .
It was his Bass association that took him to Los Angeles to oversee the Disney investment .
He later struck out on his own as a deal-maker , and , in 1989 , he engineered the buyout of Northwest Airlines , for which he served as co-chairman until stepping down last year to run for governor .
Checchi 's investments left him with a $ 700 million fortune _ and a desire to do more .
`` I reject the ` old politics ' that says we have to be content with things as they are , '' Checchi said in the candidates ' first televised debate .
Checci 's high-profile entry into gubernatorial politics in November at first resonated with voters drawn to ads portraying an attractive , articulate newcomer .
But when the race with Harman and Davis tightened a few months ago , voters reacted against the harsh ads that Checchi unleashed against Harman .
`` The voters have turned away from Checchi , '' said Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll .
`` Most people say his advertising was unfair .
Forty-nine percent have an unfavorable opinion of him .
That 's quite a negative appraisal . ''
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe , a political analyst at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont , Calif. , said that Checchi 's money won him name recognition , but that enthusiasm for him faded quickly .
`` He came out of the block with 17 percent support from absolutely nowhere , '' Bebitch Jeffe said .
`` The perception is that Al Checchi has used his money to buy the election .
I don n't think there 's ever been a case when money can buy you an election . ''
Some experts see a `` reverse Perot '' effect .
Political inexperience and wealth helped Dallas billionaire Ross Perot become a presidential candidate , but they have become negatives for Checchi .
`` It 's probably Ross Perot who gave rich outsiders a bad name , '' Mellman said .
Checchi made public school education one of his top issues , then stumbled badly when asked whether he would send his three children to public schools .
`` Of course not , '' he told the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board .
`` Why would I do that ? ''
The answer enraged public school supporters , and he did not help himself with a lackluster performance in two debates with his opponents .
But the TV ads defined him .
`` People didn n't have anything else to go on , '' said Jack Pitney , an associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College .
`` He didn n't have a record , a public persona or a constituency . ''
With Harman suffering from Checchi 's attacks on her record , Davis , a traditional Democrat and a veteran of 23 years in state politics , jumped into the lead .
If he wins the primary , as expected , he will face California Attorney General Dan Lungren , the only Republican in the race who is also on the ballot in Tuesday 's open primary .
Checchi has , however , made his mark .
Larry Makinson , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , said Checci 's record-breaking spending of his own wealth `` is definitely in new territory . ''
