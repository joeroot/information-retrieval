Singapore Unveils Prudent Budget for 1998 - 99
SINGAPORE , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Singapore Government unveiled what was described by Singapore press as a prudent budget for fiscal 1998 - 99 on Friday against a climate of slower growth as the regional financial crisis continued to run its course .
Presenting the budget at Parliament on Friday afternoon , Finance Minister Richard Hu said that the government revenues would be stagnant and a tight lid would be kept on operational expenditures .
However , capital expenditures would be increased in the key areas of education , economic infrastructure and defense in order to invest for the long term .
Estimated revenue collection is about 30 billion Singapore dollars ( about 18.4 billion U.S. dollars ) , while operating and development expenditures are budgeted at 27 billion Singapore dollars ( about 16.56 billion U.S. dollars ) .
This would give an operating surplus of 2.7 billion Singapore dollars ( about 1.66 billion U.S. dollars ) which would allow the government to add to its reserves further , he said .
The Minister pointed out that the regional crisis had clearly demonstrated the importance of such reserves especially for a small and open economy like Singapore .
He also said that businesses and individuals must prepare themselves for a period of slower growth and uncertainty .
They must be ready to respond to unanticipated developments and not flinch from tough measures where warranted , he said .
He said the best approach is to acknowledge the realities of the situation , however adverse they might be .
" It will show to investors our preparedness to tackle problems directly instead of evading them , " the Minister emphasized .
This would add to confidence in Singaporeans and in Singapore , he said .
