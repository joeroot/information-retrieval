` THE SLEEPING BEAUTY ' : APPEALING , BUT NOT TO RESTLESS YOUNGSTERS
( js ) By JACK ANDERSON c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ Although most children surely know the story of `` The Sleeping Beauty , '' the great ballet of that title is , at least in its complete form , essentially for grown-ups .
Just as long , rhapsodic speeches in a poetic drama may delight adult ears but make children restless , so the many beautiful solo variations of `` The Sleeping Beauty '' may tax young dancegoers ' attention spans .
To please audiences of all ages , American Ballet Theater presented two versions of `` The Sleeping Beauty '' on Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House .
In the evening , when Charles Barker conducted , the production was danced in its entirety by a cast that emphasized its choreographic glories .
With her speedy leaps and turns and her unshakable balances , Nina Ananiashvili was a confident Princess Aurora whose movements possessed such clarity that they shone with diamantine brilliance .
Julio Bocca turned Prince Desire into an ardent hero .
He and Ms. Ananiashvili were in total harmony in a grandly scaled wedding pas de deux that became a dance of triumph .
Julie Kent , a tender Aurora in an earlier performance , looked equally sweet as the Lilac Fairy .
And Martha Butler and Ethan Stiefel offered a buoyant Blue Bird Pas de Deux .
The afternoon performance , billed as a special family matinee , offered an abridged `` Sleeping Beauty , '' conducted by Jack Everly , that might well have stimulated youngsters ' imaginations without taxing their patience .
All the fairy variations were omitted except for the Lilac Fairy 's solo , which was warmly danced by Christina Fagundes .
Only the adagio of the Blue Bird Pas de Deux was included , pleasantly performed by Ekaterina Shelkanova and Giuseppe Picone , and the entire hunting scene was left out .
Paloma Herrera made Aurora a quick and eager young princess .
But she also became appealingly wistful in the vision scene .
Maxim Belotserkovsky was a gallant prince .
And Michael Owen was icily haughty as the evil Carabosse .
Some little girls in the audience dressed for the occasion , wearing crowns on their heads and carrying magic wands in their hands .
Others brought dolls and teddy bears to the theater .
Everyone ought to have had a good time .
