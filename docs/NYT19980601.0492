( Kansas City , Mo. : vision of many issues .
He is a person of intellect who outworks most people in his chosen field . '' )
That is not to say that Hayes is tied to the office .
He is in his executive office in downtown Topeka about half the time .
He also gives speeches , attends industry gatherings and serves on a variety of boards .
He is chairman of Rockhurst College 's board of trustees and the board of the Menninger Foundation .
Walter Menninger , chief executive of the Menninger Foundation in Topeka , said Hayes was very efficient .
`` Things happen where he is , '' Menninger said .
Hayes , a native of Kansas City , grew up in Shawnee .
At Rockhurst College , he majored in English and edited the school newspaper .
Hayes said that he was destined for law school but that a couple of auto wrecks while he was working as a night watchman left him financially strapped .
He scrapped plans for law and joined Southwestern Bell in 1959 , when it was part of a national monopoly .
Hayes made it to the presidency of the phone company , but was disappointed when he didn n't get the chairman 's job at the company 's parent Southwestern Bell Corp. , now SBC Communications .
The job went to Texan Edward Whitacre Jr.
Zane E. Barnes , Whitacre 's predecessor , said of Hayes , `` He is a pretty astute businessman , and he is a very good personality . ''
While Southwestern Bell president , Hayes kept his distance from the news media , something he later attributed to the company 's regimented corporate culture .
After he arrived at Western in 1989 , a seemingly more relaxed Hayes bantered privately with reporters about big deals in the works _ without ever disclosing details before public announcements were carefully orchestrated .
Successful utility executives inevitably become perceived as `` very important individuals , '' said Keith Bailey , chairman of the Williams Cos. , which has transported gas for Western .
`` He 's been involved in the kind of company _ I don n't know if ` deified ' is the right word _ that tends to push their corporate leadership on to pedestals , '' Bailey said .
Although Western and the Williams Cos. have clashed over business matters , Bailey is high on Hayes .
The two men have attended KU basketball games together .
`` He can Rock Chalk with the best of them , '' Bailey said of Hayes .
Jim Haines has witnessed a sensitive side of Hayes .
Haines , president of El Paso Electric Co. , was an executive at Kansas Gas when it was acquired by Western .
He recalls a hectic Sunday , after Western announced its deal to acquire Kansas Gas .
Hayes noticed some customer service workers at the Wichita utility and introduced himself .
`` It was a very little thing , '' Haines said .
`` I dare say , most people in the situation Hayes was in wouldn n't have thought to do that . ''
Haines worked for Hayes as Western 's chief operating officer before moving to El Paso .
Like other former Hayes proteges , he considers Hayes a mentor .
`` I worked for him for four years , '' Haines said .
`` The concern he had for taking care of customers is the most significant business lesson I learned from him . ''
Hayes said that as he ends his business career , he is still interested in making a contribution .
`` I am concerned about the same things most Americans are concerned about , '' he said .
`` Americans are concerned about the fabric of society , the direction we 're going in education . ''
But he does not share the view that overpaid , spoiled sports stars are a serious problem .
`` There are so many positive role models in sports , '' he said .
`` We forget Ty Cobb wasn n't such a positive role model .
So many people in sports get involved in the community . ''
That , too , is Hayes ' ambition .
In years to come , he and his wife , Gene , want to spend more time with their family , children Michele , John , Bryan and Joe _ all University of Kansas graduates _ as well as get away to be with family in Florida .
But Hayes isn n't ready to be enshrined in some corporate hall of fame .
`` I 'll stay involved , '' he said .
