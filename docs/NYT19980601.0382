ONE FALSE NOTE IN THE LIFE OF JAZZ MUSICIAN TIPTON
( js ) By DINITIA SMITH c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
On the morning of Jan. 21 , 1989 , Billy Tipton , 74 , a gifted jazz musician who was a veteran of the tiny clubs and VFW posts of small-town America , collapsed on the floor of a mobile home in Spokane , Wash. Tipton 's son William summoned paramedics , and as they opened Tipton 's pajamas to perform resuscitation , they made an extraordinary discovery .
Tipton , who most people had assumed to be a man , who had had at least five wives and had adopted three sons , was in fact a woman .
`` Did your father ever have a sex change ? ''
the paramedics asked William , he later recalled .
The news that Tipton , a pianist and saxophonist , was a woman came as a shock to nearly everyone , including the women who had considered themselves his wives , as well as his sons and the musicians who had traveled with him .
And the story has intrigued writers and composers ever since .
The figure of Billy Tipton has become an emblem for the current fascination with gender , manifest in films like `` The Crying Game , '' the play `` M. Butterfly , '' and in the burgeoning academic field of `` queer theory , '' which is entirely devoted to the subject of sexual identity .
Tipton 's life has inspired an opera , `` Billy , '' with music by Timothy Brock and a libretto by Brian Willis ; a play , `` Stevie Wants to Play the Blues , '' by Eduardo Machado , and a jazz musical , `` The Slow Drag , '' by Carson Kreitzer , which was performed off-Broadway in 1996 .
It was also featured in a theatrical revue , `` The Opposite Sex Is Neither , '' by Kate Bornstein , a woman who used to be a man .
In Seattle , a group of feminist jazz musicians founded the Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet .
Now a biography , `` Suits Me : The Double Life of Billy Tipton , '' has been written by literary scholar Diane Middlebrook , a Stanford University professor best known for her biography of the poet Anne Sexton .
That book was criticized in some circles for incorporating transcripts of tape recordings of Sexton 's sessions with her psychiatrist .
Part of the fascination of Tipton 's story is in the window it provides on the world of jazz in the '30s , '40s and '50s , when popular tastes in music had been honed by radio , and jazz could be found in almost every town in America .
With a few exceptions , like Hazel Scott , jazz was a man 's world .
Whether simply as a matter of sexual choice or to get work in jazz , Tipton lived the life of a man .
She was an acute observer of male and female style , and such a successful mimic , that she seems to have been able to deceive even those with whom she had the most intimate contact .
For Ms. Middlebrook , Tipton was a case study in the essentially fluid boundaries of human sexuality .
The subject provided an opportunity to explore the question of how much of what is called male and female is the result of biology , and how much is the result of a performance , acted according to cultural norms .
`` She was a great performer , '' Ms. Middlebrook said in a recent interview .
`` I don n't think she thought she was born in the wrong body .
That 's a contemporary narrative .
She 's not a lesbian , because the women she was with didn n't know she was female .
She occupied an undefinable space .
She was someone who worked creatively in the gap between biology and gender . ''
Throughout history , of course , women have assumed male disguises for economic and social reasons .
During the Civil War , Ms. Middlebrook notes , an estimated 400 cross-dressing women posed as men and served in the Union Army .
George Sand and Colette both wore men 's clothes .
James Barry , a doctor who lived from 1795 to 1863 , and who is credited with performing the first successful Caesarean section , was assumed to be a man until her death , when her true identity was revealed .
`` Billy Tipton literally became a poster boy for raising consciousness about the confusion of sex ( biological ) and gender ( culturally meaningful physical and social attributes ) , '' Ms. Middlebrook writes .
`` Billy 's story lets us watch one woman 's bold solutions to gaining a certain amount of recognition in what was largely a man 's world . ''
Billy Tipton was born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in Oklahoma City and grew up in Kansas City , Mo. , a center of jazz .
Dorothy came from a prosperous family .
Her father , George , was an aviator , and her mother , Reggie , to whom she was close , was beautiful and glamorous .
Dorothy was musically talented and studied organ , piano and saxophone in school .
Ms. Middlebrook 's interviews with members of Tipton 's family revealed that the cross-dressing began when Dorothy tried to find a job as a jazz musician .
Indeed , said Leslie Gourse , author of `` Madame Jazz , '' a book about female jazz musicians , `` There was an unwritten code in the jazz world , that women just didn n't get hired . ''
To pass as a man , Dorothy bound her breasts with Ace bandages and wore a prosthetic device .
Later , she would tell people that she wore the bandages because of a childhood accident in which her ribs were broken .
Tipton , who had a tenor voice , eventually joined a group called the Banner Cavaliers , and obtained a Social Security card as a man .

Early in her career , in late 1938 , she played with Wayne Benson , a bass player .
`` She looked like a young boy , '' Benson said in an interview .
`` She was acting like a boy .
No one said anything , but as far as I was concerned , she was a woman .
I was surprised by their surprise when she died and they found out . ''
Ms. Middlebrook 's book is a glimpse into the mass culture of the period .
One of Tipton 's first girlfriends was Non Earl Harrell , 14 years her senior and a star of the marathon dance contests popular at the time .
By most accounts , women found Tipton gentle , affectionate and kind .
And she in turn preferred women who were somewhat self-involved .
`` She chose people who don n't pay attention to other people , '' said Ms. Middlebrook .
`` People who don n't notice things .
She was also able to create a feeling of intimacy without attracting notice . ''
In 1946 , Tipton met a shy , pretty 18-year-old , Betty Cox , and they lived together as man and wife .
`` He was a great performer , '' Ms. Cox said in a recent telephone interview .
`` He had a neat voice , and was very personable . ''
They had a sexual relationship , Ms. Cox said .
But still , she said , she didn n't know Tipton was a woman .
She came from a sheltered background where sex was never discussed .
`` Women didn n't go around undressed , '' said Ms. Cox .
`` You wore a robe .
You didn n't leave the lights on when you had sex . ''
At one point , she and Tipton tried to conceive a child , Ms. Cox said , but she believed she had suffered a miscarriage .
Ms. Cox accompanied Tipton on the road , but she eventually tired of it , and after seven years together , the two broke up .
`` I wanted to go back home ; that was the end of it , '' said Ms. Cox , who went on to marry and have five children .
In 1951 , Tipton formed the Billy Tip Tipton Trio .
As leader , she slicked back her hair and wore a white dinner jacket .
The group 's style was reminiscent of Benny Goodman 's trio and quartet .
It played hits including `` Exactly Like You , '' `` All of Me , '' `` The Way You Look Tonight '' and `` It 's Only a Paper Moon '' and recorded two albums , `` Sweet Georgia Brown '' and `` Billy Tipton Plays Hi-Fi on Piano . ''
`` I had no idea he was a woman , '' said Kenny Richards , who played bass and sang with the trio .
`` I didn n't know until he died . ''
In 1958 Tipton had a chance to break into the big time when the group was offered a recording contract and a gig opening for Liberace in Reno , Nev. , at more than double its usual fee .
But Tipton said no. One reason he turned down the chance , Ms. Middlebrook theorizes , is that bigger exposure might have revealed who Tipton truly was .
Tipton settled in Spokane , Wash. , continuing to play jazz , and working as a booker in a theatrical agency .
There he met Kitty Kelly , a stripper known as `` the Irish Venus . ''
In a letter to Ms. Kelly , Tipton called her `` a wonderful person , decent and honest . ''
In another , she wrote : `` I love you with everything that is in me , and I only hope that I can make you happy for the rest of my life . ''
Ms. Kelly and Tipton settled down together .
Now married and known as Kitty Oakes , she said she never knew that Tipton was a woman .
Ms. Oakes said she had an illness that prevented her from having a sexual relationship with Tipton .
`` We didn n't share a room , '' she said . `` I was taught to judge the person head on , as they were .
Billy was funny , gentle as a human being .
We liked the same kind of music .
We liked each other . ''
And they both wanted children .
They went on to adopt three boys , John , Scott and William .
By all accounts , Tipton was an ideal father , a Scout master who loved to go on camping trips with his boys .
`` He was the only father I ever knew , '' William said recently .
`` He was there for us .
He didn n't go out and get drunk and beat on us .
`` We had a close relationship .
We would go to movies .
It was more like good buddies .
We went out to dinner , or we just sat and talked .
It never occurred to me he was a woman . ''
For many years , it was a happy family , Ms. Oakes said .
Tipton once told her in a letter : `` You are instilled so deep in my heart that you have become part of me .
It would be difficult to imagine life without you .
In our seven years together we have seen much hurt and much pain , both physical and mental , and we still cling to each other . ''
But as the boys reached adolescence , tensions began to emerge in the marriage .
Ms. Oakes said she felt that Tipton was not tough enough on them .
`` Billy , for whatever reason , couldn n't , or wouldn n't , control them , '' she said .
Finally , in 1981 , the couple separated , and the boys went to live with their father .
By now , Tipton was suffering from arthritis , emphysema and ulcers .
What Ms. Middlebrook calls his `` lifelong trait of avoidance '' had prevented him from going to a doctor .
Death finally came from a perforated ulcer .
After he died , it was left to his family to unravel the mystery of his life .
`` I know he wanted to tell me , '' said Ms. Oakes .
`` But he couldn n't say , ` I 'm tired , I 'm old , '' ' and tell her the truth .
`` Billy did a great Houdini , '' Ms. Oakes said , then laughed .
`` Instead of treating this as a grand deception , don n't you think it 's funny ? ''
Ms. Middlebrook writes : `` Billy demonstrated by her accomplishment that gender , unlike sex , is in large part a performance .
She was the actor , he was the role . ''
Before her death , Tipton had discarded all her sex-concealing gear , Ms. Middlebrook writes .
`` Billy had prepared to emerge from behind his screen like the Wizard of Oz , to dissolve the magic into wisdom , revealing by her nakedness in death that ` the difference ' between men and women is largely in the eye of the beholder . ''
