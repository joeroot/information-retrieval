PATRIOTS SEEKING CAMP FIRE
FBN-NFLNOTES-BOS ( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By Nick Cafardo c.1998 The Boston Globe
There 's little football activity at Foxboro Stadium these summer days , except for Patriots vice president of business operations Andy Wasynczuk trying to sign the team 's draft picks prior to the start of training camp at Smithfield , R.I . , July 19 .
Coaches have already devised their schedules for the camp , which will be run similar to last year .
Players will go through a morning workout and then a less intense afternoon practice without pads .
There may be more times this year than last when players will wear pads during both sessions , because Pete Carroll and the assistant coaches want to get a better reading on key unproven players such as Robert Edwards , the running back-elect ; highly touted Tebucky Jones , who is supposed to be an aggressive bump-and-run corner , and Tony Gaiter , the young potential kick and punt returner who looks great in the no-pad minicamps , but has to prove he can play when the going gets tougher .
But the main focus of the camp will be on four areas : finding a No. 1 running back ; watching Terry Glenn 's attempt to replicate his rookie season of 1996 ; Jones 's attempt to make the conversion to corner after one year of playing strong safety at Syracuse , and finding a big-play replacement for Dave Meggett .
It is these questions that have some prognosticators already predicting the Patriots to finish as low as third in the AFC East , behind Miami and New York .
They see that the team lost Curtis Martin to the Jets and are now in the process of having to rely on Edwards , their No. 1 pick from the University of Georgia , or second-year player Sedrick Shaw , a third-rounder from Iowa .
The Patriots ' brass liked what they saw of Edwards at the minicamps , but all agreed that the assessment was hollow considering Edwards wasn n't in pads , and no 260-pound middle linebacker was hitting him head-on or attempting to strip the ball .
The knock on Edwards is that he is fumble-prone and a bit injury-prone .
Those were the same two knocks on third-round pick Martin , when he came out of the University of Pittsburgh four years ago .
The Patriots are realistic about what Edwards can give them .
They don n't expect a 1,400-yard season , but they do expect enough production to give them at least the threat of a running game to take some of the pressure off Drew Bledsoe .
`` If we have to get it from two or three guys , we 'll do it that way , '' said Carroll .
Does he really mean that ?
Probably not .
He 'd love for Edwards to take the job , become the AFC 's rookie of the year , and make everyone forget Martin .
While the experts and Patriots fans fret about the loss of Martin , it 's these same fans that often lamented that the Patriots didn n't have an effective running game with Martin .
On third and short , the Patriots often had to put the football in the air because Martin , who preferred the East-West style , was stuffed at the line of scrimmage .
Now they hope they can run the ball in third-and-2 situations .
One positive about Edwards , who is more of a downfield runner than Martin , is that the offensive line may improve its run-blocking simply because they know where Edwards is going .
The line took a major rap last season because it wasn n't opening the holes for Martin .
But the blockers quietly asked , `` Where was Curtis going ? ''
Offensive line coach Paul Boudreau , who coached the Detroit Lions ' offensive line in the Barry Sanders era , understood this type of running , but he was never able to institute a proper blocking scheme .
`` With an East-West runner , it 's very difficult , '' said Boudreau .
`` You have to block as you normally would and hope the runner is given enough space to make something happen .
We 're going to do things the same way this year .
We really don n't know who the runner is going to be _ and it may be more than one _ so instead of playing a guessing game , we 're just going to do what we do best . ''
As for Glenn , the receiver said he has made more of a commitment to conditioning this offseason , which hopefully can help him avoid the multiple injuries he suffered in ' 97 that drastically reduced his playing time and cut his productivity from 90 receptions his rookie year to 27 last year .
But whether he was committed enough is the question .
Reading between the lines on comments by both strength coach Johnny Parker and Carroll , it appears they weren n't completely convinced of the receiver 's new-found dedication .
After a year of lamenting his loss , Carroll isn n't using Glenn as an excuse anymore .
`` It 's up to Terry , '' said Carroll .
`` It 's whatever Terry can give us .
I think he knows how we feel about what he means to this team , and now he has to show what he can do . ''
With Glenn 's status up in the air , the Patriots are having a renewed fondness for Vincent Brisby .
Once a favorite target of Bledsoe , Brisby 's injury problems and a seeming lack of interest in playing had the team thinking of releasing him and his $ 1.2 million contract .
Brisby even demanded a trade this offseason , but the Patriots were asking for a second-round draft pick in return and nothing transpired .
But the 6-foot-3-inch Brisby is the big receiver that new offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese likes in his system .
Brisby reminds him of Michael Irvin .
And so with Glenn , Shawn Jefferson , Brisby , Troy Brown , and Brian Stablein , as well as second-round pick Tony Simmons , a speedster from Wisconsin , the Patriots feel they have enough depth at the receiver position .
The right corner position is the only spot on the defensive side of the ball in question , and that 's where Jones comes in .
Carroll , whose expertise is the secondary , likes his defensive backs big and physical , and at 6 - 2 , 220 pounds , Jones fills the bill .
The Patriots feel so strongly about Jones they dealt last year 's starter , Jimmy Hitchcock , to the Minnesota Vikings for a third-round draft pick .
Carroll is also hoping last year 's No. 1 pick , Chris Canty , finally takes the job seriously and can challenge Jones , or at least be an adequate backup .
Carroll also has veteran Steve Israel if Jones isn n't quite ready .
Then , there 's the task of replacing Meggett .
Meggett 's value was that he never fumbled .
He always ran up to catch a punt and never left his team in poor field position , all traits of a great returner .
He had been slowing as a kick returner , and Derrick Cullors stepped in and exceled last season .
On punts , Carroll is giving the job to Brown , who had been Meggett 's sidekick on returns for two years before Brown was re-assigned as Glenn 's replacement .
In their dream of dreams , the Patriots would love Gaiter , a second-year player out of Miami , to emerge .
Gaiter , 5 - 8 , 170 pounds , is the quickest player on the roster and he has unbelievable moves .
The team will likely sign Terry Kirby , or a similar-type player before training camp , to give them a good third-down back who can catch .
This camp will also be more of a showcase for the sophomore players .
The Patriots would like to demonstrate that the ' 96 draft wasn n't the bust some experts think it was .
Offensive linemen Ed Ellis , Scott Rehberg , and Damon Denson will receive significant playing time .
Second-round pick Brandon Mitchell will get to compete with Mark Wheeler for a starting job in the interior defensive line .
Shaw will get to take snaps with the first team and hope to prove his stock as a third-round pick .
And Canty , who had two excellent minicamps , is hoping to show he can cover big-time receivers in the NFL .
And also watch former Northeastern quarterback Jim Murphy .
They love his attitude and leadership skills .
If Murphy is someone they can work with in the future , Tom Tupa may be able to escape third-quarterback duties and become a full-time punter .
Gash makes mark
No surprise dept. : Sam Gash has already made an instant impact with the Bills .
The players love him , and he 's already considered a team leader .
.
.
Another interesting story in Buffalo is the play of free agent Rene Ingoglia .
The three-time Division 1-AA All-American , a 5 - 11 , 211-pound running back from the University of Massachusetts , took snaps with the Bills ' second team and even took snaps with Antowain Smith and the first unit .
.
.
There have been some conversations between agent Leigh Steinberg and the Cincinnati Bengals concerning Neil O ' Donnell , recently released by the Jets .
The Bengals were talking to Vinny Testaverde , but the Brown family nixed a deal and he signed with the Jets .
The Bengals appear OK at QB with Jeff Blake and Paul Justin competing for the top job .
.
.
Jerry Rice still doesn n't second-guess his decision to return to the 49 ers as quickly as he did last season , when he broke his kneecap in his first game back .
`` I felt that I had done every thing I could to come back , '' said Rice .
`` I felt great .
I felt strong . ''

Darren Flutie had thoughts of quitting football and devoting his time to his real job at Read Sand and Gravel in Rockland , but he decided to move to Hamilton , Ontario , and play in the Canadian Football League one more year for the $ 150,000 CFL maximum .
.
.
University of Texas running back Ricky Williams left the Philadelphia Phillies ' rookie team in Batavia of the New York-Penn League this week , but not because he 's giving up baseball .
Williams , who could easily be the next Deion Sanders , could be one of the top two or three players taken in next year 's NFL draft .
He was hitting . 288 at Batavia , but the center fielder and leadoff hitter had to return to Texas because strength coach Mac Brown prefers his players report for conditioning six weeks before training camp starts .
Williams , who is compared to Brian Jordan , an All-Pro corner with the Atlanta Falcons and now a superstar with the St. Louis Cardinals , may play both sports , but after the football season , he 'll sit down with his agents at Woolf Associates to make a decision .

Yes , that was Max Lane ( perhaps a two-sport guy himself ? ) throwing World Wrestling Federation announcer Dok Hendrix off the dock and into the chilly Charles River outside the Cambridgeside Galleria last Wednesday .
The WWF boys were in town to promote `` Footbrawl , '' an event to benefit the Patriots ' charitable foundation that will be held at Foxboro Stadium Aug. 8.
The Cambridge event was an arm wrestling competition between WWF owner Vince McMahon and WWF champ `` Stone Cold '' Steve Austin .
.
.
Bledsoe started the Drew Bledsoe Foundation two years ago and runs it with his father , Mac .
The foundation basically emphasizes a parenting with dignity program .
`` We 've put together some videotapes to help teach parents to communicate more effectively with their children , '' said the younger Bledsoe .
`` Part of it is to teach their children values .
Some of the charities I 've been involved in are reactive rather than proactive .
If we can get into homes and families can watch the videos together , we feel we can solve a lot of problems before they occur .
It 's strange when you think that you go through 13 years of public school ( including kindergarten ) and nobody educates you on how to be a parent when really , there 's nothing more important in life than raising your children . ''
.
.
.
Aren n't you looking forward to the first collision between Ted Johnson and Martin in the open field ?
Martin gave another boring interview on ESPN 's `` Up Close '' last week .
Yes , among other things , Martin said he 'll be at `` 120 percent '' for the upcoming season .
Sounds like a prime candidate for John Dennis 's Media Wise .
.
.
Patriot rookies attended the NFL 's orientation program in Denver last week .
That 's where young players learn about life in the NFL and how to act on and off the field .
Two of a kind ?
Hardly
Never thought we 'd link Bill Walsh and Lawrence Phillips , but there 's a first time for everything .
Both used the `` Do you know who I am ? ''
line in separate incidents last week .
Phillips allegedly used it a Plantation , Fla. , nightclub when he was accused of punching a woman who refused to dance with him .
And Walsh used it before he was punched in the mouth at a Lake Tahoe casino by a man who thought Walsh was peaking at a face-down card while he was playing blackjack .
Walsh suffered a swollen lip .
He will recover , but Phillips has some explaining to do .
He 's now been involved in four incidents in his two years in the NFL , and he may be wearing out his welcome in Miami , where even Jimmy Johnson , who tolerates a lot of nonsense , might have had enough .
.

Brett Favre is opening his second Brett Favre Steakhouse , in Green Bay in October .
Favre 's restaurant in Milwaukee has been a huge success .
The new place is located on Brett Favre Path in Green Bay and will feature a souvenir shop .
.
.
Word is that former Boston College quarterback Glenn Foley is in great shape and more than ready for any challenge Testaverde may give him in Jets camp .
Foley wants to end all of the constant references to his fragility .
.
.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers keep getting more and more athletic .
This week they added to their already-deep running game by picking up Leeland McElroy on waivers from the Arizona Cardinals .
McElroy , the 32 d player taken in the 1996 draft , became expendable when the Cardinals picked up Adrian Murrell in a deal with the Jets .
McElroy gained 729 yards on 224 carries last year and he 's also a decent kick returner .
.
.
The Chiefs signed their No. 1 pick , offensive tackle Victor Riley , to a five-year deal .
The Chiefs have had problems getting their No. 1 picks into camp on time .
Last year , tight end Tony Gonzalez missed 10 days , and two years ago , Jerome Woods missed 19 days .
.
.
Go figure dept : Last year Rocket Ismail turned down $ 1.2 million from Jacksonville because he wanted to go to Carolina .
He signed for $ 900 , 000 .
This offseason he drew interest from Philadelphia and Chicago .
He wouldn n't talk to Chicago and never really considered Philadelphia , because he wanted to return to Carolina .
He re-signed for $ 400,000 and insisted he 'll earn incentives that could bring him to $ 1.2 million .
And he 's happy as a clam .
.
.
Wonder how the Krafts feel about music promoter Don Law saying he 'll relocate Harborlights to the waterfront property in South Boston they couldn n't use to build a stadium ?
Can n't wait to hear Tom Menino and Stephen Lynch explain this one .
