California to Get Government Funds For El Nino Relief
LOS ANGELES , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. government will allocate an estimated 250 million U.S. dollars to California to compensate the damage caused by El Nino , said officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency Thursday .
Twenty million dollars of the funds will be used to help repair highways and buildings torn up by rain and mud slides , said James Lee Witt , director of the agency , who is making a survey into the disaster .
The El Nino resulted in serious storms , floods and mudslides in the state , having brought about approximately 500 million dollars worth of property damage since the beginning of the year .
President Bill Clinton is now in California meeting with local officials and citizens to discuss recovering efforts .
The National Weather Service said that , in the first 24 days of February , the Los Angeles civic center received 13.38 inches of rain , the most since records started being kept in 1877 .
San Francisco is experiencing the wettest winter in this century with a total rainfall of 38.48 inches received during this season .
El Nino has already been blamed for 90 deaths across the United States since the beginning of this year .
Joe Friday , chief analyst in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , said this figure surpasses the death toll in the 1982 - 83 El Nino , which had been the strongest one ever studied .
Forecasters have warned that the El Nino weather phenomenon will continue raging through late spring .
" El Nino will remain the same for the next two to three months at least , " said Vernon Kousky , another senior chief analyst in NOAA , adding that it was impossible to tell if the worst was over or if even more violent weather is on the way .
