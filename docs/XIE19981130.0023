Report : U.S. Navy to Expand Antimissile Development
WASHINGTON , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The U.S. Navy is to construct the first reliable medium-range antimissile shield , turning its fleet of cruisers and destroyers into platform for launching high-altitude interceptors , the Washington Post reported Monday .
A high-level Pentagon panel that authorizes major defense acquisition programs is soon to approve the Navy 's concept for an expanded antimissile program , the Post said .
It noted that the move comes in the wake of a faltering 14 billion dollars Army program that has encountered quality-control problems and five consecutive intercept test failures .
But the Navy 's project is less tested than the Army option and actual intercept flight tests will not begin until 2000 , putting the service on a tight schedule to meet the Pentagon 's goal of developing a system with at least modest capability of shooting down incoming ballistic missiles by 2005 .
The earliest version of the Navy system is designed to shoot down missiles that have ranges of 600 to 800 miles ( 1100 - 1500 km ) .
With Congress pressing for faster development of U.S. antimissile defenses , the Navy already has spent 1.1 billion U.S. dollars in perfecting the concept for its Theater Wide system since 1995 .
The Pentagon 's five-year budget provides another 1.5 billion dollars for the program , but the Navy believes that the amount could be doubled to meet the 2005 target date .
