Indonesian Shuttler Accepts IBF 's Doping Decision
The 22-year-old shuttler was banned after the anabolic steroid Nandrolone was found in his urine samples taken at the Singapore Open in August , a competition he won .
" Thank God because I will only serve half the usual sentence .
I feel relieved and pleaded with the PBSI 's ( Badminton Association of Indonesia ) efforts during the hearing last week , " Sigit was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying .
An emotional Sigit also thanked his parents for their encouragement despite the blot that now tarnishes his illustrious career .
" They have been prepared for such a bitter decision , and yet they still give me their full confidence , " he said at the national badminton center in East Jakarta .
PBSI vice chairman Agus Wirahadikusumah said on Tuesday the association would file an appeal to have Sigit 's punishment cut to six months .
" I don n't know about the plan to appeal .
But if the association wants to do that , I can only support it , " said Sigit , whose suspension runs until November 15 .
Sigit said he was considering taking English and computer courses while serving the punishment .
He said he did not think he would lose his brilliance during his enforced layoff .
" I 'm practicing with world-class players like Ricky ( Subagja ) and Rexy ( Mainaky ) , Candra and Tony ( Gunawan ) or Antonius and Denny ( Kantono ) .
I 'm sure I won n't miss anything during the next year , " Sigit said .
Meanwhile , the head of the badminton center Christian Hadinata hinted men 's singles player Marlev Mainaky could miss the Asiad due to a knee injury .
Marlev complained about his pain long before he made a defense of his Indonesia Open title last month .
He crashed to compatriot Budi Santoso in the quarterfinals .
