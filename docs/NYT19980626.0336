RED SOX AWAIT FEASIBLITY STUDY FOR NEW FENWAY
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By WILL MCDONOUGH c.1998 The Boston Globe
The Red Sox have a plan for a new stadium .
But it is not The Plan for a new stadium , and whether it becomes a reality has not been determined .
The Sox are awaiting a final report from Arthur Andersen , the nationally prominent consulting company , on the economic feasibility of a new Fenway Park .
In other words , if the Andersen report says the Sox can use their own money to build it and still make a profit , that 's what the team will do .
Right now the Sox are looking at the parcel of land that runs along Boylston Street from Yawkey Way , where the present park is located , west toward the Fenway .
Andersen has been chosen to decide if fans in this area will support a new stadium with a capacity of 45,000 by purchasing expensive luxury boxes , preferred seating , and more expensive seats overall .
The plan the Sox are hoping for has several stages .
They would build a new park while playing in the present park .
When the new park is finished , they would tear down the old one and develop that land to generate money to fund the new facility .
It will probably be closer to the end of the season before the Red Sox have a press conference to detail the plan and what help they hope to get from the city of Boston .

Look for Dave Meggett to file a lawsuit against the Patriots and their doctors .
Meggett will claim that his injury _ a broken bone in his foot suffered in the final playoff game at Pittsburgh _ was misdiagnosed , which is why he was walking around on it for several months before the problem was discovered .
Meggett will also file an injury grievance against the team for releasing him when he was injured .
Under NFL rules , the most he can get for the injury grievance is $ 200 , 000 .
Reportedly , the reason authorities in Toronto dropped sexual assault charges against Meggett was that there were no bruises or marks on the alleged victim , according to the physicians who examined her .
If the Toronto police go forward with a robbery charge against him , Meggett 's defense will be that the woman tried to rob him and that he caught her trying to go out the door of her hotel room with his wallet and watch , which he then recovered .

This is the kind of guy Payne Stewart is .
The day after his heartbreaking final-round loss to Lee Janzen in the US Open , he showed up for a charity tournament staged by his friend D.A .
Weibring .
Stewart had every reason to beg off but didn n't .
He told a close friend that his only regret when he lost a four-shot lead in the final round of the Open Sunday was that he did not ask for a ground-under-repair ruling on the 12th hole .
Stewart hit his drive into the fairway , but it rolled into a divot filled with sand and stopped .
He played the shot from there , hitting it into a bunker , and failed to get up and down for par .
Stewart reportedly feels now that since the divot had been repaired by putting sand in it , the ruling could have been that it was ground under repair , and in that case , he would have been allowed to take a free drop .
Stewart says he would have rather hit the ball out of the divot with no sand in it than out of sand of uncertain depth .

Mark McGwire is not doing Mo Vaughn any favors .
McGwire is playing for $ 9.5 million annually on a new three-year contract .
Vaughn initially told the Sox last fall that he would accept a contract in the McGwire range .
That was before McGwire signed .
The Sox offered Vaughn $ 10 million annually for three years , and he turned it down when they signed Pedro Martinez for more .
Vaughn is a first baseman .
McGwire is a first baseman .
Frank Thomas of the White Sox , who has had a better career than Mo , is making $ 10 million annually on a six-year contract , and he 's a first baseman .
All the so-called big-market teams have first basemen who are good and making big money .

A few weeks back , Nancy Bachard of Haydenville , Mass. was riding by the local golf course when she heard a thump .
She didn n't pay attention to the noise until she got home and found damage to her car .
Bachard returned to the course and found the owner talking with golfer Todd Obuchowski of Northampton , who said he hit a shot on a par 3 onto Route 9 , only to have it bounce back onto the green and into the cup for a hole-in-one .
Bachard verified that her car had been hit .
Obuchowski achieved some fame when his story was sent around the country by the Associated Press , but as of last week , Bachard was still waiting to collect the $ 231 to repair the damage to her car .

Here are some reasons that Bill Parcells opted to sign the well-traveled Vinny Testaverde to a Jets contract this week .
When Parcells made the playoffs in his second year with the Patriots , Testaverde completed 20 of 30 passes for 268 yards , with a touchdown and no first downs , and three times ran for first downs , including a 36-yard gain , as he led the Cleveland Browns past New England , 20 - 13 , in a 1994 wild-card game .
In ' 96 , when he was playing for Baltimore , Testaverde threw for 353 yards and three touchdowns , completing 29 of 45 passes , though the Patriots hung on to beat the Ravens , 46 - 38 .
This was the game that cost Jimmy Hitchcock his starting cornerback 's job for the rest of the Parcells regime .
Then last year in Giants Stadium , Testaverde threw a touchdown pass in the closing moments to tie the game against Parcells 's Jets and send it into overtime , where New York won on a field goal .
Whenever someone mentioned Testaverde 's name around Parcells , his response would almost always be , `` The kid scares me to death . ''
Parcells told Testaverde that Glenn Foley will be his starting quarterback , but if he falters or Testaverde outplays him in the exhibition season , Vinny will be No. 1.
Parcells never liked Neil O ' Donnell and saved $ 2.5 million under the salary cap by getting rid of him .

The buzz this week was that Michael Jordan soon will announce his retirement from basketball .
However , someone who knows him well says that even if Jordan were going to retire , he would not do so now .
The odds weigh heavily in favor of a lockout in the NBA starting Wednesday , and smart people think it will run a month into the season .
If Jordan quits before July 1 , the Bulls would be able to use his salary to sign a bunch of new players .
Jordan won n't let that happen .
His public promise not to return to Chicago if Phil Jackson did not return as coach has been rescinded .
Reportedly , Jordan told owner Jerry Reinsdorf that if Jackson left on his own ( which he did ) , then Jordan would come back if Scottie Pippen came back .
The Bulls reportdly are ready to offer Pippen $ 40 million over two years .
However , Phoenix may come after him with $ 60 million for four years .
Does Pippen take the $ 40 mil and hope his body holds out or take the $ 60 mil , which he would get no matter what ?
The guessing is that he will take the $ 60 mil .

Larry Kennan , who was demoted as Patriots offensive coordinator and later quit as an offensive assistant , obviously is well regarded by his colleagues around the NFL .
Kennan has been named the first president of the NFL Coaches Association , which means he will oversee some delicate negotations with the league office in the coming months .
The NFL assistants get dumped on by the league , and have been for years .
The word is that if they don n't get a better deal in terms of benefits and pension on paper within a year , they will officially become a unit and hook up with the Players Association , which the owners do not want to happen ...
Who ever thought we would see the day when not a single American tennis player is ranked in the top 12 money winners in the world going into Wimbledon ?
Andre Agassi , the top US earner , was 13th ...
Why doesn n't anyone ever mention Brian Jordan of the St. Louis Cardinals , one of the best dual athletes ever ?
Jordan was a terrific safety when he played for the Atlanta Falcons , making the Pro Bowl one year as a special teams player .
Now he leads the National League in hitting .
Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders never came close to hitting the ball as consistently as Jordan has this year ...
The most unappreciated couple ever to grace Boston were the Yawkeys .
To this point , the two charitable foundations left by Tom and Jean have produced $ 27 million , with most of that going to the needy in the Greater Boston area ...
Harvard 's baseball team finished 24th in the final collegiate rankings .
The last time an Ivy League team ranked that high probably was before World War II .
