Australia Delays Analogue Mobile Phone Phase-out
CANBERRA , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Analogue mobile phone owners in Australia will have up to an extra 12 months of service after their government and the country 's major mobile phone carriers Telstra , Optus and Vodafone agreed to extend the phase-out period .
Instead of cutting out on January 1 , 2000 , the last of the 400 base stations will close by December 31 , 2000 , Australian Communications Minister Richard Alston said Monday .
The analogue service will be replaced with digital service , which is superior .
" We 'll have digital technology , which is clearly superior in every respect , " the minister told reporters .
Arrangements for the analogue phase-out in metropolitan Australia remained unchanged , with services ceasing on December 31 , 1999 , replaced entirely by the existing GMS digital service .
