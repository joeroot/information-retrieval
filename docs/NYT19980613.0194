PATRIOTS WILL RUN ON FRESH LEGS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By NICK CAFARDO c.1998 The Boston Globe
& UR ; & LR ; The shadow of Bill Parcells lingers in New England .
Pete Carroll perhaps never will escape it , unless the Patriots win a Super Bowl .
But the shadow isn n't so annoying as Carroll enters his second year at the helm a year wiser and , one would assume , better-equipped to run the team .
Asked about the Parcells mystique , Carroll said , `` I knew coming into the job that it would always be there , and it 's there for people to bring up from time to time .
That 's fine .
It doesn n't bother me .
Bill Parcells is a great coach who has championship rings .
I don n't have any yet .
I don n't have that type of respect .
And I shouldn n't have it because if I did , I wouldn n't have earned it .
I don n't want something for nothing .
I 'm looking forward to getting it , and that 's what we 're trying to build here . ''
Then Keith Byars , now a New York Jet with Parcells , was right last week when he said , `` Pete 's a good coach , but he 's a work in progress . ''
Carroll heard the comment and wanted no part of a response , especially to an ex-player .
They 're gone and forgotten as far as Carroll is concerned .
Little by little , he has rid himself of the reminders of the former coach _ Byars , Dave Meggett , Sam Gash .
Curtis Martin was one , too , though Carroll never wished to lose the All-Pro runner .
For all the criticism Carroll and Bobby Grier receive for this , wouldn n't any coach want to bring in his own players ?
Why else would Parcells sign up so many ex-Patriots , just as he signed many ex-Giants when he was here ?
The Patriots are changing their face and acquiring players Carroll thinks will be more productive in the long run .
In the process , they are losing valuable experience and leadership _ some think too much of it .
Some preseason publications already have the Patriots third behind the Jets and Dolphins .
Looking at the team from afar , it 's easy to see why that 's so .
Martin , Meggett , Byars , and Gash are gone .
That 's an entire backfield , and the guys who would stand up and get others in line if things weren n't going well .
The motto now is : `` Young , fast , and strong . ''
That 's the type of team Carroll wants .
`` Hopefully , after we 've gone through training camp and we start the season , we 'll find that we 've upgraded the athleticism of this team , '' he said .
`` Our young guys are fast and strong .
You hate to lose leadership , but in the end it 's which team has the most talented players . ''
Young , fast , and strong .
`` This is Pete 's team , no question , '' said strong safety Lawyer Milloy .
`` Bill Parcells is gone .
The philosophy is different .
It 's changed .
It is what it is now .
It 's not like the Parcells days .
These are the Carroll days now . ''
Maybe that means kinder and gentler .
`` I like Coach Carroll 's approach , '' said first-round pick Tebucky Jones .
`` I played for coaches who were constantly screaming .
Pete is more laidback . ''
Some people hate to hear that .
They equate laidback with soft , with a coach who lets his players run the ship .
But Carroll gets his points across .
If you 're not willing to pay the price of being young , fast , and strong , you 're gone .
There isn n't a lot of hype associated with it .
It just happens .
It happened to Jimmy Hitchcock .
The cornerback improved leaps and bounds from the year before and gave the Patriots a quality performance for someone who was picked on so often .
Hitchcock was replaced , however .
Jones is being asked to be the starting right corner , even though he has played defensive back _ and strong safety , at that _ for only two years .
But Jones is the classic Carroll player : young , fast , and strong .
`` I watched him on film and he caught my eye , '' said Carroll .
`` I thought to myself that he could be a player who could fit into our scheme and into our plans beautifully .
He 's big , aggressive , and he loves to play .
I just knew that this is the type of kid who could help our football team .
`` Obviously , we 'd love for him to play the right corner , and I think he could be a good NFL corner , but if he needs more time , I know Tebucky Jones is going to be a factor for this team somewhere on the field . ''
If Carroll is paying special attention to Jones , who has been set back by a hamstring pull , it 's because his one regret from last year is that he didn n't do enough developing of young players .
He second-guesses himself a lot on Sedrick Shaw , whom he wishes he had brought along quicker _ particularly after Martin went down with an injured abdominal muscle .
`` I think there was so much going on with my first year and trying to get things organized that one thing I didn n't do as much of was develop the young players , '' said Carroll .
`` We 're going to do that all through the year .
What we want to accomplish is a situation where the young players can push the veterans and if a veteran misses some time with injuries we can bring a young guy in and we won n't lose a step .
That 's what we 're trying to create in everything we do .
`` The competition in camp is going to be greater than it 's ever been .
We have competition everywhere on the field .
And it 's the players who are up for that competition who will benefit the most . ''
One place where it 'll be fierce is the offensive line .
`` I don n't know if our young linemen can unseat the veterans , but they 're going to get a chance to do it , '' said Carroll .
`` I know right now Heath Irwin is in his third year and he seems the best-equipped to step in and take a job .
He 's about 300 pounds , which is about the size of a Todd Rucci .
Damon ( Denson ) could also be a guy who 's ready .
Scott ( Rehberg ) and Ed ( Ellis ) have worked so hard to improve and they 'll get their shots . ''
Carroll wasn n't pleased with Zefross Moss 's conditioning at the mini-camp and acknowledged that Bruce Armstrong was heavier than he expected .
But Armstrong has a history of being in shape when the bell rings , said Carroll , so he isn n't worried .
Moss , though , `` doesn n't have that history , '' said the coach .
`` He needs to come to camp in shape . ''
On the subject of Terry Glenn , Carroll isn n't going to make excuses for the Patriots ' offense based on whether Glenn plays or not .
`` He needs all six weeks before camp to have a good offseason , '' said Carroll .
`` He doesn n't have any more restrictions from his injury .
At this point , it 's all up to him . ''
The attitude on Glenn gives hope to Vincent Brisby , who was heading to the salary-cap scrap heap but now appears to be back in good standing if he performs up to his $ 1.2 million salary .
`` Ernie ( Zampese ) is used to having a big receiver in his offense and they 're hard to find , '' said Carroll .
`` We have one right here on our team , so Vincent will get his opportunity to assume that role . ''
It is assumed that the Patriots ' defense will pick up where it left off , but Carroll is cautious .
`` We haven n't played yet , '' he said .
`` We can n't assume anything .
We have to approach it with the right attitude .
I think we have a nice blend of veterans and younger guys .
We have Henry Thomas and Willie Clay and Willie ( McGinest ) , Ted ( Johnson ) , and Chris ( Slade ) .
We 're hoping to get Brandon Mitchell integrated into the line rotation inside .
Our linebackers are pretty set , but we 'd like to see Tedy Bruschi continue to compete with Todd ( Collins ) for more playing time . ''
Carroll is thrilled with his young cornerbacks : Jones , Terry Billups , Mark Tate , and Kato Serwanga .
They 're raw , but fast .
He has Steve Israel returning , and the team is also considering Pittsburgh veteran Donnell Woolford if they need a stopgap .
Carroll feels younger , faster players will be better on special teams .
He thinks Jones , Harold Shaw , Chris Floyd , et al will be much better cover men than some of the veterans who have departed .
Where he may feel the pinch is replacing Meggett .
`` Right now , Troy Brown is my punt returner , '' said Carroll .
`` I feel comfortable with Troy back there .
But here 's a case where this will be wide-open competition .
We have guys like Chris Canty and Tony Gaiter who could take the job .
Tony has great moves .
He had an excellent minicamp , but what Tony has to show is that he can stay on his feet . ''
Carroll has seen a renewed urgency in Canty 's game .
`` He did some really good things in minicamp , '' said Carroll .
`` For one thing he 's in much better shape than he was last year at this time and we 're seeing the benefit of that .
He seems to be taking everything more seriously . ''
Is that attitude due to the threat of Jones ?
`` That could be part of it , '' said Carroll .
`` That 's what I mean about creating competition .
If these guys can feel it and if they compete like , ` You 're not going to take this away from me , ' that makes our entire organization so much better . ''
Carroll thinks he has enough veterans to offset the loss of leadership .
`` We know that Bruce is a strong voice on this team and on our offense , '' he said .
`` Shawn Jefferson does some great leadership things and Drew ( Bledsoe ) seems to be taking more on every year .
I don n't want to overload Drew with that and I didn n't want him to step out of character to do something he 's not comfortable with , but within what he is able to offer , I think you 'll see him show more .
`` On defense , we have a bunch of guys like Chris , Willie McGinest , Willie Clay , Ted , Ty , Lawyer _ they 're all assuming more in that area .
Larry Whigham is a guy that gets the team going , so that 's why I believe we 're all right in that area . ''
Carroll is looking forward to the rivalries and the competition in the division .
Jimmy Johnson will be gunning for revenge after the Patriots beat the Dolphins three times last season , including in the first round of the playoffs .
Parcells , against whom the Patriots split , always has incentive to beat his old team .
`` It 's the challenge that gets the juices flowing , '' said Carroll .
`` Anytime you can compete with coaches with those credentials and beat them , it 's a great feeling .
I enjoyed competing against Marv ( Levy ) and I know his leaving ( Buffalo ) is tough on me personally because I 've always admired him .
But now Wade ( Phillips ) has the challenge of having to replace Marv .
`` I don n't have a personal relationship with Jimmy or Bill and I probably never will , but I think the battles we 'll have on the field will be interesting and competitive and it 'll keep everyone 's interest level high . ''
In Carroll 's first year in New England , when he had to deal with the pressure of replacing Parcells , getting organized , and implementing new systems , the Patriots made it to the second round of the playoffs .
It was a step back from a Super Bowl appearance , but the Patriots did not fall on their faces .
The fact is that , with Martin , with Gash , with Byars , and with Meggett , the 1997 Patriots didn n't have a good offense ( except for the first four games ) .
Now they 'll get to start fresh .
`` If there 's any silver lining , that 's it , '' said Carroll .
`` We 'll be able to replace some of those offensive players with more athletic players . ''
Young , fast , and strong .
_ _ _ & QC ;
With a snap of the fingers , the New York Legislature approved $ 95 million in improvements for Rich Stadium in Buffalo , all of it to come out of taxpayers ' pockets ...
Those in the political loop in Providence are saying they fully expect another dance with the Patriots before all is said and done .
Hartford is certainly stepping up , trying to include the Patriots in their $ 1 billion downtown project that would include a domed stadium .
& UR ; Bob Kraft & LR ; remains mum , indicating the team 's first priority remains a new stadium in Foxborough ...
A huge boost for the Patriots is the return of veteran end & UR ; Ferric Collons & LR ; , & UR ; & LR ; who is considered their best run-stopper on the line .
Collons missed half the season after undergoing surgery on a chest muscle .
`` Ferric coming back should be a big factor for us , '' said line coach & UR ; Ray Hamilton & LR ; .
`` I think he 's hungry to play again after missing so much time last year with his injury .
We have a chance to have a very competitive camp and hopefully guys will come in with the attitude that they want someone 's job . ''
...
There are some players upset about contracts they signed a year sooner than they probably should have .
San Diego 's & UR ; Junior Seau & LR ; is a prime example .
He missed the first two days of the team 's voluntary minicamp apparently because he is unhappy with the five-year , $ 27.1 million deal he signed last year .
Seau disputed that , saying he was on a family vacation .
San Diego general manager & UR ; Bobby Beathard & LR ; and coach & UR ; Kevin Gilbride & LR ; fumed at the no-show , considering that the Chargers were 4 - 12 a year ago and Seau is supposed to be the team leader .
He sets a great example for top draft pick & UR ; Ryan Leaf & LR ; .
GMs and coaches are watching to see what the effect of the big contracts will be around the league , especially in the wake of the windfall television deal .
`` It 's something we have to monitor closely , '' said Carroll .
`` All of a sudden , guys who were making decent money are making more money than they 'll ever need . ''
...
Another late arriver to camp was Buffalo running back & UR ; Thurman Thomas & LR ; , & UR ; & LR ; who was coaching his daughter 's softball team .
He had missed a previous camp to take part in a football clinic in Houston .
Thomas admitted he was a little peeved about his role not being defined after 10 years with the Bills .
`` I wasn n't that upset , '' said Thomas , `` but I felt like I was here for 10 years and I thought I would have been told what my role was going to be . ''
If you 're thinking trade with the Patriots , forget it .
Same division , and the Patriots wouldn n't give up draft picks ...
The 49 ers have made & UR ; Jerry Rice & LR ; take it easy as he returns from his knee injury .
He should be ready by the July 21 training camp .
Unfortunately , the 49 ers ' offensive line is in disarray .
Replenishing it was their one big need and they haven n't done it well .
_ _ _ & QC ;
The news gets better for Boston University punter and kickoff man & UR ; Ed Costello & LR ; , & UR ; & LR ; who was signed by the Bengals .
Cincinnati veteran & UR ; Lee Johnson & LR ; is talking about retiring , conceding that he can n't kick as well as Costello anymore .
`` I can n't beat out a young leg like that , '' Johnson said .
`` I know because I had one once . ''
...
The Bears appear close to downsizing quarterback & UR ; Rick Mirer 's & LR ; five-year , $ 10 million contract ...
Days after giving up a fifth-rounder to obtain veteran defensive tackle & UR ; Shawn Lee & LR ; from the Chargers , the Bears released troubled defensive end & UR ; Alonzo Spellman & LR ; Friday .
The Bears were fed up with Spellman , who following an injury-plagued season wound up in a psychiatric ward earlier this year after barricading himself in the home of his publicist ...
Former Vikings owner & UR ; Mike Lynn & LR ; is actually thinking about putting together a group to buy the team back .
The money here is on & UR ; Carl Pohlad & LR ; , & UR ; & LR ; the Minnesota Twins owner .
One of the richest men in America , Pohlad helped ruin the baseball franchise with his penny-pinching ...
The Raiders are expected to receive a compensatory pick between the first and second round next year following the death of Washington State lineman & UR ; Leon Bender & LR ; , their second-round pick this year & UR ; & LR ; ...
One complaint heard at the Patriots ' fan day last week at Foxboro Stadium is that not enough fans got autographs because players were able to sign only for those leaning over the railings ...
& UR ; Vinny Testaverde & LR ; , released by the Ravens , has been talking all week to the Bengals , but things hit a snag late in the week ...
For what it 's worth _ and maybe that 's not a whole lot _ Bledsoe and & UR ; Scott Zolak & LR ; have been together as starter and backup longer than any other quarterback tandem in the league : six years .
