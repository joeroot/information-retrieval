IT 'S BEEN A COSMIC HALF CENTURY FOR PALOMAR 'S 200-INCH TELESCOPE

Fifty years ago Wednesday some 800 astronomers and VIPs gathered under the new Hale Telescope on the summit of Palomar Mountain , near San Diego , to celebrate the telescope 's `` first light , '' as astronomers call the moment when a new telescope is opened to the night sky for the first time .
The Hale Telescope , named for George Ellery Hale , who proposed it in 1928 , was the largest and greatest working telescope on earth .
For more than a generation , the world 's leading astronomers used the Hale to make fundamental discoveries that changed our views of the universe .
Allan Sandage spent 20 years using the Hale to explore the size and age of the universe , a project that seems to have a grandeur beyond almost any other quest in science .
In 1963 , Maarten Schmidt was using the Hale to examine quasars when he discovered that quasars are not the nearby stars astronomers had assumed them to be , but powerful , brilliant objects in the distant reaches of the universe , a discovery that revealed that the universe contains objects of almost incredible energy .
( Quasars are now believed to be supermassive black holes swallowing matter at the centers of distant galaxies . )
The telescope was originally operated jointly by the Mount Wilson Observatory and the California Institute of Technology , but after years of feuding over the management of the telescope , the two institutions divorced in the 1980s , leaving Caltech in charge on Palomar .
The Hale was probably the most famous scientific instrument in history even before starlight had graced its mirror , and it seemed to symbolize the 20th century 's greatest hopes .
George Ellery Hale , a solar physicist , had a vivid imagination and a talent for fund-raising .
His imagination seemed to overpower him at times , and he suffered from frequent nervous breakdowns .
Hale apparently sometimes thought that an elf was sitting on his shoulder , talking to him .
His telescope project nevertheless took on immense importance when the astronomer Edwin Hubble , of Mount Wilson , discovered that the universe was expanding .
The great ambition of the 200-inch project was to explore the meaning of the expanding-universe discovery and determine the overall structure of the universe .
Financed by a $ 6 million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation , the telescope took 20 years to build , until the project become the scientific equivalent of a cathedral .
Hale died before the telescope was finished , and never saw its full majesty .
The Hale Telescope is seven stories tall and sits inside an Art-Deco-style dome that is almost exactly the size of the Pantheon in Rome .
It consists of at least 250,000 parts , though not even Hal Petrie , the chief engineer of Palomar Observatory , is sure of the number .
`` The vast majority of the parts were designed and built for the telescope , and were machined or cast by hand _ even the smallest parts of ball bearings , '' Petrie said .
The telescope glides on Flying Horse Telescope Oil , developed by Mobil Corp. in the 1930s , and it is so beautifully balanced that only a single grapefruit-sized electric motor is needed to drive the entire 530-ton behemoth as it follows the stars across the sky .
`` I 've moved the telescope by hand , '' Petrie said .
There are only 20 gallons of Flying Horse oil left .
Petrie said that he will soon switch to ordinary motor oil .
The Hale 's main mirror is a waffle-textured disk of Pyrex glass 200 inches ( nearly 17 feet , or 5 meters ) across , and it weighs 14 tons , making it the heaviest piece of glass in the world .
It was cast in 1934 at the Corning Glass Works , in Corning , N.Y . , amid a swirl of newspaper reports and live radio broadcasts .
The glass spent a year cooling in a special oven , and then it was carried across the United States to the Caltech optical shop in Pasadena , while crowds gathered along the tracks to watch the `` Telescope Train '' pass .
Polishing the glass took 13 years .
During that time , Caltech opticians ground away 7 tons of powdered glass .
The opticians gave the mirror its final shape by hand , rubbing it with polishing disks the size of coins , using the finest jeweler 's rouge , even using powdered walnut shells .
In the end , they stroked the glass with their bare thumbs _ the ridges of a human finger were enough to give the glass its final polish .
Scientific instruments normally last a few years before they become obsolete , but the Hale is a striking exception to that rule .
Astronomers have installed advanced electronic sensors on the Hale that have kept it competitive with larger ground-based telescopes , like the Kecks in Hawaii , and it is still being used to make discoveries .
Earlier this year , Dr. Stephen Eikenberry , a Caltech astronomer , used a high-speed infrared camera on the Hale to take `` movies '' of black holes swallowing matter inside our galaxy , shot at 10 frames a second .
`` We saw evidence of material flowing into a black hole and suddenly disappearing , '' Eikenberry said .
In 1995 , Dr. Shrinivas Kulkarni used the Hale Telescope to discover the first known brown dwarf star _ a faint star that resembles a glowing version of the planet Jupiter .
And last fall , Philip Nicholson of Cornell University used the Hale to discover two new moons orbiting the planet Uranus .
Will the Hale Telescope be working 50 years from now ?
`` Yes _ but maybe not , '' Kulkarni said .
Kulkarni said that the best place for a telescope is in outer space , where the view is clearest .
`` Assuming there are no major wars , and rocket flights are routine , then I can imagine all astronomy being done in space , '' Kulkarni said .
`` I can also imagine an alternative world , where we 'll have our usual problems , and space will remain an expensive endeavor .
Then the Hale will still be part of astronomy . ''
In that case , Petrie has collected a large shelf of engineering textbooks dating from the 1930s for future Palomar engineers to use as reference manuals .
