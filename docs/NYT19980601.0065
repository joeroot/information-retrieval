CUAUHTEMOC , Mexico _ There are no fire hydrants in this village on the edge of the rainforest .
There are also no telephones and no electricity .
Miles of twisting , unpaved mountain roads separate the town from the nearest city .
If the 55 families who live here lose control of the annual fires they light to burn away the stubble of last year 's crop , they have no way to quickly notify anyone .
They are largely on their own .
Thousands of tiny communities like this are scattered across the state of Chiapas , places where families grow maize and coffee and graze cattle on steep hillsides , using ancient slash-and-burn methods to prepare the soil for planting or to coax grasses out of the ground .
The vast majority of the people have neither tractors nor plows to till the soil .
Women and children walk along the dirt roads , carrying bundles of firewood on their backs supported by straps stretched across their foreheads .
In the mountains around them , plumes of white smoke rise lazily in the midday heat .
Cerapio Hernandez Heleria usually would have burned his plots of land by now .
But the continuing drought , plus the fear of losing control of the flames and starting an enormous fire like the one now burning in the nearby El Ocote wilderness preserve , keeps Hernandez uncomfortably idle .
`` Almost nobody in this area is burning , '' Hernandez , 48 , said as young turkeys pecked at the dirt at his feet .
`` We 're waiting for it to rain .
There 's been too many fires already . ''
The blackened fields dotting the mountains on the eastern edge of the rain forest show that few communities are following Cuauhtemoc in its self-imposed burning ban .
On Sunday , men and boys could be seen on steep hillside fields , hacking at weeds and brush with machetes as they prepared to burn .
The government has blamed the farmers and ranchers for starting the fires , which have scorched thousands of acres of sensitive rain forest in the Chimalapas region west of here and have contributed to the choking smoke that fills the valleys of Chiapas and has blown north to Texas and beyond .
But government environmental officials also have said they realize there is no way to stop agricultural burning , and until this year , there has been little incentive to try .
The rains have always been dependable before , keeping the jungle wet and fireproof and stopping any wayward field fires before they spread too far .
This year , the rains haven n't come .
The countryside , even the rainforest , dried out , and the winds gusted .
When the fields began burning , the fires jumped the narrow strips of bare earth that farmers typically clear around their land .
And there was no way to stop the flames .
Sergio Garcia Murillo , an official with Mexico 's environmental and wildlife department who is helping to coordinate the firefighting effort in western Chiapas , said poverty is the true cause of the fires .
The growing population is stretching the land 's capacity , Garcia said .
Farmland in the valleys is becoming less productive with more intensive use , he said , and more farmers and ranchers are encroaching on the rain forest , looking for better land .
When agricultural fires jump out of the fields and into the forest , often the farmers and ranchers don n't alert the government , Garcia said .
That 's not surprising in Chiapas , where many people have a deep mistrust of the government and where the Zapatista rebels staged a revolt in January 1994 , decrying what they said was long-standing mistreatment by the government and the state 's large landholders .
But as it faces the worst fires in its history , the government has relied heavily on the people in the surrounding communities to help fight them .
Together with soldiers who have been ordered to remote outposts in the mountains , the villagers form the backbone of the untrained firefighting force .
Hernandez said he joined about 45 of his neighbors in Cauhtemoc when the government asked for help fighting the flames in El Ocote in April .
`` They offered food and water , nothing else , '' he said .
`` After we finished working , we got on our horses and went out using machetes and rakes to clear away the dry layer of vegetation on the jungle floor . ''
Down the road in another small village , Elias Martinez said people have been careful when they burn , but the unusual conditions have made runaway fires inevitable .
He 's a little annoyed that the government says agricultural burning started the fires .
How do they know it wasn n't a carelessly tossed cigarette ?
`` Nobody wants to start fires , '' said Martinez , who runs a small ranch .
`` The wind and the dryness _ they are things that can n't be controlled .
It 's too bad that things are burning , but there 's no other way to prepare the land .
Once we get some rain , everything will return to normal . ''
As the mountains glow around them at night from fires that have yet to be contained , Martinez and others who live off the thin , rocky soil are more concerned about how they will survive if the skies don n't bring relief .
`` We can n't plant yet .
The ground is too hard , '' said Alejandro de la Cruz , who grows maize and coffee in Rancho Carrizal , a small community of 32 people .
`` When it starts to rain , we start to plant .
If it doesn n't rain , we don n't eat .
`` Some people say the fires are a sign of the end of the world , '' he added .
`` I think so , too . ''
