GRIER A GAMBLER
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By Ron Borges c.1998 The Boston Globe
Bob Kraft often says he wants his managers to take risks , and he 'll back them when they do .
Maybe Bobby Grier took that idea a bit too literally .
In the latest issue of Pro Football Weekly , Joel Buchsbaum , a journalist by accident but a draftnik by inclination and obsession , lists the top 10 gambles in April 's draft .
According to Buchsbaum and the NFL scouts he spoke with , Grier made four of the first eight bets and he put the house on them .
Perhaps his own house , if things don n't pan out .
The majority of such analyses are easily ignored by career football men like Grier , who understand that they know more about this stuff than anyone else because they get paid to .
But Buchsbaum is the exception because he gets paid , too .
He has proven over the years to be more than a draftnik , his expertise in this rather arcane process having grown to the point where , supposedly , more than a few NFL teams have him on retainer as an adviser .
He is well-respected by some of the league 's best selectors of talent , men such as Green Bay 's Ron Wolf and San Diego 's Bobby Beathard , who have built Super Bowl teams at two or more addresses .
When such men endorse Buchsbaum 's opinions by endorsing his annual draft previews , it gives weight to his words .
Thus , it is not comforting to find him putting both of the Patriots ' first-round picks at the top of what he calls his `` Gut Check '' list .
`` Here are some names that scouts offered as either the gutsiest or riskiest picks in this year 's draft , '' Buchsbaum wrote , listing Tebucky Jones first and Robert Edwards third , with Minnesota 's Randy Moss in between .
Not far behind were New England 's second-round choices , Tony Simmons , listed as the sixth-riskiest , and Rod Rutledge , who was eighth .
That 's a lot of risk , especially considering that with the quality of the team New England already had , there was little need to gamble with this draft .
Grier declined to comment on that or anything else this past week , saying he wanted to keep a low profile until training camp opens because `` nothing 's going on . ''
It is safe to conclude that a man who has been in the NFL for much of his adult life understands that few teams hit on the majority of their top picks .
Wolf and his pal , Bill Parcells , have often said that if you hit 25 percent in the draft you 've done well .
With that as a measuring stick , Grier saw himself with six of the first 84 picks and went for the big reward fully aware of the big risk .
Jones , a defensive back , was intriguing to many coaches because of his unusual size / speed combination , but as Buchsbaum points out , he `` could be another Lester Hayes or another Anthony Phillips ...
the all-time workout warrior . ''
Nobody looks better in a uniform than Jones and nobody looks better running the 40 .
But the Patriots were careful to keep him away from their top receivers during the spring minicamps as they broke him into a cornerback position that he 's never played before .
Head coach Pete Carroll and Grier know the cornerback business is as much mental as physical , and there was no need to risk Jones 's psyche this early .
But eventually he will have to cover such receivers , and if he can do it , why wasn n't he doing it in college ?
As for running back Edwards , the concern is twofold .
Buchsbaum and the scouts point out that he 's never lasted a full college season without injury and now he 's coming into a league where the season is twice as long .
Fine , but that 's only the half of it .
The other half is that the same rap was put on Curtis Martin when he came out of Pitt , and he answered every charge as well as the bell on nearly every down until late last season .
Is it not tempting fate to ask his replacement to do the same ?
If you believe in bad karma , poor Edwards would seem to be walking into it .
As for Simmons , I 've seen a lot of coaches go broke on speed merchants who were `` underproductive in college , '' as they like to say in the NFL .
That he and Jones have unlimited potential is true , something Carroll pointed out to me last month .
But I kept hearing the words of my father , who used to say , `` Potential just means you haven n't done a damn thing yet . ''
As for Rutledge , the consensus is that he could help a battered Ben Coates if he can play the way he did before injuring his knee .
But of everything that was written by Buchsbaum , the most illustrative comment of the route Kraft , Grier , and Carroll chose this spring was this quote from a scout :
`` In our mind , all four of the Patriots ' first - and second-round picks were high-risk picks who could make them the team to beat in all of football or make them look awfully bad for letting Curtis Martin go . ''
If the former is true , Kraft will never have to show how much risk he 's willing to back .
But if the latter is true , Grier will have to hope Kraft meant what he said about his willingness to bankroll a gambling employee knowing they didn n't build Las Vegas by letting the gamblers win very often .
A recount on draft
They won n't have a team in Cleveland until 1999 but the new Browns have already caused the Patriots a small headache .
An agreement has been reached between the league and the NFL Players Association on how to stock the expansion Browns , and it is similar to the process by which Jacksonville and Carolina acquired players .
That means the Patriots ' extra draft choices next season just went down in value a couple of notches because the Browns will have the first pick in each of the seven rounds as well as an extra pick at the end of those rounds .
In addition to the extra picks , the Browns will be allowed to select 30 veterans from an expansion draft list , to whom they will have to pay at least $ 22 million of their salary cap ...
Whoever ends up with the Cleveland franchise will have plenty of cash to pay the players .
More than 52,000 season tickets have been sold _ for a team that doesn n't exist and will play in a stadium that doesn n't exist .
Why did Art Modell ever leave ?
...
Word is as soon as the collective bargaining agreement extension is signed , Buffalo will hand new quarterback Rob Johnson a huge contract extension that will pay $ 4 million - $ 5 million a season with at least a $ 6 million signing bonus .
Think what they might have paid him if he 'd started two NFL games instead of just one ...
Bills linebacker Chris Spielman was at recent minicamp practices at 5 : 30 a.m. , even though the medical staff won n't let him participate in contact drills yet , as he is coming off neck surgery ...
When the Broncos released journeyman safety Dedrick Dodge last week , it was a footnote in football history .
Dodge is one of only 13 players to be on winning Super Bowl teams in both conferences .
In 1994 , Dodge was a reserve on the San Francisco 49 ers ...
Although noted orator and All-Pro defensive end Reggie White has been working several hours a day on rehabilitating his back , soreness kept him out of the team 's recent minicamp workouts .
White nearly was forced into retirement because of persistent back spasms and constant pain last season , but he has rededicated himself to prepare for the 1998 season .
With Gabe Wilkins lost to free agency , No. 1 draft choice Vonnie Holliday has the inside track on the right defensive end position , with the team still hoping White can be a regular on the left side ...
Don n't want to say Parcells believes in loyalty or anything , but a look at the Jets roster going into next month 's training camp finds 11 ex-Patriots and ex-Giants on it ...
Jets wide receiver Wayne Chrebet , who is among the all-time overachievers in NFL history , believes he will not be sharing his position this year , although he will be back in the slot receiver 's spot in many formations .
Although Chrebet has caught 208 passes in his three years in the NFL , last year he had to split time with the now-departed Jeff Graham .
Dedric Ward and Alex Van Dyke are expected to press him again this year , but Chrebet has been told he and Keyshawn Johnson will be the regulars .
`` The three-man rotation is over and done with for now , '' Chrebet said last week .
Don n't brace yourself
Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell has decided to play this season without the bulky knee brace that he felt limited his mobility last season .
He suffered a severe knee injury from which he rebounded far faster than most thought possible , and now he is going to tempt fate by opting for mobility over protection ...
Congratulations are due old friend Hugh Millen .
The ex-Patriots quarterback , who is now retired in Seattle after playing more than 10 years in the NFL , is to be married in Colorado .
And they said it couldn n't be done ...
Word is Kraft is among nearly a dozen NFL owners who have expressed an interest to commissioner Paul Tagliabue in buying Arena Football franchises .
Saints boss Tom Benson has opened the way by gaining league approval to purchase one .
Benson paid $ 7 million for his Arena franchise this year , one-10th what he paid for the Saints in 1985 .
The reason for the owners ' interest is to keep young fans interested in football year-round .
Efforts to reach Kraft were unsuccessful .
His secretary said he was out of the country ...
The Dolphins ' No. 1 draft choice , running back John Avery , apparently takes things seriously .
After fumbling during a recent minicamp , he reportedly has been lugging a ball around with him everywhere he goes , including on dates and when he goes to bed ...
Denver 's 36-year-old All-Pro left tackle , Gary Zimmerman , did not appear at either of the Broncos ' spring minicamps and has not decided whether he will return for another season .
Zimmerman briefly retired last season but was lured back early in the year , forcing Tony Jones to shift from left tackle to the right side .
Many believed that if quarterback John Elway retired , Zimmerman would have joined him .
It is now assumed he will return with Elway ...
On the same day that Tennessee running back Eddie George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this month , his backup , Rodney Thomas , signed a four-year , $ 4 million deal .
Thomas may be the best backup running back in football ...
Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson signed a familiar face last week to bolster his leaky defensive line .
After failing to come up a winner in the Sean Gilbert Sweepstakes , Johnson settled for Northeastern product and ex-Patriot Josh Taves , the defensive MVP of NFL Europe this spring .
Taves , who had nine sacks in 10 games for Jack Bicknell 's Barcelona Dragons , is a veteran of three teams in three years ( Detroit , Jacksonville , New England ) but may have a better chance with Miami than many think .
He outweighs all four of the other Dolphin defensive ends by nearly 20 pounds ( he is 6 feet 7 inches , 285 pounds ) and will challenge veterans Trace Armstrong and Danny Stubbs for playing time ...
Best wishes to former New Englander Mike George , the agent for Coates , Vincent Brisby , Irving Fryar , and others .
George , 45 , suffered sudden cardiac arrest last month , and a 100 percent blockage was found in one artery , a condition his doctors told him was fatal 78 percent of the time .
After undergoing bypass surgery , the Florida-based agent is doing well , although trying to find a safe haven for Brisby hasn n't eased his stress ...
Old friend and Boston University alum Billy Brooks was recently named director of community development and player relations for the Colts , the team for which he had more than 50 receptions in six straight seasons .
Brooks , who retired after the 1996 season , will be inducted into the Colts ' Ring of Honor in August .
