SAARC Makes Slow Progress : World Bank Economist
KATHMANDU , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- A World Bank economist said here Wednesday that the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) has made a slow progress in the past 13 years .
" It 's clearly a slow progress .
It hasn n't developed into as a dynamic regional grouping as some of the others , " John Williamson , the World Bank 's chief economist for South Asia , told Xinhua in an interview .
The economist ended his three-day visit in Kathmandu Wednesday .
He said that not just in Europe , the Mercado Comun del Sur ( MERCOSUR ) in South America and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) have achieved a lot more , and " in some cases , much quicker " than South Asia has accomplished so far .
" There are some particular reasons for that , " he noted .
He said that some of the SAARC countries have important bilateral disagreements , making it more challenging to build up regional organization .
" The main prerequisite in my mind would be a willingness on the part of India and Pakistan to resolve their bilateral disagreements , " he observed .
" Until that is resolved , it is very difficult to see how a regional organization that embraces both ( of them ) can really go forward , " he added .
He said that he hopes for the resolution of disputes though it looks hopeless at times .
" We just have to hope that statesmen in India and Pakistan will finally see how important it is to achieve that sort of reconciliation " in North Ireland and South Africa , he stressed .
The SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote the economic and social development among its seven member countries -- Bangladesh , Bhutan , India , the Maldives , Nepal , Pakistan and Sri Lanka .
Williamson said that he did not agree that the SAARC has laid a solid foundation for further development .
" I hope it can go much faster in the future , but I think if that happens , it will be because what 's done from now on , not because solid foundation has been laid up to now , " he added .
