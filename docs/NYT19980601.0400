''
By IAN SPELLING ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & HT ; Peter Weir isn n't shy about the box-office performance of his most recent film , the plane-crash drama `` Fearless '' ( 1993 ) .
& HT ; `` It died , '' the Australian director says calmly .
`` It was a commercial disaster . ''
& HT ; Many directors would have responded to this reverse by immediately signing onto the most obvious commercial hit they could find , no matter how brainless , for fear that they 'd get a name in Hollywood as box-office poison .
& HT ; Weir , on the other hand , let several years go by , then invested three years of work in the June 5 release , `` The Truman Show , '' a strikingly original drama / comedy starring Jim Carrey which is , if anything , even more commercially problematic than `` Fearless . ''
& HT ; `` I have nothing against hits , '' the soft-spoken Weir says as he lounges on a couch at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan .
`` I 've been fortunate enough to have a long career , and I feel that I 'm still in my prime .
I just believe that the only way to keep going is to push oneself .
& HT ; `` Films can be tough , '' he admits .
`` You can attract unpleasant people at times .
The stakes are high and , above all , it 's difficult to make a good film .
& HT ; `` I don n't know how many films I 've got left in me and , not to sound pretentious , I 'd like to try to protect the art of making films , '' he says .
`` The only way to do that is to choose something I 'm fascinated by . ''
& HT ; The stories that fascinated Weir in the past have produced a diverse , critically acclaimed body of films , among them `` Picnic at Hanging Rock '' ( 1975 ) , `` Gallipoli '' ( 1981 ) , `` The Year of Living Dangerously '' ( 1981 ) , `` Witness '' ( 1985 ) , `` Dead Poets Society '' ( 1989 ) and `` Green Card '' ( 1990 ) .
& HT ; `` My films may or may not be commercial , and that 's fine , '' the 53-year-old director says .
`` To me , filmmaking is quite unlike life .
& HT ; `` In life you supposedly get wiser or , as some call it , more conservative , '' he says .
`` You experience things and don n't do them anymore .
You 've burned your fingers , had your crazy times and become wiser .
That 's not unreasonable .
& HT ; `` In the creative life , you can n't do that , '' Weir adds .
`` You just can n't . ''
& HT ; Dark-edged and ambitious , `` The Truman Show '' ushers audiences into the candy-coated world of Truman Burbank ( Carrey ) , a giddily happy man who slowly comes to realize that his entire life has been spent as the unwitting star of a nonstop , internationally beloved television show .
All the people around him _ including his mother ( Holland Taylor ) , wife ( Laura Linney ) and best friend ( Noah Emmerich ) _ are actors paid to play their parts .
& HT ; Overseeing everything is the show 's enigmatic creator / director , Christof ( Ed Harris ) , whose 5,000 cameras capture Truman 's every move as he roams about picture-perfect Seahaven , actually a domed set built specifically for Truman .
There are no standard commercials during the show _ instead , the characters promote products as they interact with Truman .
& HT ; Moviegoers may see `` The Truman Show '' as an indictment of television , the media and / or the insatiable thirst for the most intimate details about our favorite celebrities , and any of those views pleases Weir .
& HT ; `` The film pokes a stick in the eye of the beast , '' Weir says .
`` In a way , you 're sane if you laugh .
Fame is one aspect , gossip is another and the media as a whole is another .
& HT ; `` My carpenter was chatting with me one day about Leonardo DiCaprio , '' he recalls .
`` He was the last person in the world I expected to know or care about a celebrity 's private life .
& HT ; `` But he did , because no one can get away from any of it . ''
& HT ; Least of all Jim Carrey , the $ 20 million man , who begins and ends each day under the glare of paparazzi flashbulbs .
That , plus his agreeing to a relatively modest payday of $ 12 million , made Carrey perfect for `` The Truman Show , '' as far as Weir and producer Scott Rudin were concerned .
& HT ; `` My thinking was that we needed a star to play Truman , '' says the director , who did the same funnyman-goes-dramatic with Robin Williams in `` Dead Poets Society . ''
`` Truman was a natural star who just didn n't know he was a star .
So I had to have a star .
& HT ; `` I looked at a short list of actors , but none of them seemed very suitable , '' he recalls .
`` Tom Hanks did , but he 'd just done ` Forrest Gump ' ( 1994 ) .
A couple of weeks later , Scott Rudin rang and suggested Jim .
& HT ; `` I thought he was great , brilliant , and Scott said he was interested , '' Weir says .
`` After ` Liar , Liar ' ( 1997 ) , Jim wanted to broaden his range , his possibilities as an actor .
& HT ; `` We met , and I just knew that Jim had what I needed in Truman , who 's a man with charm and a simpleness to him , a man who 's not quite normal , like a boy raised by wolves .
& HT ; `` We agreed that Jim would explore the broader possibilities of the humor and that I 'd pull him back if necessary , or that I 'd use a subtler take , '' the director says .
`` Jim and I had a good , collaborative working relationship , and I 'm very impressed with his work in the film . ''
& HT ; Still , the director acknowledges , `` The Truman Show '' may leave some people cold .
& HT ; `` It had to be real and restrained , '' he says .
`` Might some people find the movie too unemotional for them ?
Perhaps .
But it 's as emotional as I thought necessary . ''
& HT ; Will audiences ultimately get what `` The Truman Show '' is all about ?
& HT ; `` There will be people who are interested in its dense story , who enjoy reflecting on the story 's context , who just get the joke , '' Weir says .
`` Probably an equal percentage or a larger percentage might not , but I think they 'll at least appreciate the entertainment value in it . ''
& HT ; Weir himself , who created 30 years of backstory for both Truman and Christof , tinkered with and fine-tuned `` The Truman Show '' until the last minute .
& HT ; `` I feel a certain lightness getting ready to let it go out there to the public , '' he says .
`` It has been a long three-year period .
& HT ; `` On the other hand , '' he adds , `` I started to see Truman-esque moments in my life , on TV , in the media .
In my head , I keep spinning the story on : ` Is that real ?
Where are the cameras ? '' ' & HT ; The director chuckles .
& HT ; `` Maybe it is time I let the film go . ''
& HT ; When not working , Weir retreats to a house in Australia that he shares with his wife and children .
Even at home , though , the director sometimes can n't help but call the shots .
& HT ; `` I 'm not at all nostalgic about my old films , but I 'm rather difficult to live with right after I finish a movie , '' he says , laughing .
`` A shopping expedition can be painful for my wife , I 'm so busy taking charge of the purchasing .
& HT ; `` I 've got a certain impatience that carries over , '' he admits .
`` But it fades away very quickly .
When everything calms down , I 'm pretty normal . ''
& HT ; Normal and grateful , he adds .
& HT ; `` Each film I do is a world unto itself , '' Weir says .
`` I was absolutely absorbed by the tragedy that happened on Mt. Everest a couple of summers ago , and I 've used it as a filmmaking analogy since , not at all to diminish the tragedy .
& HT ; `` A couple of extremely experienced climbers lost their lives , '' he recalls .
`` Directors are , in a sense , mountain climbers .
I 'm an extremely experienced one , and I have all the knowledge of how to do the craft of climbing , but each film is a new mountain .
& HT ; `` If my luck changes , if the weather turns on me , I can lose my way and fail , '' Weir says .
`` That 's what keeps me true and grounded . ''
