SALVAGING ISSUE IS HEATING UP
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By DAVID ARNOLD c.1998 The Boston Globe
Priscilla E. Muller can remember the name , but not the face , of the man who walked through her door Jan. 26 , 1995 , asking her to authenticate what appeared to be a centuries-old , gem-studded rosary .
So many people bearing jewels allegedly recovered from shipwrecks come in asking Muller , curator of the Hispanic Society of America Museum in New York City , to identify their treasures that she can n't possibly remember them all , she says .
Muller does recall telling the man the rosary design appeared to be similar to that found in Spain 's New World colonies 250 years ago .
That was about it .
The museum prohibits her from outright authenticating an artifact or allowing herself or the museum to be mentioned in any promotional material .
So she was somewhat taken aback last week to find herself being quoted on the Internet as praising the authenticity of the very same piece of jewelry _ now up for sale for $ 75 , 000 .
`` The whole field of treasure hunters is replete with people simply looking for money .
I find it all quite troubling , more so because the field is growing , '' says Muller , who is retiring after 30 years at the museum .
Treasure hunting is booming as a result of better and better technology for finding long-lost wrecks , creating not only a growing market in recovered artifacts , but an intensifying battle over whether it 's just good business or a greedy rape of our archeological past .
This summer , for example , a Virgina-based treasure hunter , with a flotilla of television producers in tow , plans to return to the five-mile deep site in the mid-Atlantic where he has located the wreck of a Japanese submarine bombed by Americans .
The I-52 , which salvors say is the deepest wreck ever located ( Titanic is 2 miles deep ) , sank in 1944 with approximately two tons of gold destined for Germany .
The salvor , Paul Tidwell , said the Americans dropped sonar bouys after the bombings , which picked up the sound of gunshots as the sub 's crew committed suicide .
Tidwell hopes to recover the gold and perhaps raise the submarine .
But the submarine is a war tomb , and while the Japanese government has remained somewhat quiet on the subject with Tidwell , one embassy official , requesting anonymity , said in an interview last week that his government will `` strongly object at the proper time . ''
It is just one example of how ethically muddied the salvage waters have gotten of late .
Some other examples :
_ Last February , Spain laid claim to all wrecks of its ships and their gold , wherever they lie , a step that raised some eyebrows among some academics who recall that the Spanish crown devastated numbers of indigenous civilizations in its search for riches a few centuries ago .
Among the wrecks targeted by the Spanish edict are two ships _ allegedly Spanish warships and carrying gold _ located just 1,000 feet off a Virginia beach .
Legal arguments over the ownership of these two ships are being prepared at the moment .
_ Last month , in an unrelated case , a US Supreme Court decision essentially granted salvors a giant step forward toward claiming ownership of wrecks discovered in US waters .
The case stems from the wreck of the sidewheeler Brother Jonathan , which sank in 1865 off the California coast with an army shipment of $ 2-million in gold .
Excavation can n't begin until further litigation establishes terms of ownership .
_ A 500-page tome released this month ( `` Ship of Gold '' by Gary Kinder ; Atlantic Monthly Press ) describes in detail how an Ohio engineer found the sidewheel steamship Central America , and continues to salvage it .
The sidewheeler sank in an 1857 hurricane off the Carolinas , taking 21 tons of California Goldrush gold 8,000 feet deep .
The details of how the material is being extracted is a tightly held secret , but the remote control arms of a six-ton robot built for this job are so versatile they can thread a bolt and nut .
_ Next month , the world community will debate in Paris a proposal by UNESCO , the United Nations ' cultural watchdog , to prohibit the trade in any artifacts salvaged for profit in international waters .
_ In August , Roger Williams University School of Law in Bristol , R.I . , will sponsor a symposium specifically addressing issues of law , technology , and ethics of treasure hunting , and elaborate on events at the UNESCO conference .
`` I would say that these days it 's hard to keep discussion on a rational level , such are the passions involved , '' said Lydel Prott , organizer of the UNESCO conference .
That passion stems from two very different approaches to salvaging wrecks , an issue that didn n't bubble to the surface until a dozen years ago when treasure hunters made two significant finds .
Barry Clifford located the remains of the pirate ship Whydah off Cape Cod , and Mel Fisher located the Nuestra Senora de Atocha _ with some $ 400 million in bullion _ off the Florida Keys .
Archeologists argue that an excavation done for profit will not be done with the time and attention to detail required to tell the story of the ship and its times , not just recover its artifacts .
And so until funds can be raised and academically trained archeologists can be assigned to the job , the wreck should remain untouched , they say .
`` The material will keep under water .
Our fear is always that real history is lost .
And none of these guys ( the salvors ) hangs around to write the book , '' said James Delgado , author of the Encyclopedia of Underwater and Maritime Archeology , published last month by Yale University Press .
Delgado is the executive director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum , which , like many museums , does not exhibit artifacts salvaged from wrecks for profit .
In the other camp are the treasure hunters _ they prefer `` commercial salvors '' _ who claim that without private enterprise and the willingness to take risks , humankind will be deprived of relics _ and the salvors their gold _ as they wait for government or museum funding for underwater excavations .
`` But there 's something greater at stake here , '' added Peter Hess , a treasure salvor attorney from Wilmington , Del. , who will speak on the issue of ethics at the Aug. 14 Roger Williams symposium , to be held in Newport .
`` Government laws of late increasingly require salvors to handle their finds responsibly .
Take away private enterprise _ and this applies most to the UNESCO proposal _ and the salvors will be forced to work fast and recklessly , because you 're never going to stop treasure hunting , '' says Hess .
Caught somewhere in the middle are the museums , as they try to sort out what comprises an `` ethical '' exhibit .
A year ago , for example , the South Street Seaport Museum in New York City sponsored a program on pirate lore and invited Kenneth Kinkor of Eastham , by all accounts the expert of the Whydah , the only pirate wreck ever located .
Academic archeologists who disapprove of how the Whydah excavation has been funded and executed got wind of the invitation .
They told museum officials that inviting Kinkor was akin to condoning treasure hunting .
South Street canceled Kinkor 's invitation , a decision the museum now regrets .
`` It was censorship , plain and simple , and it was wrong .
We have apologized to Mr. Kinkor , '' said Diane Dallal , director of archeology for the museum .
Another exhibit currently blackballed by academic purists is a collection from the wreck of the Henrietta Marie , a 1700s - slave ship discovered off Florida by treasure hunters and excavated in the mid-1980s .
By several accounts , the job was poorly done from an archeology perspective .
Nevertheless , 200 artifacts recovered from the wreck , including chains and shackles , have enabled researchers to trace the ship 's origins to London , and fill in with graphic new new details the early days of the slave trade .
Delgado 's Vancouver museum considers the exhibit tainted , a byproduct of profiteers , and therefore would be an improper exhibit at his museum .
`` By exhibiting artifacts from treasure hunters , we are condoning their work , '' Delgado said .
On the other hand , the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History chose to feature the Henrietta artifacts last fall .
In the three-month period they were on display , museum attendance more than doubled , from 40,000 to 90 , 300 , according to Karen Turner , director of special programs .
`` Teachers fastened onto the show .
There are so few tangible ways teach about slavery , '' Turner said .
In the end , the purists agree that the public , not the professors within ivory towers , will decide what is and isn n't ethical .
Delgado , for example , points out that two fathers of modern archeology _ Lord Carnarvon , financier of the Tutankhamen tomb discovery in 1922 , and Heinrich Schliemann , who found Troy in 1870 _ were , first and foremost , collectors , or treasure hunters .
At the Hispanic museum in New York , curator Muller says there was little doubt in her mind that the man who walked into her office in 1995 was a collector .
With the help of paperwork she provided , the Globe located Robert I. Colombo , a retired CIA agent , in Indialantic , & UR ; & LR ; Fla. Yes , he said , he remembered the meeting well , and he suggested that the only way an embellished account of their exchange got onto the internet was through one of his former business associates .
He said the rosary was recovered by an amateur diver on a 1715 shipwreck in Florida , and is slated for sale at the Sphinx auction house in London this autumn .
Anyone who tries to buy it from the internet site `` is going to be out some serious money , '' he added , because the rosary is not for sale on the internet .
Calls to the telephone number listed on the web site end in taped music .
Inquiries to the only address listed , an e-mail address , went unanswered .
`` There are more pirates today , '' Colombo said , `` than when all this stuff went down . ''
