CHILL OUT : FREON FOR OLDER CARS IS PLENTIFUL
( For use by N.Y .
Times News Service clients ) By BOB GOLFEN c.1998 The Arizona Republic
( Undated ) - Summer 's almost here , and once again drivers of
older cars are wondering whether there will be any Freon left to recharge their air-conditioners .
Not to worry , say Valley air-conditioning experts and mechanics .
The refrigerant is not only readily available but it 's actually cheaper than it was last summer .
`` The price is down and supplies are plentiful , '' said Ward Atkinson , a Scottsdale air-conditioning specialist .
Just a few years ago , the outlook seemed grim : production of the refrigerant R-12 , known as Freon , would ce ase in 1995 , forcing motorists everywhere to endure an expensive conversion of their automobile air-conditioners to use a new generation of refrigerant .
That 's because the world supply of Freon , a chlorofluorocarbon banned because of its suspe cted role in depletion of the Earth 's protective ozone layer , would disappear .
But that hasn n't happened .
Production of Freon is banned , all right , but instead of supplies evaporating , the refrigerant is readily available and should stay t hat way for years to come .
Atkinson credited the stockpiling of the chemical by automakers , dealers and mechanics ; an aggressive recycling program ; and reduced usage of R-12 as older cars are taken off the road .
`` All those things have r esulted in an adequate supply , '' Atkinson said .
`` Recycling cut usage tremendously . ''
Starting in 1993 , automakers began converting new cars from R-12 to R-134a , a new breed of refrigerant without the environmental hazard .
By 1995 , the entire new car and truck fleet was using R-134a .
But with hundreds of thousands of cars still using R-12 , it seemed that mechanics would reap a bonanza from retrofits to R-134a .
R-12 continues to be available , however , and drivers of R-12 equipped cars
are being urged to sit tight .
`` Our strongest recommendation is if it 's an R-12 car , continue to use R-12 , '' said Atkinson , who worked with the federal government in drawing up rules for banning R-12 production .
He said the only time an yone should convert to the newer refrigerant is if the AC system needs a big repair , such as a compressor failure .
Tempe mechanic and radio personality Mark Salem said he expects R-12 supplies to last beyond the life span of most R-12 vehicles .
`` I have access to R-12 for at least the next four years , '' Salem said , noting that Freon use by his shop has been tapering off since 1995 .
`` The real issue is that right now there 's a glut of 12 .
If the summer is short , and we have onl y three months of servicing air-conditioners instead of four , the bottom could fall out of market . ''
Last summer , hoarding and speculation caused the wholesale price of R-12 to spike to more than $ 600 for a 30-pound tank .
The gas was so valu able that smuggling from Canada , Mexico and overseas was becoming a significant issue .
This year , the price is just more than $ 400 a tank wholesale , and about $ 40 a pound retail , with a typical AC repair using about 3 pounds .
About half of the
retail cost is federal tax , levied to discourage hoarding and to encourage conversions to 134 a , which now costs about $ 10 a pound retail .
Debra Margraf , executive director of the Service Station Dealers of Arizona , said her members are findin g it easy to get R-12 .
She urged that motorists steer away from the so-called drop-in refrigerants that have been formulated to take the place of R-12 .
The effectiveness is questionable in many of them , and they can n't be mixed with Freon or 13 4 a.
`` If you do have car furnished with one of these types refrigerants , basically your car is married to that shop , '' she said .
`` Other shops can n't service the system . ''
Atkinson said automakers and dealers stockpiled R-12 because of fear s that the supply would dry up before they could service cars and trucks under warranty .
Now that the warranties are up on most of these vehicles , the R-12 is becoming available .
The cost of conversions also has fallen , Salem said , as the indu stry develops parts and supplies that can be installed cheaply .
If a car does have a big repair , such as a seized compressor , then it can be converted to 134 a , which should add only about $ 100 to the total bill .
`` But don n't convert unless you have to , '' Salem said , `` because it 's not worth it and because they 're sitting on a huge stockpile of R-12 .
`` When should you retrofit ?
The answer has always been and continues to be , when you have a major system failure . ''
