Primakov Pressures Duma to Approve 1999 Budget
" Do you think the country can live without a budget in such a setting ?
Of course not .
The budget must be approved , " Primakov told reporters before delivering a speech at the Duma .
The prime minister earlier told President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin that the government " will not stay " in office if the p arliament does not approve the draft budget .
The State Duma was due to consider the budget in the first reading on Thursday .
The draft is intended to restore confidence among creditors that Russia is worth investing in .
While analysts have noted that rigor , many have questioned whether the targets and assumptions are realistic .
Primakov 's threat came after the Federation Council , or upper house of parliament comprising influential regional bosses , on Wednesday asked the Duma to postpone budget debates until more consultations were taken , casting a shadow over prospects of the program 's smooth passage .
The regional chiefs were unhappy that under the draft budget , more tax money would be moved from the regions to federal coffers .
The Communist Party , the largest faction in the Duma , and Our Home is Russia , another major player , have indicated their support for postponing the vote until next Tuesday .
The draft puts spending at 575.04 billion rubles , revenues at 473.67 billion rubles and the maximum budget deficit at 101.37 billion rubles or 2.54 percent of the GDP .
It also envisions a GDP of 4 trillion rubles and 30 percent inflation by the end of the year .
