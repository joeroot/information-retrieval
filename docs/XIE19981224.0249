Weizman Calls for Negotiated Israel 's Pullout From
JERUSALEM , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman has asked Lebanon to conduct peaceful negotiations with Israel on Israel 's troop withdrawal from South Lebanon .
Weizman made this call Wednesday afternoon during his inspection tour of the areas in northern Israel that were hit buy Katyusha rockets earlier in the day , according to Israel Radio .
Israeli army said that a total of 20 to 30 Katyusha rockets fired by Lebanese Hezbollah landed at Israel 's northern border town of Kiryat Shemona and the areas west of Galilee .
The Lebanese Hezbollah fired the rockets into Israel in retaliation for an Israeli air strike in Lebanon the day before that killed a Lebanese mother and her six children , aged between one and 16 .
Wednesday 's katyusha attack injured 14 Israelis and caused heavy property damage in Kiryat Shemona and other northern areas of Israel .
Israel has to find some way out to end such shellings and the best way is to conduct negotiations with the Lebanese government over the issue of Israel 's troop pullout from South Lebanon , Weizman said .
Local residents of Kiryat Shemona told the radio that the town was badly hit .
The cultural center , the central bus station and many houses were destroyed by the rockets .
" Many parents have kept their children at home Wednesday as asked by the school authorities , otherwise , terrible things could happen to the children if they and their schools were hit buy rockets , " one woman told the radio .
To prepare for the retaliation , Israel army has asked tens of thousands of local residents in the north to stay home on Wednesday .
Residents of northern boder towns and villages were instructed to stay in bomb shelters Tuesday night .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an urgent meeting of his security cabinet to discuss the attack , then flew to the north to inspect the areas that were hit during the attack .
He urged the local residents to remain calm and promised that the government will do everything possible to protect their safety .
The Israeli government and army have expressed their regret over the Tuesday killing of the Lebanese civilians , particularly the children .
Knesset ( parliament ) Speaker Dan Tichon even sent a condolence massage to the Lebanese family , expressing his sorry for the loss of lives of the family .
But Netanyahu 's communication advisor David Bar-Illan called the Hezbollah attack , the heavest one in three years , " totally unwarranted " and warned it could lead to an escalation of war in Lebanon .
Following the incident , Yossi Beilin , Knesset member from the Labor party , renewed his call for unilateral withdrawal of the Israeli troops out from the security zone in South Lebanon .
The Four Mothers , an Israeli peace group supports Israel 's pullout from South lebanon , also urged the army to withdraw from the security zone .
Israel set up in 1985 a so-called security zone in South lebanon .
since then , local resistance groups such as Hezbollah had been engaging in a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation .
