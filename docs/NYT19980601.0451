RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET FALLS MORE THAN 10 PERCENT ; BANKS ' RATINGS LOWERED ( JT )

MOSCOW _ Despite President Clinton 's effort to bring about an end to Russia 's financial crisis , the outlook continued to darken Monday .
The Russian stock market fell by more than 10 percent , and there were signs of strain among banks and in Russia 's young futures market .
The major test , however , will come on Wednesday when the government tries to sell eight billion rubles worth of treasury bills .
Analysts fear that the government will find it difficult to find buyers , further unnerving legions of jittery investors .
This is not what Washington had hoped for when Clinton said on Sunday that the United States was ready to support additional financial aid to Russia .
The International Monetary Fund said on Friday that it expected to disburse $ 670 million in assistance this month .
And the statement by Clinton was intended to underscore American support for an international effort that would go well beyond that , if needed .
Clinton 's statement contained no figures or details about how and when the additional assistance might be organized .
But the theory was the Clinton administration could could soothe investors simply by publicizing Washington 's willingness to help .
`` It was a very good statement , '' said Yegor Gaidar , the former prime minister who has been advising Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko .
`` It is exactly what the markets now need to hear . ''
But Monday the markets appeared to turn a deaf ear .
Investors said the slide reflected a number of factors , among them the vagueness of Clinton 's pledge .
Russia 's Central Bank has about $ 14.5 billion in reserves , about $ 10 billion of which is in cash reserves that can be readily spent to prop up the ruble .
Some Western bankers say Russia needs to have an international line of credit for an additional $ 10 billion .
`` There have been a lot of good words about potential actions , '' a European investment banker said .
`` But the fact is this market has been hurt so badly that words alone may not accomplish anything . ''
Beyond that , investors remained worried about the durability of Russian financial system , which is being rocked by the turmoil on the world 's financial markets .
Russia 's banks have lost huge sums in the stock market and are short of cash .
One leading bank , Tokobank , has already been place in receivership by the Central Bank , as bank officials and creditors try to negotiate a restructuring of its debt .
In particular , the banks are being squeezed by the Central Bank 's decision to hike interest rates to 150 percent , a move that was taken to discourage currency speculation .
`` To some extent the market is less worried about the solvency of the government than about the solvency of the banking system , '' said Tom Adshead , co-director of research at United Financial Group , based in Moscow .

Monday , Russian officials did their best to project an image of quiet competence .
Kiriyenko summoned foreign bankers to a meeting , where he promised to win parliamentary support for tax reform and lower corporate tax rates .
`` He let us know that he understood the situation was not just due to external factors , '' said a banker who attended the meeting .
`` He reiterated that there are internal actions that have to be taken . ''
To further mollify investors , Russian officials say the Central Bank has been gradually moving to expand its reserve .
Sergei Aleksashenko , the deputy chairman of the Central Bank , said the bank bought $ 400 million of foreign currency last week .
American officials praised the Russian government 's efforts and stressed that they were consulting with industrialized nations in the Group of Seven about how to help Russia .
Underscoring the need for industrialized nations to cooperate in developing an aid package for Russia , Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , speaking in Vienna , warned Monday that the economic distress in Russia could spread .
`` Russia 's problem has the potential to become in turn Central Europe 's and the world 's , '' Summers said .
Still , the somewhat distant prospect of additional help failed to boost Russia 's financial markets .
Brokers here said the trading on the stock exchange was minimal , because of a lack of buyers .
Russia 's futures market suspended trading after some participants failed to fulfill their obligations .
The exchange rate for the ruble slightly worsened , slipping 0.34 points to 6.172 to the dollar .
Aleksandr Potyomkin , a senior Central Bank official , said the government was counting on several sources to raise desperately needed revenue .
Loans from international financial institutions like the I.M.F .
and foreign governments , he said , were `` crucial . ''
Another source of funds is the auction of state property .
Kiriyenko signaled Monday night that he was pressing ahead with a new auction to sell the state 's Rosneft oil company .
The starting price will be $ 1.6 billion .
That is about $ 500 million less than the government had hoped for in last week 's auction , which was canceled for lack of bidders .
Beyond that , Russian officials are negotiating with foreign banks , which have been lining up to offer financing .
Russian officials , however , are apprehensive about the terms .
`` We have heard there are offers from five or six banks , '' a European banker said .
`` Most banks are of the view that Russia will eventually overcome this crisis of confidence by the investors . ''
In Moscow , Wednesday 's sale of treasury bills was emerging as an important test .
The government is trying to raise about 8 billion rubles ( $ 1.3 billion ) through Wednesday 's sale .
But that is an expensive way to finance the budget deficit .
Because the interest rates the government is offering are so high , some bills will be mature in seven days .
The Russian government has never before sold treasury securities for such a short period .
By doing so , the Kremlin is trying to buy time and line up lower-cost sources of financing .
Even so , some investment bankers , say the government may not be able to sell all the bills .
It would then have to dip into its reserves to buy some of its own securities .
`` If the Wednesday auction goes smoothly , we will have passed the most dangerous point , '' Gaidar said .
