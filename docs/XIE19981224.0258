UK Treasury Minister Becomes New Trade Secretary
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- British Treasury minister Stephen Byers was appointed on Wednesday to replace Peter Mandelson as Trade Secretary .
Byers was appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury , Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown 's number two , in the summer cabinet reshuffle .
He was formerly a junior education minister .
Byers , 45 , is closely allied to the modernizing wing of the Labour Party and one of Prime Minister Tony Blair 's rising stars .
Mandelson resigned earlier in the day following controversy over a loan he received from a fellow minister to buy a house two years ago .
Like Mandelson , Byers represents a seat in the north of England , an area badly hit by the manufacturing downturn and strong pound .
Byers was elected to parliament for Wallsend in 1992 , moving to North Tyneside , a prosperous suburb of Newcastle , in the 1997 boundary change .
He took a law degree at Liverpool Polytechnic and was a law lecturer at Newcastle Polytechnic before entering politics .
