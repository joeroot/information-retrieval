Italy Ready for Talks over Kurdish Leader 's Extradition
ROME , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Italy is ready to open " frank and friendly " talks with Turkey on Ankara 's request to extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan , Prime Minister Massimo D ' Alema said in a statement late Wednesday .
However , he said Italy would not give in to " unjustified " pressure to extradite Ocalan , leader of Turkey 's outlawed Kurdistan Workers ' Party , whom Ankara brands as a " terrorist " in leading armed campaigns for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey .
" There is no point in demanding that Italy hand over Ocalan .
We have laws and we can not hand him over to anyone , " said D ' Alema .
Noting that it would be unacceptable to place Italy on a par with terrorism , he asserted that his country " does not want to assist terrorist activities in any way . "
Ocalan was arrested by police on international warrants on his arrival at Rome 's international airport from Moscow .
He has requested political asylum and is now detained in a hospital in Palestrina , a town outside Rome .
Turkey has demanded his extradition to face trial for treason charges while thousands of Kurds from across Europe have arrived in Rome in the last few days to show support for Ocalan .
