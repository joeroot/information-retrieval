Zambian Opposition Officials Join Newly-Founded
LUSAKA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Five officials from three opposition parties in Zambia have resigned to join the newly-formed United Party for National Development ( UPND ) led by presidential aspirant Anderson Mazoka , Times of Zambia reported Thursday .
Lima Party ( LP ) chairman for information and publicity Stanford Hlazo , Lusaka province chairman Stanley Ngwenya and secretary Lewis Kayokolo have joined the UPND formed last month , said the daily newspaper .
Charles Chibanda , former central committee member of the United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) , and Stanley Habasonde , secretary general of the Zambia Democratic Congress ( ZDC ) , also joined the UPND .
The five announced their resignations here on Wednesday and were officially welcomed by UPND provincial chairman Joseph Chilengi .
Hlazo , who was also former parliament member of the country 's ruling party , said he has decided to join the UPND because the LP is elitist and has failed to penetrate the grassroots .
Chibanda urged other UNIP members to join the UPND as the current leadership under former president Kenneth Kaunda has nothing to offer .
