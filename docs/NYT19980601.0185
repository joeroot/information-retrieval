A WEAKER YEN COULD ACTUALLY HELP , NOT HURT , JAPAN 'S ECONOMY

For years , the yen was one of the world 's strongest currencies .
No longer .
This week it hit a seven-year low of YEN 138 against the dollar _ 40 percent down on three years ago .
To some , this is yet more evidence of Japan 's deepening economic mess , and a bad harbinger for the outside world , too .
Worries that a falling yen could prolong Asia 's financial crisis have helped push Wall Street sharply lower .
Yet such sentiments are misplaced .
The weaker yen will not be a cure-all , but it is likely to do more good than harm .
Which is more than can be said for the measures that would be needed if policymakers were to set out to make it stronger .
The recent fall in the yen largely reflects the relative stance of monetary policy in Japan and the United States .
American interest rates are likely to rise over the next year to keep inflation in check , while the Bank of Japan is expected to ease policy .
There is little scope for it to reduce interest rates much further from their historic low of 0.5 percent , but the bank could still spur the economy by , in effect , printing massive amounts of money .
This , in turn , implies a weaker exchange rate .
To achieve a stronger yen would require higher interest rates and monetary contraction : the opposite of what Japan needs .
A cheap yen will bring three benefits to Japan .
First , it will boost exports and so help to offset feeble domestic demand .
Second , by helping to push up import prices a weaker yen will make deflation less likely .
Japan is currently in danger of entering a deflationary spiral in which falling prices swell the real debt burden of companies , which adds to the problems of the banking sector , which further depress demand and so prices fall lower still .
And , lastly , a cheaper yen will lure new capital into Japanese equities and property , helping to ease one of the financial sector 's biggest problems .
From this point of view a fall in the yen should be cheered not feared .
However , many policymakers and commentators in both America and Japan are less than enthusiastic .
They warn of two adverse consequences .
First , that a lower yen could trigger another round of financial-market turmoil in the rest of East Asia .
There are some grounds for this , but only if the yen were in free-fall rather than in a fairly steady slide .
A collapse would indeed unsettle other Asian markets , and avoiding that is a legitimate policy objective .
But a slide is another matter entirely .
For Japan 's very economic weakness is one of East Asia 's main problems : fresh growth in Japan , and prevention of deflation , are powerfully in other Asian countries ' interests .
The second common objection to a weak yen is that it will widen Japan 's trade surplus and so reignite demands in America for protectionist measures .
It is true that by most measures , such as purchasing-power parity , the yen has already fallen below its `` equilibrium value . ''
Partly as a result , Tokyo , once the most expensive city in the world , now seems fairly reasonable to a visitor compared with New York , say .
It is striking that a Big Mac hamburger now costs about 30 percent less in Tokyo than in midtown Manhattan .
This might suggest that the yen-dollar rate has already overshot .
However , it is quite natural for weak economies to experience depreciating currencies and for booming economies to see rising ones .
Rather than the tumbling yen being more evidence of economic incompetence , the exchange rate is the mechanism that redistributes demand away from economies that are operating at full capacity towards those in recession .
Thus a strong dollar is also in the interest of America 's overheating economy right now as it is helping to keep down inflation .
This does not mean that devaluation will wipe away Japan 's woes .
Far from it .
There is still much that the government must do : implementing its latest fiscal stimulus , cleaning up the financial sector and deregulating many services businesses are vital for Japan 's longer-term economic health .
But if a cheaper yen contributes to economic recovery it will at least provide a healthier environment in which to carry out some painful structural reforms .
