LONG BEACH STATE SIMPLY RESILIENT
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By BOB KEISSER Long Beach Press-Telegram
& UR ; & LR ; OMAHA , Neb. _ The first rule of Dirtbag baseball is that nothing ever comes easy .
The second rule is that it takes someone tough to deal with rule number one .
And as editions of 49 er baseball go , the 1998 team has qualified as one of the toughest .
Sunday night , facing elimination here in the College World Series , the 49 ers dug themselves a 4 - 0 hole against Florida State but then rallied for a 7 - 4 win that gains them a rematch against Miami Tuesday night .
This is the team which began the season 2 - 8 and had its right to be known as Dirtbags questioned by Coach Dave Snow .
Qualifying for the CWS earned it a place in the Dirtbag Hall of Fame .
Staying alive in it moves it into more select territory .
`` We 've been resilient all season , '' said Snow afterward .
`` This is what I would call a good team win .
`` After they lost Friday ( to Miami ) , they came back with an attitude of no fear .
That was the perfect attitude , and the one I wanted to see .
They put it all on the line . ''
If Snow and his team were to ever win the lottery , it would take them three days to find the winning ticket .
But they would spare no sweat looking for it .
They 're like the best friend who is often late , but that you know will always show up .
Snow never gets tired of the one-step-back before two-steps-forward pattern , perhaps because college is supposed to teach character and tenacity in the face of adversity .
He 's found that it works for him personally and for his teams .
`` I just keep looking at the back of my shirt to see if it 's wet from the paint on the wall , '' he joked .
`` This team is starting to remind me of the 1993 team ( which came an inning away from playing in the CWS title game .
`` It has a certain teamsmanship , and they feed off of that . ''
Sunday 's game proved that point over and over again .
It started with Snow .
He posted a lineup early in the day , but changed his mind once he got to Rosenblatt Stadium .
The wind was blowing out to right field , so he inserted Mike Hota into the DH spot in place of Jason Berni .
It mattered not a bit that Hota had started two games all season .
Snow wanted an extra left-handed bat in the lineup with the wind blowing to right .
Naturally , Hota winds up driving in two runs with a bases loaded single in the fifth .
`` I found out about an hour before the game , '' said Hota .
`` But the coaches had told me to be ready to swing the bat with the wind blowing out . ''
Then there was the decision to start Scott Redfox at second base .
That was a no-brainer , Snow said , because he felt the need for more offense after watching all the batting thunder in other games .
But even he didn n't expect what he got .
Redfox , with one home run all season , took a 3 - 2 fastball over the right field fence for a three-run home run in the seventh that proved to be the difference .
`` I only hit home runs in batting practice when the wind is blowing out the way it did tonight , '' said Redfox .
The 49 ers also pulled off a delicious pick off play in the seventh that stopped a Seminole rally dead .
First baseman Jason Yount , with two extra base hits in his last 23 games , homered in the fourth and made two great defensive plays .
The way the team hung in emotionally , too , after leaving the bases loaded in the fifth and sixth also proved crucial .
`` The dugout is huge for us , '' said Hota , who has spent most of his 49 er career coming out of the dugout as a pinch-hitter and utilityman deluxe .
`` We get a lot of our energy from the guys on the bench who always stay in the game .
`` This team likes to do the small things .
Like , we thrive on guys getting hit by a pitch . ''
`` After those two innings , '' said Snow , `` I noticed the dugout didn n't letdown or get frustrated .
There 's a mentality this team has : it accepts what happens and goes on to the next thing . ''
The next thing is Miami , again .
The nervousness the 49 ers showed in their opener has now dissipated fully .
In the last four innings Sunday , the Dirtbags were having fun playing ball and getting their jerseys dirty .
`` That 's the great thing about this series , '' said Snow .
`` Guys who have played minimal rules get a chance to come up big .
But it 's too early to start calling anyone stars or heroes .
We won just one game . ''
That 's tough love .
But then it 's a tough team .
