''
By FRANK SANELLO ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & HT ; In the late-night talk-show wars , basketball superstar Earvin `` Magic '' Johnson has already won an important battle .
& HT ; The challenge : getting other superstars to appear on his syndicated show , which debuts June 8 on Fox affiliates nationwide .
& HT ; The pilot , which will not air but was used to market the show , featured a Triple-A guest list of Mel Gibson , Cher , Laurence Fishburne , singer / songwriter Babyface and supermodel Tyra Banks .
Oh , and unannounced and unscheduled , lightweight boxing champ Oscar De La Hoya dropped by to say hello to a favorite fellow athlete .
& HT ; `` When you have a superstar host , it 's a lot easier to book superstars as well , '' says executive producer Geovanni Brewer , a former documentary filmmaker for the Ford Foundation .
& HT ; A whole lot easier , actually : Harrison Ford , the Howard Hughes of celebrity interviewees , was making a reluctant appearance on Jay Leno to promote a film when he heard music he loved coming from next door .
Told it was Sheila E. conducting the band for Magic Johnson 's upcoming talk show , Ford _ who normally would rather undergo root-canal work than volunteer to be interviewed _ asked if he could be on the show .
& HT ; `` I 've always wanted to meet him , '' Ford said , according to Brewer .
& HT ; The executive producer says that the Lakers legend hasn n't abused his position as the athlete everybody _ including celebrities _ wants to meet .
When Johnson meets a star at a sporting event , `` he has to bite his tongue '' not to pitch an appearance on the show , Brewer says .
But he only buttonholes `` close personal friends '' to sit on his couch , leaving the grunt work of bagging Gibson and company to the talent coordinators .
& HT ; `` He doesn n't want to put anybody on the spot , '' she says .
& HT ; Johnson tells a different story , though .
& HT ; `` I 've called everybody , '' he says on the telephone from his office on Paramount 's back lot in Hollywood .
So far , he reports , he 's received only two rejections , `` and that 's because they don n't do talk shows , period . ''
& HT ; Johnson refused to name names , but laughed when asked if the `` no-shows '' were Salman Rushdie and Monica Lewinsky .
& HT ; Johnson 's roster of advisers is as star-studded as his guest list , representing the Tiffany 's of Talk .
Jay Leno 's `` Tonight Show '' occupies a competing time slot in much of the nation , but nevertheless Leno has become `` The Magic Hour 's '' unofficial `` dialogue coach . ''
& HT ; `` Jay told me to relax , make it my space , '' Johnson says .
`` Make the show fit my personality .
Don n't do things that aren n't me , like trying to get up there and do a monologue .
That 's not me . ''
& HT ; Instead , Johnson will open each show with a casual discourse more in the spirit of Andy Rooney than of Andrew Dice Clay _ `` not a monologue , '' he hastens to add , `` but something that happened to me that day or something in the news , just my perspective on it . ''
& HT ; Then a professional comic _ who at the time of this interview hadn n't been named yet , with two finalists vying for the job _ will trade a few quips with Johnson and finish with a polished monologue without the host 's participation .
& HT ; `` The Magic Hour '' tapes on Stage 29 at Paramount .
The location has special resonance for Johnson , since another African-American , Arsenio Hall , set up couch on the same sound stage and for five years gave Johnny Carson a run in the ratings .
& HT ; Hall has also helped Johnson get launched .
His advice was similar to Leno 's , the former athlete says : `` Have fun .
Let my personality come out , and don n't worry about what people say , because if you make it your show , it 's going to happen and people will like it .
But if you try to please people or make it somebody else 's show , it won n't work . ''
& HT ; Johnson has attacked the talk-show game the same way he attacked that other game which made him one of the most beloved figures in America , a three-time NBA most valuable player and member of five championship teams : He works out a lot .
& HT ; `` I 've been practicing for a year , '' he says .
`` It 's like being a rookie , something you 've never done in your life , so I 've had to learn technique and how to do these things . ''
& HT ; Besides freebies from Leno and Hall , Johnson is also aided by an interview coach and a speech therapist .
The interview expert helps him `` form '' questions , he says , even offering tips on how to interrupt a rambling guest to go to a commercial .
& HT ; Making his interview chores easier , executive producer Brewer suggests , is the fact that many stars have told her that they themselves have questions they have always wanted to ask Magic .
& HT ; `` A lot of times , '' Brewer says dryly , `` he 's a bigger star than his guest . ''
& HT ; Johnson has battled Larry Bird and Michael Jordan on the basketball court and the HIV virus in his bloodstream .
He says hosting a talk show is `` scarier '' than either of those opponents .
& HT ; `` I like scary challenges _ I thrive on that , '' he says .
`` That 's what keeps me working hard .
If you 're not scared , you don n't work hard .
Fear is a motivating force for me . ''
& HT ; The new combination therapy of AIDS drugs has cleared the HIV virus from his system , Johnson reports , and he has declared himself `` healed '' _ not cured .
The battle against his disease has turned into minor skirmishes , mostly when he forgets to take the fistfuls of protease inhibitors that have dropped the virus to levels undetectable in his bloodstream .
& HT ; `` The virus is outta here , '' he says firmly .
& HT ; His business empire continues to grow , but for the time being the former athlete is leaving it to his advisers while he focuses on his new venture .
& HT ; That empire is impressive by any standards : Johnson owns a chain of successful movie theaters plus Starbucks and TGIF restaurant franchises in Los Angeles , Houston and Atlanta .
All are located in the inner city , where pessimists said such ventures would fail .
& HT ; Oh , and Johnson recently teamed with Janet Jackson to buy a bank _ which , like his first multiplex , is located in South Central Los Angeles , site of the devastating riots after the Rodney King verdicts in 1993 .
& HT ; The jock-turned-business-magnate will admit to no qualms about doing business in the ghetto , despite the reluctance of others to follow his lead .
& HT ; `` They read things , they got scared off , '' Johnson says .
`` But we 're the biggest consumers .
We 're very loyal people .
If you bring a first-class organization to the inner city , we will support it , even more so because a minority is involved .
They say , ` One of us owns this ! '' ' & HT ; On `` 60 Minutes '' recently , Johnson proudly noted that none of his businesses has ever been vandalized .
& HT ; Johnson has also teamed with his former agent , impresario Michael Ovitz , on an effort to bring a National Football League franchise to Los Angeles .
& HT ; Given all of these ventures , and the financial rewards they have brought him , some have expressed surprise that the former Laker is stepping into the crowded talk-show arena .
& HT ; The answer , Johnson says , is as simple as that he was bored .
In fact , he had already turned over the day-to-day operation of his business empire to the president of Magic Johnson Enterprises , because its success meant it was no longer challenging .
& HT ; Hosting a talk show is a new challenge , and Johnson welcomes it .
The biggest surprise so far , he says , is how much fun he 's having playing couch potato with celebrities .
Despite his own fame , he confesses that he 's always been something of a groupie , especially toward movie and rock stars .
& HT ; `` I 'm having a great time , '' Johnson says .
`` This is what I needed .
I just didn n't know I 'd have this much fun . ''
