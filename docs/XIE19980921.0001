KAMPALA , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni told listeners across the world via BBC Sunday evening that Ugandan troops will not pull out of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) until the situation there stabilizes .
He made the announcement in response to questions from foreigners .
Uganda will maintain military presence in Congo ( K ) as long as the matters there require .
His army will not stay there if the problem in Congo can be solved .
However , he failed to give a detailed plan for the withdrawal .
African leaders are very sensible and Museveni thinks that they will find a good solution to the problem , he added .
When asked about the cause for eruption of armed conflict in Congo , he said the Congolese is in a better position to answer the question .
As for the deployment of so many troops across the country and the burden of this deployment on Ugandan economy , he said if they did not take these measures , they would face worse problems .
The president also answered questions about the rebels of Allied Democratic Forces and the Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) which operate in the western and northern parts of the country respectively .
He asserted the LRA rebels suffered so much in battles with the government army that they shunned the government troops and began to attack soft targets like unarmed civilians .
