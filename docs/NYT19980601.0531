AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS TO ACQUIRE MONSANTO FOR $ 34.4 BILLION

NEW YORK _ In the largest deal ever in the pharmaceuticals industry , American Home Products Corp. announced on Monday that it would acquire Monsanto Co. for $ 34.4 billion in stock .
The combined company will be the nation 's top seller of prescription drugs and a world leader in insecticides and other agricultural products .
The company 's name brands also include such household names as Advil painkiller , Centrum vitamins and Nutra Sweet sugar substitute .
The deal surprised Wall Street , which had long expected American Home Products , based in Madison , N.J . , to sell its agricultural business instead of expand it .
Yet , by merging with Monsanto , American Home Products will be able to double its research spending to $ 3 billion annually , add several new drugs to its pipeline and bolster its position in genomics research , a process which uses genes to develop drug compounds .
`` We started talking recently and it made sense to put our companies together , '' said John Stafford , the chairman of American Home Products .
`` We will have a new company with global presence that can deliver the new ( Monsanto drug ) products to the market .
We 'll be number three or four in the world when it comes to pharmaceuticals , up from number six . ''
Investors reacted coolly to the deal .
Shares of American Home Products crept up 93.75 cents , to $ 49.50 , while Monsanto fell 87.5 cents , to $ 54.50 .
Several factors may explain the muted response .
Officials from American Home Products said the acquisition would dilute the company 's earnings by 15 percent the first year and a lesser amount after that .
Although both companies described the deal as a merger of equals , American Home Products is in effect purchasing Monsanto .
Under the terms , American Home Products will swap 1.15 of its shares for each Monsanto share and will control 65 percent of the new company 's stock .
`` American Home Products appears to be taking control of Monsanto , '' said Neil Sweig , a pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research Partners .
`` But the new board will be divided up evenly between the two companies .
It will be interesting to see how well the two companies integrate . ''
The acquisition may have averted a crisis at both companies .
Analysts noted that the deal , which would create a combined company with $ 96 billion in market capitalization and $ 23 billion in sales , would help American Home Products cover its legal liabilities over its diet drugs , Redux and Pondimin , one half of the combination known as fen-phen .
American Home Products recalled the drugs last September at the request of the Food and Drug Administration , after studies showed the pills could cause heart damage .
A flood of lawsuits from the 6 million people who used the drugs quickly followed , and analysts now estimate American Home Product 's liabilities could be as high as $ 5 billion .
Monsanto 's problems were not quite so dire .
The St. Louis-based company had recently spun off its chemical division to concentrate on agricultural products and biotechnology .
Yet , it had little chance of fully marketing its wares without merging with a company like American Home Products , a firm twice its size .
`` There is no doubt that the new company will be stronger , '' said Dr. Daniel Vasella , president and chairman of the executive committee of Novartis AG in Basel , Switzerland .
`` Strategy is nothing unless you can implement it properly but I believe they will succeed in combining the cultures . ''
Analysts appear to be more confident that the two companies ' portfolios will meld better than than boardrooms .
American Home Products and Monsanto are two of the world 's largest sellers of agricultural products , including Roundup , the world 's most popular herbicide , and namebrand insecticides like Counter and Fastac .
Even more important , however , both companies are well anchored in pharmaceutical and consumer products .
Monsanto sells Nutra Sweet , a popular sugar substitute , as well as Ambien , a leading treatment for insomnia , marketed through Searle , its pharmaceutical division .
As with any pharmaceutical acquisition , this one will produce a deep pipeline .
Monsanto has five drugs that should enter final stage of trials this year , while American Home Products could launch several top selling drugs within the next several years , including Embrel , a joint venture with Immunex for rheumatoid arthritis .
Prior to the deal , both companies were outpaced by their competitors on research and development spending .
American Home Products spent $ 1.5 billion on research and development last year , while Pfizer spent $ 2 billion and Merck $ 1.683 billion .
Once the acquisition is completed , American Home Products and Monsanto will spend $ 3 billion annually on research _ $ 2 billion on pharmaceuticals and $ 1 billion on agriculture .
The company also expects to save $ 1.2 billion to $ 1.5 billion annually in cost savings within three years of the deal 's closing .
Yet , the deal also raises some hard questions .
The two companies have different cultures that may clash .
For example , the combined company has yet to be named and the two chief executives , Stafford at American Home Products , and Robert Shapiro at Monsanto , will run the company as joint chairmen .
In what appears to be a further ingredient to a corporate turf battle , the company 's top four jobs are divided equally between the two companies .
Robert Blount , a senior executive vice president at American Home Products , will be the new company 's chief financial officer .
Robert Essner , American Home Products executive vice president , will head the pharmaceuticals business .
Monsanto Vice Chairman Richard U. De Schutter will run the consumer health care and nutrition division and Hendrik Verfaillie , Monsanto president , will run the agricultural and animal health businesses .
