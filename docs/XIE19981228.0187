Sri Lanka Enjoys Record Earnings from Expatriates
COLOMBO , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Sri Lanka 's earnings from private remittances have topped 710 million U.S. dollars for the first nine months of this year , a 12.7 percent growth over the same period last year , officials said Monday .
" Most of these earnings have come from the expatriate community , " said a Foreign Employment Bureau official , adding that there is an increasing demand for Sri Lankan skilled labor from many countries .
Private remittances have now become a major foreign exchange earning source for the Sri Lankan economy and the expatriate community contributes the lion 's share of these earnings .
The Middle East countries are experiencing an influx of housemaids from Asian countries .
The Foreign Employment Bureau is therefore encouraging Sri Lankan skilled workers to go for foreign employment .
A national policy introduced recently to register every person leaving for foreign jobs has helped the bureau to maintain statistics .
