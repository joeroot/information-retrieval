Nepal 's Special Parliament Session Ends Quickly
KATHMANDU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The special parliament session of Nepal which convened Thursday lasted less than one hour since the no-confidence motion for which it was called had lost its target .
Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel told the Lower House session that " after the resignation of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala , there is no meaning of the special session . "
Rajendra Pandey from the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxism-Leninism , CPN-UML ) , Koirala 's new ally , agreed .
He also said that the Communist Party of Nepal ( Marxism-Leninism , CPN-ML ) can not claim itself as the opposition leader in parliament .
Speaker Poudel said that the CPN-ML , the third largest with 40 seats in the 205-member house , can be the opposition party because they were also elected from the people .
Bam Dev Gautam , general secretary of the CPN-ML which led in moving the censure motion Sunday against Prime Minister Koirala , acknowledged that the role of the special session was limited due to the resignation of Koirala .
But he claimed that Koirala resigned under the pressure of the no-confidence motion .
Under the agreement reached Sunday with the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxism-Leninism , CPN-UML ) , Koirala resigned Monday to pave the way for the formation of a new coalition government under his leadership to conduct general elections by March / April 1999 .
He was reappointed prime minister Wednesday by King Birendra and administered oath of office Thursday by the king .
On December 11 , Koirala recommended to the Royal Palace to dissolve parliament for fresh polls on March 31 , 1999 following the withdrawal of the CPN-ML from his coalition the day before .
But 62 lawmakers from the CPN-ML and its supporters made a submission the same day calling for a special session of parliament to discuss their planned no-confidence motion against the NC minority government .
King Birendra accepted the submission and called the special session Thursday .
