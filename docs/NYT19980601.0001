NEW YORK _ Kenneth Joseph Lenihan , a New York research sociologist who helped refine the scientific methods used in criminology , died May 25 at his home in Manhattan .
He was 69 .
The cause was a heart attack , his family said .
Lenihan retired in 1995 as an associate professor of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice .
He had joined the faculty in 1980 , after earlier stints as a researcher at Columbia University 's Bureau of Applied Social Research , the Vera Institute of Justice in New York and the Bureau of Social Science Research in Washington .
He brought his expertise to the study of recidivism rates among criminal offenders .
He conducted a study in Baltimore , called the Life Project , for the U.S. Department of Labor in the early 1970s .
A large research project , it measured whether and how giving jobs or money to recently released offenders would affect the chances of their becoming repeaters .
That project and further studies formed the basis of a standard work in the field , which he wrote with P. Rossi and D. Berk , `` Money , Work and Crime '' ( Academic Press , 1980 ) .
Lenihan was born in Queens , and graduated from Columbia 's School of General Studies in 1960 .
He also earned his M.A .
and Ph.D .
in sociology at Columbia , the latter in 1974 .
Lenihan is survived by two sons , Andrew of Miami , and William of Manhattan ; a daughter , Jean Lenihan of Seattle ; four sisters , Eileen McEwan of Houston , Moira Earhart of North Carolina , Jean Dobson of Bay Shore , N.Y . , and Sue Adams of Cape May , N.J . ; and three grandchildren .
