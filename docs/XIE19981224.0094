Australian Dollar Closes Lower on Eve of Christmas
CANBERRA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The bearish commodity price outlook and an illiquid market conspired to push the Australian currency lower Thursday .
After dipping to a two-and-a-half month low in offshore overnight trade the Australian dollar closed at 61.03 U.S. cents , still weaker than Wednesday night 's close of 61.39 U.S. cents .
Paul Macarounas , senior foreign exchange manager of Rothschild & AMP ; Sons , said the Christmas Eve market conditions are very illiquid and thin .
Macarounas said the fact that the Australian dollar broke 61.00 U.S. cents and traded at 60.90 U.S. cents and then didn n't continue to fall intrigued him a little .
The Australian dollar closed at 70.52 Japanese yen from 71.41 yen and 1.0228 German marks from 1.0249 marks .
Strength in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar offered the local currency some support .
Macarounas said the Australian dollar was characterized by the continuing story of softer metals , especially gold .
