2 AUSSIES LOCK UP ALCATRAZ VICTORIES BY DAN GIESIN
TRIATHLON-SFCHRON c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle
SAN FRANCISCO _ It was something old , something new Sunday at the Escape From Alcatraz triathlon .
Chris McCormack , a rookie Escapee , held off fellow Australian Greg Welch to win the swim-bike-run competition in 1 hour , 59 minutes , 56 seconds , just six seconds in front of the defending champion .
Meanwhile , Michellie Jones , another Aussie , took control of the women 's competition on the eight-mile run leg and coasted to her second straight Alcatraz victory with a 2 : 12 : 55 clocking , nearly a minute and a half ahead of runner-up Barb Linquist of Wilson , Wyo.
McCormack 's and Jones ' victories were in the come-from-behind category , and it was the opening swim phase , a 1.5-mile trudge through the waters of San Francisco Bay , that separated the two from the other competitors .
`` That was a hard swim , '' said McCormack , a 25-year-old from the Sydney area who has been competing in triathlons for four years .
`` I didn n't know where I was .
I got lost , and I didn n't know where to go .
I was really annoyed .
I spent the whole swim alone . ''
When McCormack finally emerged from the Bay , he was in sixth place , nearly a half-minute behind Welch , who led the record field of 759 competitors into the 18-mile bike leg .
But McCormack put the hammer down , and finally caught Welch and co-leader Wes Hobson of Boulder , Colo. , a couple of miles from the end of the leg .
The three men were stride-for-stride heading out for the deciding run from the Marina Green to Baker Beach and back .
Hobson , who had overtaken Welch during the bike phase and actually had a small lead before being reeled in , was the first to drop off the pace during the run .
`` About two miles into it , Greg put on a small surge and Chris went with him .
I didn n't , '' said Hobson , who faded to fifth place overall , 3 : 22 behind McCormack .
Welch , whom two-time champion Mike Pigg once referred to as `` a thoroughbred on the run , '' then tried to ditch McCormack , but the younger Aussie wouldn n't have it and the two headed into the final 200 meters dead even .
But McCormack took an inside track around the final corner , and Welch found himself at a disadvantage and , ultimately , out of the running .
`` I picked up the pace at Crissy Field , and I thought I would be better off , '' said Welch , who also won this event in 1992 .
`` But he kept with me , and when we came into that turn I was out of position .
I didn n't try to catch him , because I knew I was going to come in second anyway .
No use busting a gut . ''
Although Jones didn n't have to bust a gut , she had to work to overcome Linquist 's huge early lead , which was nearly two minutes at the end of the swim leg and 1 : 45 before the run .
But in a situation that nearly duplicated the 1997 event , Jones grabbed the lead at the four-mile mark of the run and coasted to her second straight Alcatraz win .
`` Barb definitely has a weak leg and that 's the run , '' Jones said , seemingly oblivious to the pun .
`` I knew I just had to be patient until I took over .
And I caught her at exactly the same spot as last year .
I was just like deja vu . ''
Linquist , a former All-America swimmer at Stanford , once again put her finely honed swimming ability to good use , coming out of the water 34 seconds behind Welch .
She maintained her advantage over Jones through the bike leg , but it didn n't come easily .
`` I think it 's easier for me to have a carrot out in front , '' Linquist said .
`` Every spot that I could have eased up ...
I had to tell myself to keep pushing .
I had to tell myself that every five seconds counts . ''
But Jones , perhaps the best all-round female triathlete , gobbled up those precious seconds on the run , and when the inevitable happened , all Linquist could utter was a good-natured `` oh nuts . ''
`` I was trying to hold her off longer than last year , '' Linquist said .
`` Because I knew that unless something bad happened , I wasn n't going to catch her .
Her strength is she doesn n't have any weaknesses . ''
& LR ; & UR ; NOTES : & LR ; The choppy waters of Bay played havoc with two race favorites .
Pigg , who won 79 of the 141 races he entered from 1987 - 1996 , suffered through the opening phase , coming out of the water 2 : 06 behind Welch and about 20 racers down .
`` I took some time off when my twins were born ( last December ) , and I haven n't got the miles in .
I was playing catch-up all day , '' said Pigg , who finished in seventh place .
Sian Welch , Greg 's wife , said the cold water affected her feet , which in turn affected her bike leg and part of the run .
`` I had problems getting my feet warm , '' said Welch , who finish sixth , more than seven minutes behind Jones .
`` I was a little sluggish until four miles into the run . ''
The top amateur finishers were a couple of Bay Area folks : Peter Kain of Half Moon Bay was 10th overall , while San Francisco 's Michelle Deasy was eighth among the women .
