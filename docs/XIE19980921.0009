Holyfield Wins Decision over Bean
WASHINGTON , September 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Evander Holyfield beat a tough Vaughn Bean with a decision win in the heavyweight boxing title fight on Saturday night in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta , the United States .
Holyfield , looking at times like an old fight , knocked Bean down in the 10th round and won a unanimous decision over the challenger before 41,357 home fans .
While Bean was fighting only his eighth opponent with a winning record , Holyfield showed guile that comes from long years of experience in the competition .
Bean pushed Holyfield into the ropes late in the 10th round when the champion suddenly sidestepped Bean and flung him into the ropes with his left arm .
Holyfield landed a right to his rival 's head that floored him for a seven-count .
" He hit me when I was down , " Bean said .
" The referee didn n't do his job .
I know I was on his hometown .
He hit me right on the temple .
The referee could have stepped in . "
" I 've got to take advantage of every opportunity I get , because he 's a good fight , " said Holyfield , who will bed 36 on October 19 . " I just turned and hit him .
That 's part of the boxing game . "
Bean was ranked No. 1 by the IBF and was Holyfield 's mandatory challenger .
Last March , Bean lost an IBF title bid against then-champion Michael Moorer on a 12-round majority decision .
This time the decision wasn n't close .
Judge Duane Ford scored it 116 - 111 , while Al De Vito and Leroy Brown each had it 117 - 111 for Holyfield .
Holyfield found the awkward Bean much tougher than most observers thought he would be .
" I didn n't come in overconfident , " Holyfield said .
" I hit him with good shots .
He also hit me with good shots .
You have to give the man credit .
The man came to fight .
He 's much better than people gave him credit for .
This was his day to shine . "
Holyfield earned at least 5 million dollars for his 36th victory against three defeats .
He had 25 knockouts .
Bean lost for only the second time against 32 wins .
His purse was 1.8 million for his second IBF title bid .
