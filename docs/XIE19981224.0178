Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to " Dissidents " in China ( 5 )
Opening comments readily reveal the inappropriate use of " dissidents . "
Individuals engaged in subversive acts in any country are arrested , tried and sentenced to prison according to laws of the respective nation .
Speech is free till it is anti-government in nature , with the United States being no exception .
Nationwide protests against the war in Viet Nam and demonstrations calling for freedom and equal rights for black people hit some 70 U.S. cities and rocked college campuses during the 1960s and early 1970s .
President Lyndon Baines Johnson decided to put down the anti-war movement which he described as anti-government .
Hundreds of thousands of people , including students , were arrested , injured or killed during related actions .
No specific statistics were reported .
Here are only two examples , 38 people were killed in July 1967 during four days of rioting in Detroit .
The Chicago police department employed fascist tactics and injured over 700 people and arrested over 650 others on August 29 , 1968 , during attempts to quell the anti-war movement .
The aforementioned example clearly show how the U.S. government deals with anti-government acts .
You might refute : " We are neither subversives nor anti-government .
We are , however , fighting for the freedom of democracy within a legitimate range . "
Therefore , you should be addressed as " different political viewers " ( DPV ) .
Why does the government of the United States refer to members of opposition parties in other countries as dissidents , but refrain from doing so in the U.S. itself ?
We should not accept the " dissident " title .
