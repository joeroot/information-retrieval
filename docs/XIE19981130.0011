20,000 Refugees Flee to Tanzania Since Congo
DAR ES SALAAM , November 29 ( Xinhua ) - Some 20,000 refugees from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and Burundi have so far entered Tanzania since a bloody crisis broke out in DRC early August .
" About 15,600 refugees are from the DRC and 3,800 from Burundi , " a spokesman for the Home Affairs Ministry here said Sunday .
The official said the arrivals have brought the grand total refugees from the two countries currently in the refugee camps in western Kigoma Region to 236 , 425 .
He said this includes the Congolese refugees who had been repatriated voluntarily from Kigoma camps under an exercise which was however halted on August 8 following the eruption of new fighting in the central African country .
" By the time the voluntary repatriation of Congolese refugees came to a halt , 27,075 refugees had been repatriated , " he said .
The Congolese refugees are fleeing battles taking place in the eastern part of their country between DRC government forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila and the rebels .
Claiming to be neutral in the DRC conflict , Tanzania recalled its military advisors from DRC almost immediately after the conflict broke out while other neighboring countries rushed their troops to either side of the conflict .
The war has so far already drawn in Angola , Namibia , Zimbabwe and Chad on Kabila 's side while the Tutsi-led rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda .
