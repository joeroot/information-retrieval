... people into refugees .
At the request of the government of Guinea-Bissau , Senegalese troops intervened .
The Community of Portuguese-speaking countries and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECWAS ) also stepped in to mediate .
Their efforts contributed to the signing of a cease-fire accord by the two conflicting parties and their agreement to hold new general elections in March 1999 .
By helping ending the Guinea-Bissau conflict , the ECWAS reasserted its precious role in solving regional conflicts following its successful interventions in the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone .
With more and more countries of different standpoints drawn into the conflict , the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo gradually escalated into one of Africa 's largest regional conflicts , making it even more difficult for a negotiated settlement .
Shortly after the Tusis started their armed rebellion against the Hutu-led government , President Laurent Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of secretly backing the anti-government forces .
To prevent the conflict from jeopardizing the stability in the Great Lake region , the SADC foreign ministers ' conference authorized Zimbabwe , Uganda and later Sudan and Chad to intervene militarily .
The African Unity Organization ( AUO ) , ECWAS , SADC and other African regional institutions also held a series of meetings to help create favorable conditions for a peaceful settlement of the crisis .
African leaders , including South African President Nelson Mandela , flew from place to place and spared no efforts in seeking a way out of the entangled crisis .
Although the desired outcome has not yet been achieved , their efforts are already yielding positive fruit .
The conflicting parties undertook , at a French-African summit in Paris in November , to stop hostilities immediately .
As a result of the patient mediations by regional and international organizations , pent-up rancors on the African continent , such as those between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between the warring factions in Somalia , are beginning to ease .
The AUO is due to hold an enlarged meeting of its central organs in Burkina Faso in the near future to address Africa 's peace and security problems .
Although one conference may not be adequate to find cures for all these chronic and sometime infectious problems that have plaqued the continent for so long , the world community has reasons to believe that an era of peace will eventually dawn on this continent , so long as its leaders demonstrate their political will and wisdom for the purpose .
