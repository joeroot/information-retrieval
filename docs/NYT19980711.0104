NEW , RELAXED PARCELLS IS STILL RARING TO GO

New York Jets coach Bill Parcells ' cardiologist was on the sideline watching practice during the recent minicamp for rookies .
But Parcells , a man who has undergone several heart procedures , was not discussing his various surgeries with Dr. Michael Kesselbrenner .
Instead , the 56-year-old Parcells was captivated by Kesselbrenner 's 12-year-old son , Joey .
`` The kid 's hitting . 625 in the Fair Lawn Little League , '' Parcells said with admiration .
`` When I was playing in Hasbrouck Heights , I only hit . 611 . ''
It 's not quite football time yet , but Parcells seems as if he is in the sweet spring of his coaching career .
Asked whether he felt pressure to do even better than last season , when he helped engineer one of the great football turnarounds _ the Jets rebounded to 9 - 7 following a franchise-worst 1 - 15 _ he replied simply : `` I do feel challenged .
I don n't feel pressure .
I think the word is anticipating , not pressure . ''
The Parcells that players see these days is someone who doesn n't work late into the night , as he did in his New York Giants days .
He tries to get to bed by 10 p.m. Once upon a time , that 's when his meetings with the coaches began .
`` I won n't watch films late at night anymore , '' he said .
And every morning he is on the treadmill .
Sometimes he 's there at 7 a.m. , sometimes before noon .
But always there is 1950s music blaring _ Dion and the Belmonts , or Little Anthony and the Imperials .
Parcells has learned to relax .
He is spending these last days before training camp at his ocean-view mansion in Sea Girt , N.J .
When camp begins , it will be tough , as usual .
That has not changed .
He concedes it is probably more physical and demanding than most other coaches ' .
But what drives him so hard , now ?
Why is he itching to fight the fight , when three years ago he told New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft that he was so concerned about his health that he wanted to cut a year off his contract ?
`` I always tell my guys , and I 've always heard it , '' he said in an attempt at an answer , `` ` When the other team comes out of the huddle and you don n't want to hit them again , give up the game . '' '
He has tempered that aggression , though , with the realization that he must take care of himself .
So he has left Mike Tannenbaum , his contract-signer , back in the Jets ' complex at Hofstra University , to work on the draft picks .
He told his coaches to take off .
Bill Belichick , his alter ego , is headed for a villa near Tuscany .
Parcells says he has so many more things in place this year compared with last , when he charged in on his white horse and had to bend an entire franchise to his will .
The Parcells the rookies saw every day last week was the springtime Parcells , though .
Thus , Scott Frost , the subject of the great experiment ( can a quarterback for co-national champion Nebraska be turned into a strong safety ? ) , heard only a mild rebuke when he was injured early in minicamp .
Frost turned his ankle .
As he was getting it taped , Parcells chided him : `` Frost , that 's what I get for drafting a quarterback and trying to make him a safety .
He gets himself hurt the third day of practice .
Without pads on . ''
In a little more than a week , the meaning will be the same for Frost , but the words may come in a summer fury .
