Netanyahu Pans Labor 's Stance in Peace Process
JERUSALEM , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- With an eye on the coming early elections , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday criticized the stance taken by his rival opposition Labor Party in the peace process .
At a gathering of the Central Committee of the ruling Likud party , Netanyahu said that the former governments led by left-wing Labor gave too much to the Palestinians in peace talks but got nothing in return .
Netanyahu stressed that he would stick to the principle of reciprocity , and that only after the Palestinians " give , " will they " get . "
He reiterated that he would not go ahead with the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank until the Palestinians met his demands over issues concerning unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood and their fight against terrorism .
In response , Labor leader Ehud Barak told Israeli TV Channel One that Netanyahu was leading the country to a " disaster " and his government was doomed to fail .
But he said that he would not make concession over the final status of Jerusalem , adding that Jerusalem is Israel 's undivided capital .
Last week , Israeli Knesset ( parliament ) passed the first reading of a bill calling for early elections , which could be held in a few months .
Both Netanyahu and Barak have already kicked off their election campaign .
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told Likud members that he will not run for the premiership .
The hawkish leader hailed Netanyahu as the best candidate to lead Israel in the peace process .
Meanwhile , the Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat said Sunday that Israel was using the elections as an excuse for not withdrawing troops from the West Bank .
Noting that Israel had completely halt the peace process , Arafat called on Israel to honor the latest land-for-security accord .
Netanyahu suspended the second stage of troop pullback citing Palestinian violations of the Wye accord over statehood and crackdown on anti-Israeli violence .
Since the Wye accord was signed in October , Arafat has on several occasions said he will declare , with or without agreement with Israel , an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital in May 1999 .
