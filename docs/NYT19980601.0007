REACTION MIXED IN TOWN WHERE IMMIGRANTS LANDED

BAY HEAD , N.J .
_ Residents of this wealthy seaside community reacted Sunday with a mix of sympathy and flippancy as they learned that 22 Chinese immigrants landed here on Saturday night .
`` It 's so sad , '' said Kim Morris , owner of a fashion boutique that sells Lilly Pulitzer clothes .
`` They spend their life savings to get here , they survive weeks on a boat _ not that I approve of illegal aliens , but it 's sad .
They thought they were in Chinatown , and here they were running around Bay Head . ''
Michelle Hoy said that the immigrants had probably paid thousands of dollars to be smuggled into the United States .
`` You know how long it took them to make that money ? ''
Ms. Hoy said .
Others , speculating that the boat that was carrying the immigrants _ the Oops II _ had made a wrong turn , noted the irony of economically desperate immigrants washing up in the borough of Bay Head , where expensive cars are parked in nearly every driveway .
`` It 's just perfect , '' Katie Dempsey said .
`` This is probably the most affluent town on the Jersey Shore . ''
Bay Head , in Ocean County , encompasses only 1.3 square miles and has a population of 1 , 100 .
Many residents referred to the immigrants ' landing as the `` Chinese invasion , '' and news of it swept through town faster than word travels when the sea bass are biting .
By early Sunday afternoon , after the Oops II had been towed from the beach , residents and tourists who stayed behind were doing their best to come up with a good rumor to explain its arrival .
Clayton Smith , whose house sits atop the dunes at the foot of Mount Street a few yards from where the Oops II ran aground , said he was sure the immigrants must have come from a `` mother ship '' somewhere offshore .
But he had another theory for why the boat ran so far up the beach .
`` They must have been chased by someone , '' he said .
`` No , here 's what happened , '' said Boyd Fletcher , visiting from Portsmouth , Va. `` They were supposed to be going on to New York .
They paid $ 5,000 a person to get here .
They had a contact on shore somewhere .
`` I 'm making it up , '' he added , `` but I also think it 's true .
I think it happens all the time _ people paying skippers of these boats under the table to bring them to this country . ''
Wyndham Anderson of Princeton Junction , who had brought the Fletchers to Bay Head , agreed .
`` They were looking for the subway , '' he said .
Holding her beach bonnet down to her ears with both hands in the wind , Lorraine Nowicki of Whiting said she was glad all 22 immigrants had been detained , but surprised that they had made it ashore .
`` Where are all the patrol boats that are supposed to be patrolling ? ''
she said .
`` I think it 's unfair that they should come here , make our money , and send it back to China , while we 're here starving anyway . ''
Tim Fitzgerald , a 15-year-old skateboarder , said he thought the whole thing was `` pretty crazy _ but it 's exciting .
Nothing much ever happens in this town . ''
To Harold Seickendick , enjoying a Budweiser at Marlins a restaurant on the edge of town , the landing of the Oops II was just a bother .
`` I fish off the Mount Street jetty .
That 's my spot .
And they ruined it , '' he said .
`` I went up to check the fish at 7 : 30 this morning , and it was all closed off with police tape . ''
He took another long sip of his long-neck .
`` It 's a pretty nice craft they wasted , '' he said of the boat .
`` The Coast Guard has it , huh ?
Is it going to be up for auction ? ''
