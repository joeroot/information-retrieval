THE BET : STRATEGY AS INTRICATE AS A DOUBLE HELIX

CHICAGO _ Ask Hendrik Verfaillie , president of the Monsanto Co. , about the benefits likely to emerge from the announcement on Monday of Monsanto 's proposed merger with the American Home Products Corp. , and he turns the clock back four years .
That was when executives in the agricultural chemicals operations of Monsanto and the American Cyanamid Co. talked about co-developing crops capable of surviving sprays of their competing herbicides but could not agree on how to split costs and profits of such an arrangement .
The talks failed .
Now , thanks to the acquisition by American Home Products of Cyanamid 's agribusiness last year , such roadblocks will not exist if the deal announced on Monday is completed .
`` That 's the most exciting part for me , '' said Verfaillie , who will head the combined agricultural operations of the merged company from St. Louis , where Monsanto is based .
New products that can attract premium prices from farmers , the faster development of drugs using biotechnology , crops designed to yield healthier food _ these are among the visions driving the Monsanto-American Home Products merger .
Behind them all , as Verfaillie 's anecdote highlights , is the realization that even big businesses such as Monsanto are having a hard time keeping up with the opportunities and challenges erupting from biotechnology research around the world as scientists unlock the secrets of genes _ the basic building blocks of all life .
The breakthroughs could lead not only to huge new markets , environmental benefits and more plentiful food around the world , but also , if mismanaged , to ecological disasters .
Monsanto has been among the world leaders in the race to create `` life science '' companies , enterprises driven by the assumption that food , drugs and a wide variety of industrial and energy products in the next century will be based on understanding how genes are structured and how they perform their functions .
It began investing heavily in research two decades ago , built the broadest commercial portfolio of genetically engineered agricultural products and continuously searched for alliances that would help it extend the fast-developing science not just through the food chain but into its pharmaceutical business .
Not seeing how its traditional chemical businesses could fit in , Monsanto unsentimentally spun them off into Solutia Inc. , now an independent public company .
`` Monsanto has to be given an A-plus-plus for execution of the biotech vision , '' said Sano Shimoda , who follows biotechnology 's impact on agriculture for Bioscience Securities in Orinda , Calif. `` They 've recognized that you can n't study things to death . ''
But each new investment _ the most recent was a decision last month to spend $ 4.1 billion for full control of two leading seed companies , the DeKalb Genetics Corp. and the Delta and Pine Land Co. _ has eaten into Monsanto 's near-term earnings outlook and raised anew the questions of how Monsanto could compete with deep-pocketed giants like E.I .
du Pont de Nemours and Novartis A.G .
of Switzerland .
`` To some extent , Monsanto 's stock price has been defying the laws of gravity , '' Shimoda said .
`` The earnings have been getting worse and worse as they continued investing . ''
Moreover , Robert Shapiro , Monsanto 's chairman and chief executive , had repeatedly conceded that G.D .
Searle , Monsanto 's pharmaceutical arm , was too small to execute the pharmaceutical end of the biotechnology vision on its own .
Researchers have been doubling the amount of information about genes and how they operate every 18 to 24 months , an expansion far too rapid for Monsanto to exploit on its own .
In the end , Shapiro was more willing to sell Monsanto than to step back from his vision of where science was driving it .
`` This shows investors how we are going to be able to turn the pipeline into earnings , '' Shapiro said in a joint interview with John Stafford , with whom he will be co-chief executive of the company , as yet unnamed , that will be created by the merger with American Home Products .
Analysts said the deal made sense from a research point of view .
The resulting company 's $ 3 billion budget will be major league by any standard .
With two-thirds of it concentrated on drugs , that spending is focused on the area where Wall Street sees more short-term promise than in agriculture .
And American Home 's biotechnology resources , including the ownership of the Genetics Institute , are strongest exactly where Monsanto has been weakest .
Still , some analysts who have followed Monsanto wondered why the company had not found a higher-profile partner than American Home .
Shapiro had certainly made it clear to every potential buyer that he was open to suggestions .
But other life sciences leaders seem to have decided that Monsanto is no bargain .
`` It 's not by chance that this was the deal announced , '' Dr. Daniel Vasella , president of Novartis , said , declining an invitation to express any interest Novartis might have in topping American Home 's offer .
Some farm groups , concerned with public acceptance of genetically altered crops and other products of biotechnology , said that merging Monsanto 's expertise with American Home 's experience marketing over-the-counter products like Advil and Chapstick might be beneficial .
`` We 're always concerned about further consolidation of suppliers , but , if anything , it 's a positive that Monsanto is aligning with a consumer-oriented company , '' said Mace Thornton , a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau Federation , which represents more than four million farmers .
At the same time , some analysts questioned whether the merged company might be seen as less focused than Novartis and the alliance of DuPont and Pioneer HiBred International , the largest seed company .
They also questioned Monsanto 's agreeing to sell itself while it is busy completing its recent seed company acquisitions and starting a joint venture to create and market agricultural products with Cargill Inc.
`` The timing surprised me , '' said Bonnie Wittenburg , who follows agribusiness for George K. Baum & AMP ; Company in Minneapolis .
`` Monsanto could lose some good people . ''
