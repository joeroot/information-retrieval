EDITORIAL : JAWBONING RUSSIAN MARKETS

The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday , June 2 :

You know you are on new economic terrain when the White House decides to rush out a pronouncement on Russia on a Sunday , not because of some impending Russian government action but in hopes of influencing financial markets to be more inclined to lend money to the Moscow government .
President Clinton 's efforts to jawbone Russian markets were , at least initially , no more successful than previous presidents ' efforts to talk up U.S. financial markets in times of crisis .
Panicked investors are not inclined to be reassured by vague promises of support , such as the White House offered when it said the United States would back `` additional conditional financial support from the international financial institutions , as necessary , to promote stability and structural reform in Russia . ''
The most important word in Clinton 's statement was `` conditional , '' and it points us toward the real game that is being played here .
The president is supporting the current international policy of delaying a large bailout until there is evidence of real reform .
In plain language , the United States and the International Monetary Fund want Russia 's government to prove that it can collect revenues even before the badly needed reform of the tax code makes its way through the Russian parliament .
Pressure in the opposition direction _ that is , for a bailout now _ is coming from the big investors who regret going into Russia and have driven down the Russian stock and government bond markets .
It is a dangerous and expensive game , but in the absence of a major collapse , Clinton is right to press for internal reform as a prerequisite for aid .
All that makes it important for Boris Fyodorov , the country 's new tax czar , to step up collections .
That means Russia will have to operate like a modern state in wringing taxes from the clearly profitable but politically protected enterprises that have managed to ignore the tax laws .
At the same time he must persuade people across Russia that the system is being administered fairly .
That will not be easy , particularly given the corruption in the tax service that Fyodorov spoke of on Monday .
The most hopeful sign for the Russian government on Monday came in reports that it was talking to a group of foreign financial institutions , including some from the United States , about an interim loan .
That could help to restore confidence , particularly if it is clear the money is being provided without any promises of a bailout from international agencies .
