Party and Government Organizations to Unlink from Firms
BEIJING , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- A high-ranking Chinese government official today reaffirmed that the business firms associated with the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , government organizations and the army will be unlinked by the end of this year .
" All commercial businesses will be cleared by the end of this year , and some will be reorganized and some others will be closed , " said Sheng Huaren , minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission , at a press conference held here today .
The remaining firms will be divided into two parts : financial institutions and non-financial ones .
The financial institutions will be supervised by the People 's Bank of China and the CPC Central Committee 's Financial Working Committee , and those non-financial ones will be supervised by the Large and Medium-sized Enterprises Working Committee under the CPC Central Committee .
Sheng gave a detailed time table for the separation , saying that by December 20 , the Party and government organizations will have to transfer their firms to local governments .
As for firms associated with the Army and the Armed Police , the deadline will be December 15 , and for the judicial organs , the transfers will have to be completed by the end of this year .
Sheng noted that preparatory work has been done for the unlinking , and the transfers are already smoothly underway in some areas , such as Tianjin and Shanghai municipalities .
He noted that the practice of associating these organs with businesses has harmed the Party 's image and has resulted in corruption .
China decided to make these separations in 1993 , said Sheng , who acknowledged that this job has not been done very well so far , though some achievements have been made .
