Demirel Calls for Formation of Government Soon
ANKARA , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on Sunday called on political parties in parliament to work for the formation of a new government .
His appeal came after Yalim Erez , an independent deputy and industry and trade minister , was entrusted by him on Wednesday to form a new government .
Erez came to the fore after Bulent Ecevit , the previous premier designate and leader of the Democratic Left Party , failed in his attempt to garner enough support in the parliament .
Erez has not begun to meet with any political figures to try his luck yet .
Demirel said that " at the moment nobody knows what kind of government will be formed and we should wait and be patient for a few days . "
Speaking at a year-end press conference here on Saturday , Demirel declared that he will not exercise his constitutional power to dissolve the parliament even after the January 10 deadline .
The Turkish constitution stipulates that the president could dissolve the parliament and establish an election government , if no new government could be formed with the vote of confidence in parliament within 45 days of the collapse of a government .
The minority coalition government led by Mesut Yilmaz was ousted by the parliament on November 25 over corruption scandals .
