FOYT SAYS BOAT 'S CAR WAS ` SABOTAGED ' BEFORE INDY 500
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By JOHN STURBIN c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
FORT WORTH , Texas _ Racing legend A.J. Foyt says the engine in Billy Boat 's Indianapolis 500 pole-winning car was `` sabotaged '' the night before the big race while locked inside his garage at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
And Foyt has not ruled out the possibility the tampering might have been an inside job , involving a team member .
`` Somebody did some sabotage on Billy Boat 's car , '' Foyt said during a teleconference previewing the Pep Boys Indy Racing League 's True Value 500 K night race at Texas Motor Speedway on June 6.
`` Somebody dropped red Loctite on the last two ( fuel injector ) butterflies on the left engine bank .
It run down the throttle shaft and locked the two butterflies solid . ''
Loctite is a liquid glue-type substance typically used to secure gaskets and bolts to metal surfaces .
Foyt said the problem was discovered when his crew attempted to warm up the Oldsmobile Indy Aurora V-8 in Boat 's No. 11 Conseco Dallara before the start of Sunday 's 82nd Indy 500 .
Boat , who won the pole at 223.503 mph , said there are eight injectors at the top of the engine , one for each cylinder .
`` The butterfly controls how much air gets into the engine , '' Boat said from his business , B&AMP ; B Fabrication in Phoenix .
`` Somebody put Loctite on the throttle shaft .
It just locked it up solid .
`` It 's almost impossible for it to happen by accident .
I can n't accuse anybody , but the circumstances of how it happened are just very suspicious .
It can be done in a minute .
You only have to do it in one little spot to lock up the whole thing . ''
Foyt said the engine had been run at 2 p.m. Saturday , after which the garage was locked and `` sealed '' at approximately 2 : 30 .
Foyt said Tommy LaMance , team manager of A.J. Foyt Racing and his nephew , and Craig Baranouski , Boat 's chief mechanic , were the first crewmen to arrive at the garage Sunday .
`` We knew somebody had went through , '' said Foyt , first four-time winner of the Indy 500 .
`` I don n't know if it was ( done ) from the outside or if it was somebody on our crew .
I guess there 's a lot of jealous people out there . ''
Foyt said he did not officially report the incident to the sanctioning IRL .
Brian Barnhart , the IRL 's director of racing operations , said the garages were locked at 5 p.m. Saturday .
Barnhart said the Speedway also provided roving security 24 hours a day during race week .
`` I don n't think there 's suspicion among the team , '' said Boat , who led the race 's first 12 laps but finished 23rd because of a faulty gearbox .
`` I 'm 100 percent confident that nobody in our organization would do that .
We got a good bunch of guys . ''
Ironically , Boat originally was declared the winner of last year 's True Value 500 K at TMS .
But the victory was overturned and awarded to Arie Luyendyk the next day after a scoring review by the U.S. Auto Club .
Foyt will take no chances with the cars of Boat and teammate Kenny Brack at TMS , where practice and qualifying are scheduled for Thursday .
`` We 'll lock ' em back in the transporters , is what we 'll do , '' Foyt said .
