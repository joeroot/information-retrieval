EU Exports to Slovakia Rise 50 % Yearly
BRUSSELS , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- European Union exports to Slovakia rose an average 50 percent a year in the past four years , reported Eurostat Tuesday .
The exports came to 3,995,700,000 ECU in 1996 , while the figure in 1993 was only 1 , 221 , 300 , 000 , said the EU statistical agency .
Key EU exports to Slovakia in 1996 were machinery , mechanical appliances , chemicals , and road vehicles which amounted to 31 percent of the EU exports in 1996 .
Slovakia 's main EU trading partners are Germany , Austria , Italy , France and Britain , which respectively account for 50 percent , 15 percent , 13 percent , 6 percent and 3 percent of the Slovakia-bound EU exports .
Eurostat said that the biggest export rise in the 1993 - 1996 period was registered in 1995 , when exports rose by 78 percent .
The rise is partially due to the EU enlargement program , though Slovakia was still not on the list of the first batch of invitees .
The 15-nation union decided last December to invite Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Cyprus , Slovenia and Estonia to start talks , scheduled for April , on admission to the EU .
