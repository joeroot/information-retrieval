COMMENTARY : BRAINLESS IN GAZA ( JT )
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
There was something so completely , utterly and ridiculously over the top about House Speaker Newt Gingrich 's trip to Israel last week that the trip actually becomes a useful object lesson .
It is rare that you see such an Olympic-quality , full-body pander for Jewish votes and campaign donations _ without any regard for U.S. interests or regional stability .
This trip was to pandering what a triple lutz is to ice skating .
Consider the context of Gingrich 's Israel trip : Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has presented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a fair-minded plan for satisfying Israel 's security needs and the Palestinians ' territorial requests , and to move the process into final-status talks .
Though the U.S. plan protects Israel 's security needs , it does not satisfy every fantasy of every extremist in Bibi 's Cabinet .
Therefore , Netanyahu has to choose : Go with the United States and Palestinians , and advance the process but lose part of his coalition , or hold his whole coalition and lose the process .
This is a hard choice for him .
Bibi does not want to be blamed for reigniting the conflict .
It would be Bosnia on the Jordan .
But he is obviously reluctant to confront far-right opponents of the plan , like Ariel Sharon .
( Why he won n't take on Sharon , I don n't know .
I 'd bet on Bibi in that debate . ) So Netanyahu keeps delaying and trying to squeeze even more out of the Americans and Palestinians , hoping for a deal that would be so overwhelmingly in Israel 's favor that Sharon 's complaints would be neutralized .
But this would make the deal impossible for Palestinians to swallow .
If the Clinton team has the courage to tell it like it is , and keep the pressure on Netanyahu , he will eventually accept the U.S. plan .
It is too much in Israel 's and his own long-term interest .
But he will avoid choosing as long as he can .
So what does Newt do ?
First he denounces Albright as an `` agent '' for the Palestinians .
Nice .
Then , while in Israel , he signals Netanyahu that if he decides to go with his hard-liners and reject the U.S. plan _ no problem : Newt will make sure Bibi suffers no penalty in Washington .
Newt 's message to Bibi was clear : If the process collapses , I 'll blame Bill Clinton , not you .
I will sacrifice the efficacy of American diplomacy for the short-term needs of Republican politics .
Could anything be more cynical ?
Gingrich also planned to lay the cornerstone for moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem , from Tel Aviv .
When the White House warned him this could trigger an explosion , he backed off , but he did declare Jerusalem `` the united and eternal capital of Israel '' _ in contravention of U.S. policy that Jerusalem 's final status should be negotiated by the parties .
I hope Jerusalem stays Israel 's eternal capital too , but to rub this in the face of Palestinians when the United States is trying to persuade them to accept other compromises is stupid .
But Gingrich 's pathetic performance was typical of this moment , when the illusion is widespread that the peace process is just about domestic U.S. politics , and who can mobilize Congress and the Jews the best .
But believe it or not , there is still a Middle East .
Out there , pressure is mounting to bring Iraq back into the Arab fold .
Saudi Arabia is trying to organize an Arab conference that would probably freeze Israel-Arab relations as long as the peace process is frozen .
The Hamas leader Sheik Yassin has just completed a triumphant money-raising tour of Arab capitals as part of his goal to wipe out Yasser Arafat and then Israel .
And Jordan is terrified that Netanyahu is going to reject the U.S. plan and make it impossible for Jordan to sustain its relationship with Israel .
We 've seen this sort of pro-Israel , muscle beach party before , where everyone thinks that the only reality is U.S . - Israel politics and that everyone else is a paper tiger .
It was 15 years ago , when on May 17 , 1983 , the Reagan team and Israel 's Likud government crammed down the throats of the Lebanese an unbalanced , totally pro-Israel plan for the withdrawal of most , but not all , Israeli troops from Lebanon .
But the May 17 agreement was never implemented .
The U.S. Marine compound in Beirut was blown up five months after it was signed .
And both the Marines and Israel had to pull out of central Lebanon unilaterally , at great cost and leaving an enormous mess .
