Low Price Level Expected to Continue in China
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese economic analysts expect low prices to continue and discount any threat from inflation at the domestic market next year .
Liang Youcai , an analyst of the State Development Planning Commission , predicts the retail price index will remain between 1.5 and two percent , with the consumer price index ranging from three to 3.5 percent .
Liang 's predictions are based on the respective 1.5 and one percent index levels for 1998 .
His estimates coincide with those of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences which projected the 1999 retail price index will range between 1.5 to 1.7 percent , along with a somewhat higher consumer price index .
China has recorded negative price growth for 11 types of commodities and five types of consumer goods since October 1997 .
By the end of October this year , the retail price index had fell by 2.5 percent on a year-on-year basis , and the consumer price index went down by 0.7 percent .
The figures represented China 's first substantial long-term price drop .
