CLINTON DROPS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CLAIMS

Times News Service
WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday dropped the claims of executive privilege he had invoked in the Lewinsky investigation , moving to reduce the prospect of a quick Supreme Court review in the highly charged constitutional clash between the White House and the independent counsel .
But the president continued to press claims of a lawyer-client privilege to sharply limit the questioning of Bruce Lindsey , one of Clinton 's closest confidantes .
And the Justice Department filed its intention Monday to appeal a lower-court ruling that ordered Secret Service agents to testify .
The legal maneuver over executive privilege , approved by Clinton at a meeting Monday morning with his lawyers , was an attempt by the White House to narrow its appeal so as to rob the Supreme Court of an opportunity for a fast review , as independent counsel Kenneth Starr has sought .
If the tactic works , it could prolong the legal wrangling between the president and the independent counsel for many months .
Moreover , there were fresh signs Monday that even if Starr ultimately succeeds in defeating the attorney-client claims , he would be unlikely to gain any incriminating evidence against the president from Lindsey .
In a footnote in the White House brief filed Monday with the Supreme Court , administration lawyers said that Lindsey , a close friend of the president 's for three decades , had already told the grand jury that he `` had no information that anyone had committed perjury or obstruction of justice . ''
Lindsey and many other senior and junior Clinton aides have been called before the grand jury that is examining whether the president or anyone else illegally sought to coverup Clinton 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky , a former White House intern .
The White House had argued in March that a broad array of questions asked of Lindsey and another presidential aide , Sidney Blumenthal , could not be answered because they intruded on the fundamental right of the president to get confidential advice from his aides , a principle enshrined in the law by the courts as executive privilege .
`` One can not overstate the intolerable threat that an unduly constrictive reading of the privilege poses to the president 's ability to get frank and candid advice from his advisors , '' the president 's lawyers said in court papers at the time .
`` President Eisenhower underscored the crucial role the privilege plays in promoting effective governance , going so far as to remark that , if confidential presidential communications were ` subject to investigation by anybody , ' it could ` wreck the government . ' ''
But the White House on Monday quickly dispensed with a discussion of executive privilege in its motion to the Supreme Court , saying only that the claim is no longer a controversy because a federal judge , while ordering the aides to testify , had confirmed that the president was entitled to such a privilege in some circumstances .
The White House already had filed a notice that it intended to appeal the federal judge 's decision , which said Starr 's need for the testimony of Blumenthal and Lindsey outweighed the privileges .
In response , Starr petitioned the Supreme Court last week for an expedited review .
Although Blumenthal must now answer the questions he had initially refused to answer about his conversations with the president , Hillary Rodham Clinton and others , the White House 's move makes a speedy resolution of the other privilege claims , already considered a longshot , even less likely .
By removing the executive privilege claims , the White House eliminated the constitutional questions that provided the most attractive issues for a Supreme Court review .
The full scope of arguments on both sides remains out of public view , however , with Starr and the White House filing some sections of their briefs under seal .
It would take a vote of five justices to grant Starr 's motion for an expedited appeal , and four justices to decide whether to hear the case at all .

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
Acting Monday under a Supreme Court deadline , administration lawyers told the justices that there was no pressing need to quickly consider the independent counsel 's petition .
The Court has traditionally bypassed the appeals court , the White House brief said , in `` cases presenting the most profound and compelling circumstances . ''
Generally , those have been `` cases of overwhelming national emergency , such as in times of war ; and cases where the courts below are in substantial disarray on highly important federal questions , and there has been development and disagreement among courts of appeals . ''
Such rare instances when the Court had accepted cases for expedited review include the 1947 seizure of the nation 's coal mines following labor disturbances ; the 1952 seizure of steel mills during the Korean War ; and the 1981 resolution of the case of Iranian assets seized by the United States to meet a diplomatic deadline in a deal that freed American hostages .
Lawyers in the independent counsel 's office would not comment .
In a speech Monday before a North Carolina group , Starr made some thinly veiled criticisms of the White House 's extensive use of privileges .
Inveighing against litigants who `` try to concoct new privileges , '' he said that the courts have properly concluded that government lawyers can not cloak their conversations in lawyer-client privilege in the face of criminal investigations .
`` If you want to expand an existing privilege , to apply it in a new or unusual area , then the place to go is Congress , not the courts , '' Starr told a gathering of the Mecklenberg County Bar Association in Charlotte , N.C .
`` The courts can not be in the business of creating new privileges from whole cloth .
And lawyers ought to tell their clients that . ''
Starr 's comments also appeared to be aimed at the recent effort by the administration to block the testimony of three officials of the Secret Service under a new kind of privilege the administration has claimed should prevent them from testifying about Clinton .
Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled last month that no such privilege exists , but the Justice Department filed its intent to appeal Monday .
But although the administration on Monday dropped the executive privilege appeal , the White House signalled in its brief that it might raise new claims .
`` The White House continues to have reservations that the procedures the district court followed and intends to follow as witnesses appear before the grand jury may inadequately protect the confidentiality of presidential communications , '' the lawyers wrote .
`` The White House will continue , however , to work with the district court to ensure that adequate safeguards are employed . ''
