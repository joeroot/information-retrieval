Clinton Cancels Trip to APEC , to Deal with Iraqi Crisis
WASHINGTON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday decided to stay home to deal with the Iraqi crisis instead of going to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) meeting .
White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart made the statement after an emergency meeting of the U.S. Presidential National Security Council at the White House over an earlier Iraqi decision to resume cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors .
Vice President Al Gore will attend the APEC meeting , which is to be convened in Malaysia .
Clinton , who is supposed to leave at 10 : 00 EST Saturday night " hopes " to complete the remainder of the trip which includes stops in Japan , South Korea and the U.S. territory of Guam , Lockhart said .
The U.S. reaction means that the crisis is still not over .
Pentagon sources said that actually the Pentagon has already issued the order to attack Iraq with cruise missiles .
But it was delayed after Iraq made the promise to comply .
Earlier , the Iraqi authorities announced that it will accept U.N. weapons inspections to resume without conditions and inspectors would be allowed to return immediately .
The Clinton administration made it clear that the Iraqi compliance should be unconditional and full , or face serious consequences .
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that the Iraqi promise is unconditional and met all the requirements of the U.N. Security Council resolutions .
Meanwhile , the first wave of additional U.S. warplanes left for the Gulf this morning : six B-52 heavy bombers departed Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana , at 4 : 38 a.m. EST .
The aircraft were to be followed shortly by F-15s , F-16s , and other B-1 bombers from bases across the country , Air Force spokeswoman Wendy Frable said .
