Brent Crude Closes off Session Low
LONDON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Benchmark Brent crude futures closed at 11.50 U.S. dollars a barrel Wednesday , up 12 cents on the day having earlier established a new 12-year low of 11.15 dollars a barrel .
The Brent crude has not been as low since 1986 , when it slipped below 9 dollars a barrel .
However , Wednesday 's closing price is 7 cents higher than the previous close .
The deepening oil market crisis is expected to weigh heavily on the ministerial meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) scheduled for next week in Vienna .
" If the expectation is to cut more , maybe it is too much for OPEC to handle that , " Sayed Mehdi Hosseini , Iran 's deputy oil minister for international affairs , told the annual oil and money conference in London Wednesday .
" At present additional output curtailment by producers does not appear feasible , " Reuters quoted Adrian Lajous , head of Mexico 's state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos , as saying Wednesday .
" Facing a massive stock overhang and weak demand there is not much more OPEC can do these days , " said London 's Center for Global Energy Studies .
OPEC 's efforts this year to rescue the market have been largely ruined by a record stockpile of crude and refined petroleum products and shrinking demand , in particular from Asian consumers .
As supplies have already been cut by 10 percent and that made no impact on prices , oil producers are considered in poor shape to take further action .
