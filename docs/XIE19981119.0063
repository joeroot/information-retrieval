Zambian MPs Condemn Idea of Barotseland 's
LUSAKA , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Ten parliamentary members ( MPs ) from Barotseland or Western Province of Zambia Wednesday condemned the idea of their region 's break-away from Zambia and form one country with the Caprivi Strip of the northeastern Namibia .
The MPs from the ruling Movement for Muti-party Democracy ( MMD ) disassociated themselves from earlier remarks made by Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika , president of opposition Agenda for Zambia ( AZ ) which has been advocating for a free and independent Barotseland , according to Zambia News Agency ZANA .
Lewanika , a royal member of Barotseland , said last Monday the Caprivian Lozis from Namibia and those from the Barotseland were of " one people " and they had the right to decide either to " rejoin " a free Barotseland , establish their self-rule or remain part of Namibia .
He also admitted meeting in recent months with top figures of the Namibia 's Caprivian secessionist movement led by Mishake Muyongo , president of the country 's largest opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance .
Mwitila Shumina , spokesman of the ten MPs including Foreign Minister Keli Walubita , said the AZ leader was not a spokesman of Western Province and his remarks had threatened the peace there .
The utterances of Lewanika would scare away potential investors in the province and it was therefore important for the Zambian government to study his statements for the truth and build investor confidence , said Shumina , who added that they were not only politically damaging but economically disastrous .
On the alliance of Caprivi-Western Province , Shumina said the natural relationship of inter-border area did not correspond with international law on boundaries .
" People of Western Province are aware that ethnic relationships are common factors in most border areas hence the Caprivi issue is not unique and it should not be used as a barometer of problems in Zambia and Namibia , " he said .
Chief government spokesman Newstead Zimba disclosed last Monday the Zambian government was studying the remarks made by the AZ leader and said the utterances concerning the links between the Lozis of the Barotseland and those of the Caprivi who were considered rebels in their own country were " serious " and needed careful scrutiny .
The remarks also drew the attention of Namibian High Commission based in Lusaka .
Acting High Commissioner Albert Lushetile said last Tuesday that Lewanika 's recent remarks were a matter of concern to his government .
He noted that just like Zambia , Namibia was a sovereign state and there was no way that such activities of secession could be condoned and supported by both countries .
A Namibian newspaper , The Namibian , reported last Friday the leaders of the Caprivi movement were now forging an alliance with Lozi separatists in the Barotseland .
In the last two weeks , according to the United Nations Humanitarian Information Unit , over 400 Caprivian separatists had fled Namibia to neighboring Botswana to seek refuge , claiming persecution at home .
It said Namibian President Sam Nujoma had asked Botswana to repatriate them to face charges of treason and murder .
