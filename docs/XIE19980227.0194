Ban on Demonstrations Possible in Zimbabwe :
HARARE , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Demonstrations which are likely to result in breakdown of law and order or infringe on the rights of the majority risk being banned , Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said here on Thursday .
Addressing 151 graduating recruit constables , including 24 graduates from University of Zimbabwe , the minister said the core duty of the police is to maintain law and order .
" Those engaged in a demonstration expect their right to demonstrate and express their views while on the other hand , those not participating expect the same officer to ensure that their rights of free movement and security of person and property are not interfered with by those demonstrating , " he said .
Therefore , he asked the public to understand that " when we ban demonstrations , we do so in the interests of the majority , whose rights are likely to be impeded in the process . "
The minister said that the Public Order and Security Bill is seeking to clarify ambiguities in police powers and will express when and how police should resort to use of force including the use of firearms .
" On use of force , and in particular firearms , the police currently operate on the basis of their own administrative guidelines which besides having no force of law are fraught with problems of their own , " he said .
He appealed for public support and cooperation in this regard .
