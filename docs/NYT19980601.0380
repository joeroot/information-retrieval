LOS ANGELES _ Q. In a recent staff meeting , the director of purchasing reminded all of us that if our work hours are 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. , we are to keep those hours .
We are salaried employees but were told that regardless of whether we come in an hour earlier to catch up on work , we can not leave any time before 4 p.m. However , there are some employees who are `` exceptions '' to this rule , but the director will not let me move my hours .
What do you suggest I do ?
S.M .
A. The director is using a managerial philosophy from George Orwell 's `` Animal Farm '' in which all employees are equal , but some are more equal than others .
Unfortunately , when management demands adherence to company rules and then allows certain `` exceptions , '' it is a sign of other managerial problems , including a lack of trust , respect and credibility .
It is ironic that management would be rigid about work hours in an era that is typified by increased flexibility .
More and more companies are implementing flex-time programs and relying on a philosophy that builds jobs around people rather than vice versa .
One step is for you and several of your associates to meet with the director and your supervisor regarding the work hours .
This is not a complaint session , but rather a constructive discussion in which you suggest an experiment with a flex-time program .
Be prepared to discuss the program 's benefits , the specifics of how it will work and how you will measure its success .
Flex-time can truly help a company 's effectiveness , and so can flexible management .
& QL ; Q. One of my co-workers can get real obnoxious and make comments to me that he thinks are cute , but they 're not .
I read that in this type of situation , a person should act the same way right back at the person and that will get the offensive comments to stop .
Do you agree ?
L.A .
& QL ; A. Comments that are obnoxious and supposedly cute actually sound like harassment , and the last thing that is going to stop a harasser is more harassment .
If you want him to stop , you need to be clear , firm and direct .
By making some equally obnoxious comments in return , all you will be doing is placing yourself in an escalating verbal joust .
Rather than stopping him , your volley will just encourage him to try even harder to top you .
In essence , you will be increasing the unpleasant behavior , rather than decreasing it .
And if you decide at some point to report the matter to your manager , how will you feel when this person relates some of the obnoxious comments that you made to him ?
He could even play victim .
If someone is making these kinds of comments to you , the best approach is to let the individual know your feelings about the comments , be specific about the behavior that must be stopped , and then add that you hope you will not have to take any further action on this matter .
The idea of using the same behavior as an obnoxious co-worker has a catchy visual appeal , but it does not work .
And , if you do so , you might not work either .
Q. I have been the marketing director for the past 10 years in a family owned business that is still run by the 85-year-old founder .
I find that he is threatened by me and tries to sabotage my success by withholding information , telling other people not to involve me , and manipulating things that I bring in so that he does not have to pay me .
I am considering several actions , but I am not sure what to do .
G.H .
A. Threats , sabotage and manipulation are hardly the hallmarks of a successful working relationship .
However , while the founder 's behavior may be exactly as you describe , you also need to consider his perceptions .
Like many entrepreneurs , he may be having difficulty letting go of the marketing reins , as he was most likely the original marketing department .
In addition , do you think he may have some arguably solid reasons for the way he has been dealing with you ?
The best initial action is to meet with him to discuss the problem .
Importantly , be sure to use your sales and marketing skills during this meeting .
For example , let him see the costs associated with excluding you from any key processes , along with the direct benefits that accrue to him and the company when you are appropriately involved , informed and rewarded .
Try to pace your presentation to match his style , and be sure to use words that have a strong emotional charge for entrepreneurs , such as profit , achievement , growth , challenge and success .
His reaction will help you determine your next action .
