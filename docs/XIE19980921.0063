Jiangsu Expects Double-Digit Growth
NANJING , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Residents in east China 's Jiangsu Province have conquered rampant summer flooding and are working diligently to achieve this year 's annual growth target of 11 percent .
Chen Huanyou , secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People 's Congress , made the comments on Monday .
Chen said Jiangsu 's years of efforts to build water conservancy facilities enabled the province to escape casualties and maintain the integrity of levees during heavy summer flooding .
The province maintained economic development efforts throughout the taxing flood season , said Chen , adding that Jiangsu has adopted substantive measures for investment , consumption and exports .
Jiangsu 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) for the first six months grew by eight percent on the previous year 's period , with accelerated growth recorded for both July and August .
Chen said that extensive efforts will be made to ensure agricultural and industrial growth .
The province has invested heavily in infrastructure construction , including roads and bridges , power generation projects , and telecommunications and environmental protection facilities , said Chen .
For example , Jiangsu has spent over 40 billion yuan to construct expressways stretching over 1,000 kilometers .
He said Jiangsu has successfully dealt with the negative impacts of the ongoing financial turmoil in Asia .
