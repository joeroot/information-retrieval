New Technique May End Painful Vaccinations
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- American scientists said Thursday that they have developed a technique that could lead to needle-free vaccinations .
They have discovered that the toxin produced by the cholera bacterium stimulates an immune response even when it is put on the skin , and that it speeds up immune responses to any other foreign protein added to it .
Tests on mice showed that when the diphtheria and tetanus toxins , which were mixed with cholera toxin , were applied to the surface of skin , the body can generate antibodies to diphtheria and tetanus .
" The implications are that one could eliminate needles . "
said researchers of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research , in Washington DC .
Their work was published in the science journal Nature .
Trials on humans are due to start at the end of next month .
If all goes well the system could be available commercially within the next five to ten years .
This technique could revolutionize vaccination programs in developing countries , where disease can be spread because of the lack of sterile needles .
