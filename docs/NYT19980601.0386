NEW YORK _ `` P.O.V . , '' the public television showcase for independent documentaries , begins its summer season Tuesday night with an offering from the true-confessions department .
Having discovered the magic of the camera , producers commonly turn the lens on themselves and their families and friends on the principle that they must be as fascinating to others as they are to themselves .
`` Baby , It 's You '' is Anne Makepeace 's earnest report of a year of trying , with her husband , Peter Behrens , to have a baby in the new-fashioned way , with the help of fertility drugs and techniques that pluck unfertilized eggs from a woman 's ovaries , combine them with sperm and insert them in her fallopian tubes .
Variations on artificial insemination have become a staple of television news magazines , with the camera bringing viewers such intimate sights as the ovary .
For all the biological differences , to my unexpert eye , those pictures look a lot like the fuzzy show my urologist puts on during our periodic visits ; it never occurred to me that anybody else might find them of interest .
The hour 's angst is filled out by encounters with family members .
The most compelling and emotionally charged connection is between the couple 's efforts to have a child and the more successful yet tragic efforts of Behrens ' older sister and her lesbian lover to do likewise .
His younger sister 's recent abortion stirs painful memories of Ms. Makepeace 's own abortion 30 years ago .
As for Ms. Makepeace 's two brothers , who take up a fair amount of time _ a reclusive goat herd and an aspiring polygamist ( he plans on having 20 children ) _ they demonstrate that people can be unconventional yet remain uninteresting .
There is no doubting Ms. Makepeace 's honesty , but watching her watch her ovaries is not exhilarating .
The documentary is infected with the self-absorption that is evidently encouraged at film festivals .
( `` Baby , It 's You '' was a Sundance Film Festival selection . )
The writing sometimes seems borrowed from the travelogue repertory _ `` This year has been a journey to our past and our families '' _ and the program might have benefited from sterner editing of the desultory interviews .
The exchanges between Ms. Makepeace and Behrens as they endure their emotional ups and downs become particularly wearing .
I was happy to see the couple go off into the sunset , even if it looked stagy .
Ms. Makepeace has nothing good to say about the long-abandoned rules of privacy that her older relatives tell of observing before the video revolution , but inhibitions about baring in public what used to be considered private matters did , at least , spare audiences some tedium .
