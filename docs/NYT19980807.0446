PARCELLS PRAISES THE JETS , SORT OF

The New York Jets crushed the Philadelphia Eagles on the ground , and Curtis Martin , the 1,000-yard man , was not even playing .
So while Thursday night 's 29 - 15 victory was the preseason opener in Philadelphia against a team whose run defense was ranked 25th last season , Coach Bill Parcells had some kind words for the offensive line Friday .
Sort of .
`` Offensively , we accomplished some things fairly well ; over all I was pleased with the running and the line , a little bit , '' he said .
`` We had a few little protection problems with the second group , particularly with guard positions .
But overall , I 'd have to say , there I felt OK ''
That is a huge admission from the coach , whose demeanor after early preseason games ranges from disgust to distress .
Yet , his revamped offensive line generated a surge , especially up the middle , that was particularly strong in the first half when Richie Anderson pounded out 66 yards on 14 attempts .
He is not even the No. 2 tailback .
After Martin , there is Leon Johnson .
Anderson is trying to make the team .
Overall , the Jets ran 44 times for 162 yards .
Johnson picked up 40 on 10 carries , and fullback Jerald Sowell added 17 on only four attempts .
Martin , nursing a hamstring injury , will be back next Saturday against the Baltimore Ravens at Giants Stadium .
He said he can n't wait .
It will also be a benchmark game to see whether the offensive line can establish itself as a consistent unit .
`` The line was very encouraging watching the blocking for the running , '' Martin said .
`` It looks like a lot of things were open .
The holes were open , and receivers were open and they were blocking , too .
It definitely inspired me . ''
And why not ?
Left tackle Jumbo Elliott said of the effort : `` We 're going to get way better .
It takes four or five games before you 're playing your best as a line . ''
Considering that Parcells plans to have the ball handed to Martin 300 times , and hopes to run 500 times over all , that is an encouraging assessment for Jets fans .
They will see a line that could be 60 percent overhauled _ from Kevin Mawae , the highly regarded center from Seattle , to Todd Burger at left guard , to the likely emergence of the rookie Jason Fabini of Cincinnati at right tackle .
Elliot was at his usual left tackle spot , while Matt O ' Dwyer anchored right guard .
Fabini alternated with Siupeli Malamala .
It was at center and left guard last year that the Jets proved vulnerable too often .
But Glenn Foley and Vinny Testaverde , who played with the regulars , had good protection , with only Foley suffering one sack .
`` I thought we did a better job inside , '' Parcells said Frirday .
`` We looked at Fabini a lot .
I thought Burger gave up one sack , but other than that had good run-blocking .
I 'd like to see Jumbo a little bit more aggressive .
He 's kind of hopping on his block , but he 'll be OK .
Mawae is a solid player . ''
It is a measure of how far the Jets ' running game has come that not too long ago Anderson was considered a possible No. 1 running back .
But now , despite heroics that included a touchdown , Parcells said that the runner is going to have to make it on special teams as well .
`` Curtis could have played in the game , '' Parcells said .
`` I want to see him , and I think everyone wants to see him .
He hasn n't played football in a while now .
He missed a few games the end of last year ; we need to get him game-ready right now . ''
Even though he didn n't figure on playing last Thursday , Martin still suited up .
Why ?
`` I just wanted to be dressed , '' Martin said , `` just in case he said , ` Get in there . '' '
