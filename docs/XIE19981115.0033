Russia Welcomes Iraqi Cooperation with U.N.
MOSCOW , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Russia on Saturday welcomed Iraq 's decision to allow the unconditional return of U.N. weapons inspectors , saying that the tension around Iraq has eased .
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Baghdad will allow the inspectors of both the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to return and resume their normal missions .
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk said Iraq " has taken an extremely important step which has provided an opportunity for a speedy settlement of the crisis by political methods , excluding the use of force . "
He told the local Ekho Moskvy radio program Aziz 's message was made in response to appeals from Annan , Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and in order to give an additional chance for administering justice in lifting the blockade .
Posuvalyuk said Russia hopes that the U.N. Security Council will " respond adequately to this message , to this big shift in Baghdad 's position , " Itar-Tass reported .
Aziz , in the letter read on Iraqi television , expressed the hope that the resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors will be " a step towards " lifting sanctions against Iraq .
He said the previous Iraqi decisions to stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors were only aimed at seeking an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.N. sanctions .
Iraq announced two decisions in August and October to partially and totally stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors .
It demands the U.N. consider the lifting of the eight-year-old comprehensive sanctions on it .
Under U.N. resolutions , the sanctions can only be lifted after the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction .
Aziz said the decision to resume cooperation with the U.N. came when many security council members oppose a military solution to the current crisis and support Iraq 's view over the lifting of the sanctions .
Aziz gave special credit to Russian , Chinese and French diplomacy for the resumption of the cooperation .
