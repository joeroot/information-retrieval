NATO Readies Extraction Forces for OSCE Verifiers
MONS , Belgium , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- NATO 's extraction forces , with a task to extract international verifiers from Kosovo in extreme circumstances , are expected to be operational in the first week of December , a NATO official said on Wednesday .
The official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told a media briefing that the extraction forces can , within 30 to 60 minutes weather permits , react to pull out Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) verifiers or to rescue the verifiers taken hostage in Kosovo .
The western military alliance is preparing the multinational extraction forces at the request of OSCE and the special forces , to be based in nearby Macedonia , will have 1,500 to 2,000 troops .
The mission of the extraction forces will be 12 months to coincide with the mission of the OSCE verification .
France will lead the extraction forces with the participation of Britain , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands and Greece .
The core of the extraction forces will be French paratroopers , according to NATO sources .
The extraction forces will be armed with armored vehicles and armored attack helicopters for mobility and safety , the official said .
Though the official said that the extraction forces will be deployed only under extreme circumstances , NATO decision makers are still studying the legal basis for foreign troops entering the sovereign territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the rules of engagement in Kosovo .
He added that the core element of the extraction forces will be in place within 36 to 72 hours after receiving the activation orders from the North Atlantic Council , the decision-making body of the 16-nation alliance .
The council approved the concept of extraction forces last Friday but the activation orders are yet to reach the joint operation center based outside the Belgian town of Mons later this week .
In the deals reached between NATO and Yugoslavia and between OSCE and Yugoslavia , the Yugoslav forces are to ensure the safety of the 2,000-member OSCE verification team .
The verifiers will first resort to the Yugoslav authorities if there should arise uncertain or hostile circumstances .
When the Yugoslav forces fail to react , the extraction forces will be called in to react , said the official .
