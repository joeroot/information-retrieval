BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese Postmaster General Liu Liqing said that China will further regulate the stamp collection market in order to create a sound environment for the 22nd Conference of the Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) and the ' 99 World Stamp Collection Exhibition to be held in Beijing next August .
The State Postal Bureau has disciplined a number of subordinate enterprises in Guizhou , Sichuan , Inner Mongolia , Anhui and Beijing for violating regulations relating to the issuance and distribution of stamps and post cards .
Five employees responsible for the violations were dismissed from the enterprises .
This decision was announced at a national television conference of postal bureaus in Beijing earlier this week .
Liu said that in a bid to strengthen the regulation of this market , the State Postal Bureau will severely punish enterprises and individuals who violate the rules , and encourage those who obey the rules and report the illicit activities of others .
He said that the Chinese government attaches great importance to the UPU conference and the World Stamp Collection Exhibition , and state leaders have repeatedly expressed their determination to guarantee the success of the conference .
Preparations for the conference and exhibition are now proceeding smoothly .
Liu said that the State Postal Bureau 's move is a major step taken to create favorable conditions for the conference .
According to Liu , China 's stamp collection market has been growing steadily since the beginning of this year .
Operation revenue of the stamp collection arm of the State Postal Bureau was 6.58 billion yuan between January and October , accounting for 27 percent of the bureau 's total revenue in that period .
At present , the number of people collecting stamps in China exceeds ten million .
