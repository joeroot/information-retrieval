Johansson Beats Rusedski in Stockholm Open
STOCKHOLM , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Unseeded Todd Martin and Thomas Johansson eliminated Britain 's best to reach the singles final of the Stockholm Open on Saturday .
Martin rallied from a set down to beat third-seeded Tim Henman 4 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 in the first semifinal , while Johansson , the highest 18th - ranked Swede , edged fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski 7 - 5 , 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) before a sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall .
Henman had clinched the seventh berth to the ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover , Germany , later this month by winning Friday 's quarterfinals .
Rusedski needed a victory to clinch the eighth and last spot .
" It 's disappointing , but at least I gave it a shot , " Rusedski said .
" It will not be fun sitting as an alternate in Hanover .
I don n't see ( Yevgeny ) Kafelnikov losing in Moscow . "
Kafelnikov needs to beat Goran Ivanisevic in front of his Russian fans in Moscow 's ATP Tour event Sunday to secure the eight h berth in Hanover .
Rusedski is the world 's leading indoor player this year with 32 victories and he beat top-ranked Pete Sampras to win the Paris Open last week .
But Rusedski , one of the biggest servers in the game , faced a Swede playing perhaps the best tennis of his life in his favorite indoor tournament .
The Swede , also a big server , broke Rusedski twice in the first set , the last time for 6 - 5 , and then held to love to close out the set .
In the tiebreak , Johansson committed a rare double-fault to give Rusedski a set point at 6 - 5.
The Swede saved it with a forehand passing shot into the corner .
Another forehand winner gave him the tiebreak 9 - 7 and the match .
Martin , ranked 21st on the ATP Tour , played near flawless tennis after losing the first set to Henman .
Martin won one ATP Tour event this year in Barcelona on clay .
He also reached the semis in Indianapolis , Vienna and the Paris Open .
After dropping the opening set , Martin broke Henman twice to level the match at one set apiece .
Martin got off to a perfect start in the decider , breaking Henman 's serve after two straight unforced errors by the Briton , and broke Henman again to lead 4 - 1 , the fourth time the Briton dropped his serve in his last five service games .
It was Martin 's third victory in four matches against Henman .
