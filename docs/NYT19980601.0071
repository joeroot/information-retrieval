& HT ; Commentary : Enough memories to fill a book & HT ; & HT ; By VICKI MARSH KABAT & HT ; c.
1998 Cox News Service
In my day , they were called scrapbooks .
They were bound with twine and had big , black pages .
You used Elmer 's Glue , those little triangular picture tabs and a white pencil to write your captions .
Now , they 're called Memory Books .
Having just compiled one for our newly graduated high schooler , let me assure you , I made some memories .
Here 's my first tip for would-be Memory Book makers : Don n't wait until three days before presenting it to start the project .
Bad idea .
You need at least three months .
If you want it to be a surprise , you also need a separate , locked room in your house in which to assemble it .
At first , the Memory Book seemed like a good idea .
Blithely , I went off to the craft store , selected a big , red book , an array of colorful acid-free papers , stickers and glue sticks .
The acid-free designation is critically important .
Don n't ask me why , it just is .
Come to think of it , it was an important designation back in the '60s , too .
Fifty dollars later I had a huge sack of ...
stuff , all of which was unorganized , unassembled and unlikely to get any other way .
What in the world had I gotten myself into ?
Nevertheless , I dug in .
I went through box after box of photos recounting the first 18 years of our son 's life .
While I was sitting in the middle of the floor , surrounded by pictures , kindergarten papers , blue ribbons , piano recital programs and grade cards , he suddenly pounded on the front door , which I had dead-bolted so he couldn n't unlock it .
Throwing myself against the little window in the door so he couldn n't look in , I yelled , `` What do you want ? ''
`` I want in , '' he hollered back .
`` You can n't come in .
Sit on the front porch . ''
Befuddled , he sat while I hurriedly threw everything into a sack and hid it under our bed .
`` OK , '' I said , unlocking the door .
`` You can come in now . ''
He looked at me askance and then said , `` I don n't even want to know . ''
`` Good .
You don n't need to know . ''
Deep into the second night of the project , I was only up to his elementary school years .
Peeling the acid-free glue from my fingers , I hollered for my husband , who so far had studiously avoided me .
`` Quick , run to the craft store and get three more sheets of the blue cloud paper , two with a sports theme , one more of the music and the super-size glue stick .
All acid-free ! ''
I shouted as he bolted out the door .
Our two younger sons developed a secret knock for our bedroom door , behind which I was sequestered .
Tap , taptaptap .
`` Mom , '' came the furtive whisper .
`` It 's me .
Let me in . ''
Gathered around me as I glued and snipped , captioned and stickered , the boys were duly impressed .
`` Geez , are you going to do this for us , too ? ''
they asked .
My eyes widened in horror .
Of course I would have to , wouldn n't I?
When you have three kids , once is never enough .
Remember that when you get these harebrained , spur-of-the-moment ideas .
My husband returned from the craft store , a harried look in his eyes .
Handing me the sack , he said , `` I got lost in the potpourri department and couldn n't get out .
Don n't make me go back . ''
Twenty-four hours later , I slapped down the last decorative frame and slipped the last plastic protective sheet in place .
Paper scraps were piled ankle-high around me .
But in my hands was a masterpiece that contains the milestones of our son 's life .
In my heart , however , there was much , much more .
The memory of first discovering we were pregnant , the thrill of the doctor saying `` It 's a boy ! '' , the exultation of the grandparents and family , our son 's first words and first shaky steps , the first day of school , a medical crisis and the harrowing days that followed , his first piano recital .
Yes , the book holds a lot of memories , but not all of them .
And those I hold in my heart don n't need any acid-free guarantee to preserve them .
