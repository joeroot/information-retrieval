Tanzanian PM Declares Personal Assets
DAR ES SALAAM , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye declared personal assets to the public Thursday in a bold gesture to involve himself in the national anti-corruption campaign .
Convening a press conference at the Prime Minister 's residence in Dar es Salaam , Sumaye said he has two simple houses , three cars , two tractors , farms and other properties .
" The assets belong to me and my wife , " Sumaye said .
Sumaye is also a National Executive Committee member and a Central Commission member of the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi ( CCM ) .
One of his houses is located in his home village Endasak , in Hanang District in the northern region of Arusha , and the other lies in Mbagala in the suburbs of Dar es Salaam which is rented to clients at 360,000 Shillings ( about 537 U.S. Dollars ) annually , he said .
The Prime Minister said he has three cars , an old Toyota Corolla saloon , and two other vehicles purchased with car loans offered to him because he is a member of parliament .
He uses his monthly salaries to repay the loans .
Sumaye said he also has two second-handed tractors , and a grinding machine which is out of use .
Other assets , he said , include 50 heads of dairy cattle , 50 heads of indigenous cattle and 50 heads of goat in unsurveyed farms in Kibaha , some 40 kilometers northwest of Dar es Salaam .
Currently , Sumaye said , he is building a house in the Jangwani beach in the capital city with a 50-million-Shilling ( about 80,000 U.S. Dollars ) loan from the Parastatal Pension Funds ( PPF ) , adding that he may be able to repay it in ten years .
The premier said he has few bank savings .
Sumaye said his wife owns a secretarial bureau in the Mavuno Building in Dar es Salaam .
Apart from the properties , Sumaye said he has 1,000 Tanzania Breweries Limited ( TBL ) shares and 1,000 Tanzania Oxygen Limited ( TOL ) shares , each priced at 500 Shillings when launched earlier this year .
Earlier this week , the Arusha and Dodoma regional commissioners declared their personal assets .
Tanzanian government and party leaders have been urged by President Benjamin Mkapa , who is also the CCM National Chairman , to declare their personal assets every year so that they can not abuse power to amass wealth .
Mkapa himself has declared his personal assets to the public .
The leaders are expected to fill in forms of personal assets at the office of the Ethics Commissioner Judge William J. Manina , and those who make false reports may face legal punishment .
