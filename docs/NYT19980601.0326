An estimated 65 million Americans are on diets right now , many of them on one of those trendy high-protein , low-carbohydrate diets .
The Sugar Busters diet is the newest , but these diets can all trace their roots to the Atkins diet of the 1970s .
We know you 're probably not listening , but we have to say this anyway : The American Dietetic Association would remind you of the bottom line : In order to lose weight on a regular basis , you must use more calories than you consume .
In other words : Eat less .
Exercise more .
