( For use by clients of the New York Times News Service ) Locating Loans to Grow a Company By Laura Castaneda c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle Small businesses , especially women - and minority-owned firms , are booming .
But finding the money to start and grow a new company , however , can be a struggle for any entrepreneur .
Most people typically start their own businesses by borrowing from family and friends , using their savings and credit cards , or by taking a home equity or 401 ( k ) loan .
But other financing options are available , including loan guarantees , traditional bank loans , micro-enterprise loans , business incubators , angel investors and venture capital .
Many of these programs target specific groups of entrepreneurs , such as women , gays , African Americans , Asians or Latinos .
No matter who you are , preparation is the key .
You need to know how to find these programs .
And you must have a clean credit record and a solid business plan .
Take Johnicon George .
The 29-year-old opened African Heritage Books & AMP ; Gifts in San Francisco 's Bayview Hunter 's Point neighborhood almost a year ago .
He was already selling books from home via mail and the Internet when he sought help from a couple neighborhood nonprofit groups that assist small businesses .
These groups helped George put together a business plan , which helped him qualify for two loans totaling $ 20,000 from Fairfield-based Westamerica Bank .
`` It would have taken me a lot longer to open a store without the loans , '' he said .
& UR ; & LR ; You can start getting help by checking with the Small Business Administration , a chamber of commerce , or other small business groups .
These organizations can tell you how and where to get training .
They can also point you to local nonprofits or banks that earmark funds for small businesses .
Here 's a review of your main financing options :
_ SBA Loan Guarantees
The SBA is the best place to start for any would-be entrepreneur .
The SBA 's Service Corp of Retired Business Executives ( SCORE ) , with 65 locations in the Bay Area , offer one-day workshops on how to start and manage a business .
The SBA 's Small Business Development Centers ( SBDC ) are usually located in community colleges and provide free consulting and training to existing small businesses .
The SBA 's prequalification program helps entrepreneurs prequalify for loans by linking them with local nonprofits that help them develop business plans .
& UR ; & LR ; Most importantly , the SBA is a guarantor of small business loans , which means the agency will guarantee up to 80 percent of small business loans of up to $ 750,000 by banks .
& UR ; & LR ; The SBA also has special angel investor and venture capital programs , some of which target women and minorities .
( For more information , see below . )
_ Bank Loans , Credit Lines
Many banks offer small business loans , some of which specifically target women and minorities .
You need a good credit record and a solid business plan to qualify for a traditional loan .
Trouble is , bank loans are difficult to get .
To qualify for a loan at Wells Fargo , your business needs to be at least three years old and profitable , among other things .
Most banks also use credit scoring , a computer model that relies heavily on a credit history analysis .
Critics believe banks should give more weight to outside community support that small businesses , especially minorities , get from nonprofits .
But one bank , Westamerica , does not use credit scoring in its California Business Loan Program .
Its average loan is about $ 6,000 per person .
To qualify for a Westamerica loan , the business must be in a low - to moderate-income neighborhood .
You need to have a low - to moderate-income , or the business must serve a community need , such as providing child care .
More banks and credit card companies are also offering credit lines to small businesses .
Unlike loans , which give you money up front , a credit line lets you draw money as you need it .
But there 's one caveat : Credit lines should never be used to pay for long-term business needs , such as equipment .
Instead , they should be used to solve short-term cash flow shortages , such as payroll .
_ Micro-enterprise Loans
Micro-enterprise loans are available for businesses with five employees or less , many of which are created by entrepreneurs as a way to provide jobs for themselves and their families .
There are more than 100 micro-enterprise loan programs in California .
Loans range from $ 500 to $ 25 , 000 , with the average about $ 5 , 000 .
Many programs target women and minorities .
To find a local micro-enterprise program near you , contact your city offices , a chamber of commerce , the SBA or a local SBDC .
You can also contact the Association for Enterprise Opportunity in Chicago .
_ Business Incubators
Business incubators sometimes have loan programs .
But more often than not , they provide start-up businesses with low-cost office space , support services and business training .
To get accepted into a business incubator , you generally need some experience , a bookkeeping / accounting system , a reasonable credit history and a willingness to take advantage of the incubator 's assistance .
There are about 50 business incubators in California , many of which target women and minorities .
To locate one near you , contact the Pacific Business Incubation Network .
_ Angel Investors
The SBA 's ACE-Net , or Angel Capital Electronic Network , helps high net worth individuals find small businesses to invest in .
The upper limit is $ 5 million , but most small businesses that get funding through ACE-Net receive about $ 1 million .
Both start-up and growing businesses are eligible to apply .
It 's also possible to find angel investors on your own , but you may want to start by contacting the Bay Area Regional Technology Alliance to join ACE-Net .
_ Venture Capital
Traditional venture capital is difficult to get because VC firms are looking for companies that can grow really big , really fast .
Unless you own a high-tech company , this usually excludes small businesses .
But if you want to research venture capital firms , look for two books in the library : `` Pratt 's Guide to Venture Capital Sources '' and `` Galante 's Complete Venture Capital and Private Equity Directory . ''
The SBA also runs the Small Business Investment Companies ( SBIC ) program , where small venture capital firms provide a combination of their own money and SBA-guaranteed funds to small businesses .
The average amount of money awarded through the SBIC is $ 600 , 000 .
The SBIC program also has a special program , Small Specialized Business Investment Companies , or SSBIC , that targets women and minorities .
