Tung Calls for Unity in Overcoming Economic Difficulties
HONG KONG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) said Monday that the government , employers and employees must work hand-in-hand to overcome the difficulties during this period of economic adjustment .
Tung said this during meetings with labor representatives to exchange views with them on the preparation for the Policy Address , which he will deliver early next month .
In analyzing the present economic situation , Tung said : " All of us know that the period of economic adjustment we are going through is painful but necessary . "
" The market adjustments will help enhance our competitiveness .
This is conducive to our economic recovery , " he said
Tung emphasized that he hoped that in adjusting staff wages , companies in the private sector would fully take into account the difficulties their staff might be facing .
" The employers and employees are in the same boat and must help each other to tide over this difficult period , " he stressed .
Tung expected that the economic downturn would not reverse in the short term .
He called on the community to face the reality , take the situation as a whole into consideration and rationally resolve labor problems .
All parties must consider first the interest of the community as a whole before taking any action .
They must make sure that their action will not affect the daily living of the general public and business operation in the SAR , he said .
" The government will continue its efforts to improve the investment environment .
We will encourage investments , which will in turn create job opportunities , " he said .
Tung said that the Labor Department stood ready to provide conciliation service to help settle labor disputes .
" We hoped both employers and employees would seek a solution peacefully and would not resort to drastic measures , " he said .
" The government is very concerned about the labor dispute involving Hongkong Telecom , " Tung said .
The dispute was caused by the announcement last week by the management of the Hongkong Telecom , the biggest telecommunications company in Hong Kong , to cut the staff wages by 10 percent .
" On this , the Labor Department has expressed deep concern to the company 's management and urged them to continue the dialogue with staff to see whether there are other alternatives , " Tung said .
" We appeal to employees to remain calm and continue to discuss with management on ways of resolving their differences , " he said .
On civil service pay adjustments , Tung said : " As a responsible employer , the government will not abruptly change the established pay adjustment mechanism .
We will also make sure that pay adjustments for the civil service are justified and reasonable . "
