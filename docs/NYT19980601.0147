LES BUBBAS KNOW ABOUT GOOD CAJUN TASTE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By HARRY SHATTUCK c.1998 Houston Chronicle
Dining parlors beckon by the dozens along Interstate 10 .
Beside other roadways , too , in southwest Louisiana .
Cajun Kitchen .
Cajun Haven .
Cajun Grill .
Cajun Tales .
Cajun Connection .
Cajun Way .
Cajun King .
Some satisfy the taste buds ; others are merely passable .
A few don n't even bother to pretend authenticity .
Certainly , none prepares fall-apart-tender beef in a `` Cajun microwave . ''
And none smokes succulent pork in a `` Cajun spaceship . ''
Only Les Bubbas claim those distinctions , as I gleefully discovered at a `` duck camp feast '' in Lafayette , La.
Les Bubbas , an ever-expanding assemblage of Acadian-heritage part-time chefs , are self-appointed informal ambassadors of a proud culture .
Especially its hospitality .
And its food .
Their appearances are seldom scheduled .
But throw a party , and they are quick to volunteer .
In Lafayette .
Or Quebec .
`` All we ever ask in return is all the beer we can drink , or maybe a little red wine _ you know , to get the imagination flowing , '' says Ray Guidry , described by his associates as `` the head bubba . ''
`` We started about 20 years ago with one pot and a lot of different ideas about ingredients , '' Guidry says .
`` We cooked around the campfire . ''
The fun intensified during hunting trips _ thus the `` duck camp '' label _ with each man trying to outdo the others by implementing new techniques and seasonings .
`` We only had a few of us at the start ; now there must be 100 or more , '' Guidry says .
`` There are so many that we can n't remember names .
That 's why we just call each other Bubba . ''
All have full-time jobs .
But , says Guidry , `` We love people ; the closer we are to people and the more enjoyment we can bring them , the happier we are . ''
Les Bubbas decry the misinterpretation they see applied to authentic Cajun cuisine .
`` We go into some of these restaurants that call themselves Cajun , and the first thing we see is a big bottle of Tabasco on the table , '' Guidry says .
`` Nothing against Tabasco _ it 's a fine product _ but that 's not what real Cajun food is all about .
It 's not about cayenne pepper , either . ''
Bobby Castille , a Lafayette city councilman who joined Les Bubbas several years back , elaborates : `` If the first thing you taste is pepper , it 's not Cajun .
If you 're eating potatoes , you should taste potatoes .
Same with pork or duck .
We use seasoning to enhance the flavoring , not to spoil it . ''
Les Bubbas discover fascinating ways to maximize those flavors , too .
Guidry helped pioneer the `` Cajun microwave , '' so named because it 's a not-so-instant and not-so-new outdoor cooking mechanism that at first impression could be mistaken for an enormous steel box .
The meat goes on a rack near the bottom ; charcoal is placed on another rack toward the top .
`` Or we use wood if we don n't have any charcoal , '' says Robert Domingue , Guidry 's colleague .
`` We build the heat from the top .
The walls ( side and bottom ) have up to 3 inches of insulation .
It has a cover .
We can smoke a 25-pound roast in our ` microwave . '
`` Everyone has his special technique , too .
You might take a knife and put a slit in the roast , then stuff it with a little onion or garlic or salt and pepper .
Or you might prefer a little sage .
Anything you like . ''
The `` spaceship '' is an L-shaped smoker that all but defies description .
`` I can guarantee that there 's nothing else in the world quite like it , because I spent a lot of years experimenting to get it right , '' says Paul Benton , the inventor .
The heat source is in the lower ( horizontal ) part of the L , and the meat is hung in the vertical part so that smoke circulates and surrounds it .
Benton hangs up to three kinds of meat at one time , with the fattiest at the top so the flavoring drips onto the others .
His secret ingredient ?
`` I brush the meat over and over with 7-Up and honey , '' Benton confides .
Les Bubbas have traveled all over the South preparing delectable meats , smothered potatoes , crawfish touffe , maque choux and whatever else the imagination dictates .
Last year , they were invited to a Duck Festival near Montreal .
`` We cooked duck gumbo and duck jambalaya _ hundreds and hundreds of pounds of duck , '' says Carrol Credeur .
Always at their side are Les Bubbettes , otherwise known as the wives .
`` The Bubbettes have an important role , '' Guidry insists .
`` Yeah , we get to cut the onions , '' says Peggy Benoit .
She jests .
These volunteer men and women work closely together , both in food preparation and in spreading fun .
`` My first question , when I became part of the group , was , ` Who gives the orders ? '' ' Castille says .
`` And they said , ` No one does .
If you see something that needs doing , do it . ' Everybody washes .
Everybody cleans .
Everybody cuts .
Everybody hauls .
`` But that 's the kind of lifestyle we 've always known .
We grew up poor people .
We had to hustle for everything .
We grew our own corn , our own potatoes .
We didn n't have money to spend in those specialty stores .
We learned to appreciate fresh ingredients and quality .
And we learned to cook .
We learned that to feed a lot of people , you could stretch a gumbo for hours and hours with rice and water .
`` That 's why we enjoy meeting people now and doing something for them . ''
