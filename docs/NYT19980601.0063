ATLANTA _ Your next fishing partner may have a 17-inch screen and a keyboard .
Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers and the Internet on a daily basis , Web sites do a much better job of representing the non-technical side of life .
Take fishing , for instance .
You 'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area ; tell you about the hottest lures ; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well .
A good place to start is at a Web site called The Fishing Network at http://www.iwn.com/fishing.html.
Because this is a national site , you start by clicking on the section of the country where you live .
Besides offering fishing tips for that section of the country , you 'll find some links that would be helpful to most fishermen , including ways to get local weather conditions .
Another good general interest site is called The World of Fishing at http://www.fishingworld.com/.
Some of the news stories and information here seems to be aimed at the professional bass fishermen and those who follow the action at bass tournaments .
But there are also sections that offer listings of fishing guides and others that take you to classified ads for used fishing equipment .
There also are links to the sites of several manufacturers of fishing equipment .
The most helpful part of this site is the section that offers forums on various types of fishing and fishing-related information .
You 'll be able to use these forums to discuss subjects such as lures , outboard motors and fishing spots with other anglers .
And if there is anything fishermen like as well as fishing , it 's talking about fishing .
Fly-fishing can almost seem like a separate sport .
Avid fly-fishermen often look down their noses at those who merely drown worms .
And learning to fly-fish is a lot more difficult , too .
But the rewards are enormous for those who enjoy it .
The art of making a delicate cast to just the right place is almost as much fun as catching a fish .
Oregon is famous for some great fly-fishing rivers including the Rogue , McKenzie , Smith and Umpqua .
So an Oregon-based site called the McKenzie Page is a terrific place to go .
You 'll find it at http://zebu.uoregon.edu/cgi-bin2/Mckenzie/Mckfrontend.pl.
A lot of the information is specific to Oregon rivers , but you 'll also find some general information , including some great photography of flies .
Today 's final site _ Flyfishing.com at http://www.flyfishing.com _ is much more general in nature and has lots of instructional material for beginners and seasoned fly-fishermen .
One especially good feature of the site is the database of information about various flies .
Even veteran fly-fishermen will enjoy looking through the many attempts to create a lure that looks just right to a trout .
