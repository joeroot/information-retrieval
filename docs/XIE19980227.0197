3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in S. Lebanon
JERUSALEM , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Three Israeli soldiers were killed and three others wounded Thursday in South Lebanon by Hezbollah ( Party of God ) forces , Israel Radio reported Friday .
The delay of the announcement was due to Israel 's military censorship which bans publicizing news of military casualties until the families of the victimized soldiers are informed .
The radio reported that the incident occurred Thursday afternoon when a long-range mortar shell fired by Hezbollah directly hit the Karkum outpost in the western sector of Israeli-declared South Lebanon Security Zone .
Israeli gunners retaliated the attack by blasting Hezbollah targets north of the security zone .
Reports from Lebanon said at least two Hezbollah gunmen were killed in a separate clash in the Wadi Saluki region .
The report said the killed soldiers were from the same unit as Nikolai Rappaport , a Russian immigrant soldier killed early the month during a clash with Hezbollah forces .
Rappaport was the first Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon this year .
The latest casualties brought to 4 the death toll of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon since the beginning of the year .
There has been an average 35 Israeli soldiers killed annually in South Lebanon since Israel 's establishment of the security zone in 1985 .
