UK 's Paymaster General Resigns over Loan
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Britain 's Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson resigned on Wednesday over the home loan to Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Mandelson two years ago .
In a letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair , Robinson blamed " more than 12 months of a highly charged political campaign " against him and insisted he had done nothing wrong .
The move came soon after Mandelson resigned earlier in the day over a 373,000 pounds ( 627,000 U.S. dollars ) loan from Robinson two years ago to buy a luxury house in west London .
Mandelson 's department is investigating a possible conflict between Robinson 's political and business interests .
