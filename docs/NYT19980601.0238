TURN ON , TUNE IN , CHECK OUT

SAN FRANCISCO _ A recent British study found that an increasing number of elderly people were mixed up , frightened , often belligerently defensive and sometimes happily oblivious because television had taken over their minds , at least temporarily .
According to a London Observer story on the study : `` The evidence is alarming .
It includes one 90-year-old woman who remembered the themes of television programs but forgot the identities of the main characters .
To compensate , she transposed their identities on to people she knew well , leading to bitter accusations against her family .
`` Among these were claims that her grandson was being led astray by prostitutes ; that her son-in-law , a retired doctor , was facing charges of assault for beating a man in the same room as her and that her doctor was a transvestite .
She also accused a ward sister of being a stripper . ''
Remember , this is in a country not heavily tuned in to Jerry Springer 's universe .
Anyone who has ever dealt with a parent or loved one suffering through Alzheimer 's disease , or related ailments , understands it 's one of life 's grayest emotional areas .
On the one hand , a thinking , loving person is slipping away , forgetting family members like fading pictures .
On the other , there is an element of grand , sad-funny humor to it all .
Some people say the humor is the only thing that gets them through .
What 's most disturbing about this study is that it 's from Britain .
You know , that island that gave the world Shakespeare and `` Masterpiece Theatre . ''
Let 's be honest here .
When it comes to bad television , we have it .
If any country is ripe for extending the ramifications of this study to its zenith , it is ours .
Television dominates our lives , our culture .
Many of us were raised on it .
The British may have created the Teletubbies , but we are the Teletubbies .
Already television is blamed for destroying the moral fabric of our nation _ from bad children 's programming to the MTV generation to parents who can tell you Ward Cleaver 's work phone number .
Just wait .
This television-is-poisoning-the-elderly thing is going to be the topic du jour among The Concerned Thinkers and People Who Worry .
Not all of us will be caught up in the emotional riot of Luddite finger-pointers and hand-wringing elder counselors .
Some of us will put a little faith in science , hoping for an Alzheimer 's miracle .
If it doesn n't come by the time we get ready to go , so be it .
We 'll be prepared .
In our wills we 'll make stipulations _ right next to that power of attorney clause _ that expressly detail what we want to watch .
Think about it .
It 's like turning this whole V-chip thing on yourself .
Censoring your mind before you can n't spell the word anymore .
For those of us with vision , this is an opportunity to shape our future reality .
Imagine a world where you 're the fifth `` Seinfeld '' cast member .
You could be the seventh friend on `` Friends . ''
If you start taping C-SPAN right now in anticipation , you could be a member of the British Parliament , shouting down your neighbors at the retirement home .
An optimist will not get sad or paranoid about what television will do to him in their wilted salad years .
Yeah , the mind is going to go for some people .
It 's the truly television-savvy who let it live on `` Green Acres '' or with Bob Newhart or as a rugged thinking person 's detective in `` Homicide : Life on the Street . ''
Imagine yourself imagining _ no , believing _ that you 're the third snobbish brother living a truly examined life along with `` Frasier '' and family .
The key is to plan now .
Most of us have been hoarding up pathetic television images for years , and the possibility of crossover-dream interference is more than likely .
You could buy the entire collection of `` Pee-wee 's Playhouse '' and live in a fantasy land free of worry .
Get the tapes ready for constant viewing .
It 's like planning your own elder-sitting .
You don n't want a lot of `` Dateline '' or `` Geraldo '' memories creeping in .
Television and movies have always played on our fascination with technology , portraying a world where we can live out our dreams .
Until this British study , who knew that we were carrying around just the right kind of faulty hardware to do the trick ?
Some of us already know what it 's like to watch people waste away .
Some of us already fear it 's in the genes , that it 's a horrible foregone conclusion .
Thinking like that is wearying .
Taking the glass-is-half-full approach gives hope to our fate .
Some of us are going to start taping the Golf Channel 24 hours a day .
The Travel Channel , too .
We 're going to walk the most beautiful fairways , strike the ball perfectly every time , then put the bags down and travel the world , soaking up its beauty while forgetting the dingy confines of our little warehouse , where vaguely familiar smiling faces come and call out our names .
We 're going where the reruns are brilliant and there are no commercials .
