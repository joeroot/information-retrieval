Boxer Lewis Camp Dismiss Unification Doubts
LONDON , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- British boxer Lennox Lewis 's manager Frank Maloney dismissed Saturday suggestions that the British boxer 's world heavyweight unification bout with Evander Holyfield could be in doubt .
The title showdown , which has taken months to set up , is due to take place in March next year .
But Holyfield 's attorney and adviser Jim Thomas is reported to have said there are issues - believed to be concerning the payment of undercard fighters and sponsorship - that are still to be sorted out .
Maloney , however , is unconcerned and insists the long-awaited bout , which is being backed by flamboyant promoter Don King , will still take place .
" There are issues because it is such a large contract , " he said .
" But we have no problems .
The Lennox Lewis team are very happy .
We will be there on March 13th .
" When I last spoke to Mr King he was pushing us for our signed contract , which he 's now got .
" So far as I 'm concerned there are no problems , it 's all systems go .
" Both fighters want the fight , both promotional teams - Jim Thomas and myself - we want the fight , Don King wants the fight .
So I don n't know what the problem is , " he added .
