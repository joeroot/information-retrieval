One Million More Northwest Farmers Rise above Poverty Line
LANZHOU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Over a million poor farmers in northwest China 's Gansu Province have got rid of poverty during 1998 .
The figure represents approximately 12 percent of the total number of people rose above the national poverty line during the year .
Some 1.84 million Gansu residents still live below the poverty line , down substantially from 12 million who suffered from inadequate food and clothing prior to introduction of the poverty relief campaign in 1983 .
Provincial officials attribute the decline to successful efforts to ease water shortages and soil erosion .
The province has increased the coverage of terraced fields to over 1.4 million ha , controlled soil erosion on over 60,000 sq.m . , and solved drinking water shortages for some 2.5 million people and over 2.8 million head of livestock .
Flexible bank credit policies have also contributed to the poverty relief achievements .
