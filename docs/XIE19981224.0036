News Analysis : Financial Crisis Offers Challenge for China 's Shipbuilding Business ( 1 )
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's shipbuilding industry is facing great challenges , as Japan and the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) , hit by the Asian financial crisis , have been lowering the cost of vessels in a bid to win more market shares .
Japan and the ROK received 1.79 million tons , equivalent to 1.25 billion U.S. dollars , of orders from Chinese shipping companies in the first nine months of this year alone , double 1997's figure .
The figures were released by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation ( CSSC ) which added that imported vessels now account for 80 percent of the country 's fleet .
In recent years Chinese shipbuilders secured more than one million tons of orders annually in the world market , but this year the figure is much lower .
The State Council and the Ministry of Communications have ordered shipping companies to purchase domestically-built vessels .
Leading ship owners have expressed sympathy for the problems facing the industry and promised to buy China-made vessels .
