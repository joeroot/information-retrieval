VAUGHN DELIVERS SLAM IN RED SOX DUGOUT
COLUMN-BOS ( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By DAN SHAUGHNESSY c.1998 The Boston Globe
NEW YORK _ Mo Vaughn snapped .
After watching his team nearly blow an 11 - 0 lead , and wind up facing the tying run at the plate in the bottom of the seventh Sunday , the big guy couldn n't take any more .
When the inning was over , he came off the field and tore into his teammates .
It was a first-class , five-star , Jack Nicholson nutty .
It will go down as the water-cooler-flyin ' , F-bombs-flyin ' , dugout-roof-shakin ' , don n't - be-jakin ' , buns-toastin ' , rump-roastin ' , Mo Vaughn Slam .
Mo wasn n't Gettin ' Jiggy Wit It .
No. Not at all .
The tirade turned things around for the Red Sox .
Boston got back on track and scored a couple of more runs to finish off a 13 - 7 , face-saving , series-squaring victory over the hated first-place New Yorkers .
Big Mo didn n't want to discuss his dugout implosion , and wouldn n't specify what was said , but admitted , `` I just get upset when I don n't feel we 're being aggressive enough .
Sometimes the only way to get things done is to go at people .
When I feel that approach is lost , that 's when something 's gon na happen .
If I have to do that every day , it will be done . ''
It was an impressive tantrum , mildly reminiscent of Terry O ' Reilly taking the tire iron to a car in Hartford , and Bruce Armstrong wielding a baseball bat while challenging his Patriot teammates .
The Sox had humbled the haughty New Yorkers , routing the estimable Andy Pettitte and scoring 11 times in the third inning .
But the Yankees started to creep back and in the seventh they cut Boston 's lead to 11 - 7 and had the bases loaded with no outs .
It wasn n't until People 's Choice Lou Merloni saved the day with a spectacular backhanded stab that led to an inning-ending double play that the Sox got back to the safety of their dugout .
It wasn n't safe for long .
Mo looked like Curley when he hears `` Three Blind Mice '' in the Stooges boxing episode .
Niagara Falls .
The big first baseman started yelling at no one in particular .
His language was loud and foul .
He stormed up and down the dugout , then toppled a green water cooler .
Not since Ed Romero flung the Gatorade here in 1989 ( Romero was upset that Joe Morgan had the audacity to pinch hit for him ) had a Boston player been so angry in the Apple .
Merloni and Pedro Martinez _ another key player on this wacky day at the Zoo _ both thought the diatribe was effective .
`` It was good , '' said Merloni .
`` It needed to be said .
We can n't win like that .
We need to be aggressive .
You could sense that we lost that .
He 's the leader of this team and he got into it a little bit . ''
`` It was very good , '' added Pedro .
`` 'Cause it got us back into the same mood as when the game started . ''
Manager Jimy Williams said he didn n't mind a team leader making a statement .
Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said , `` I 've seen a couple like that .
Everybody just went about their business .
They just went out and played their game .
I didn n't see anybody panicking out there . ''
Dennis Eckersley , who was on the mound for four of the eight batters in the inning and got out of the jam , said it was possible that some players might interpret the outburst as finger-pointing , but said , `` I didn n't think he was talking to anyone in particular .
He has a right to do what he wants .
Guys who play every day , they get crazy sometimes . ''
John Wasdin , Ron Mahay , and Eckersley all struggled in the sinful seventh , and Vaughn 's blasts probably were aimed at them .
`` When you 've got a team like that down , you 've got to keep them down , '' said Vaughn .
`` We 're up a bunch of runs and all of a sudden we 're giving guys free passes for no reason .
We 've discussed staying focused for nine innings .
We couldn n't let this one slip away .
Today we got off to a nice start , but we went to sleep for a little while . ''
So Mo woke everybody up .
And it worked .
What could have been the most demoralizing loss of the season wound up being a team-lifting win .
The insufferable New Yorkers may indeed have the best team in baseball , the Team of the Century , and the team against which all future juggernauts will be measured .
They may finish with a better winning percentage than the 1906 Cubs ( 116 - 36 , . 763 ) and they actually might do the unthinkable and satisfy George Steinbrenner .
But let the record show that for one day , the Red Sox finally beat up on the Yanks .
On the last day of May , in front of a capacity crowd in the House That Ruth Built , your Red Sox administered a butt-kicking that could carry them into the summer with confidence .
The Red Sox are still 7 1 / 2 games behind New York ( nine in the loss column ) , but the final two games of the home-and-home series served to remind New Yorkers that Boston will not go down gently and that any team with Martinez and a healthy Bret Saberhagen is dangerous in a short , October series .
And for at least a little while longer , Mo Vaughn is around to make sure the Sox don n't lose their way .
