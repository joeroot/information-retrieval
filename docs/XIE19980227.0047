S. Africa Bans Mercenary Activities
JOHANNESBURG , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- South Africa 's National Assembly Thursday approved the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Bill , which bans mercenary activities by South Africans , the South African Press Association ( SAPA ) reported .
Defense Minister Joe Modise , who introduced the bill , said it effectively precluded any South African citizen , resident or company from participating as a combatant in armed conflict for private gain , nationally or internationally .
It was not intended to obstruct anyone from rendering legitimate , lawful military assistance , where such activity constituted technical and training support to democratically-elected governments by private companies or individuals , Modise said .
All activities falling within the definition of foreign military assistance would be regulated by permits issued via the National Conventional Arms Control Committee ( NCACC ) .
However , humanitarian and civilian activities aimed at relieving the plight of civilians in areas of armed conflict were exempt from the permit process , he said .
Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal , who is also chairman of the NCACC , said it was necessary for South Africa to conduct its foreign relations in ways which were constructive and helpful to its neighbors and the world community .
Mercenary activities are obviously counter-productive to nation-to-nation relations , he said .
Asmal said South Africa had not been pushed into taking this step because of foreign pressure .
" We take orders not from foreign powers or interests , but from our own conscience and sense of what is right and wrong . "
" This measure , therefore , is constitutionally necessary , it is in the interests of our foreign relations and it is the right thing to do . "
Asmal said it should be no secret or surprise that considerable international interest had been shown in the South African initiative .
