NEW YORK _
Dear Diary :
Visiting an editor at Random House , I stepped into a crowded elevator and found myself pressed close to the control panel .
`` Has everybody got their floors ? ''
I asked .
After a moment 's silence , a young female voice from the rear said , `` His or her . ''
`` I beg your pardon ? ''
I said .
`` His or her .
It 's ` Has everybody got his or her floors ? ' Your pronouns don n't agree . ''
`` And shouldn n't it be ` his or her floor , ' not ` floors ' ? ''
a young man piped up .
`` Each of us gets off at only one floor . ''
`` And wouldn n't it be better to say ` Does everybody have ? ' rather than ` Has everybody got ? '' ' a third voice chimed in .
I stood corrected _ and red faced .
But I was glad to know that good grammar is alive and well .

Daniele Di Piazza was walking along upper Park Avenue with her son , Fabrizio , and his puppy named Squid , who as her name suggests is as black as ink .
A little girl , about 10 , beautifully dressed , accompanied by her father and walking toward them , spotted Squid and began to jump up and down with excitement .
`` Oh Daddy , that is the perfect dog , '' she exclaimed .
`` I want one just like that _ except in brown . ''
The next Anna Wintour ?
Kathleen Dillon heard this one from her eye doctor : An Italian friend of his was visiting after a long absence from New York .
Over dinner , he talked about how impressed he was with the cleanliness of the city and the quality-of-life campaign .
However , he said he was surprised that the campaign seemed to condone what appeared to be a burgeoning of prostitution .
How had he come to that conclusion ?
his host asked .
Well , he said , everywhere he went there were groups of well-dressed women idling in doorways smoking .
Chalk up one surprising result of the city 's anti-smoking regulations .
The woman waiting to board the bus was obviously irritated at the number of people using the entrance door to get off .
As the last to exit , a well-dressed middle-aged man , descended , she called out : `` Why don n't you get off at the back ? ''
He looked at her indignantly : `` I 'm not a tourist , '' he said .
Dear Diary :
My father , Dr. Harry Goldin , a physician who died recently in his 100th year , was renowned among his patients for his quick wit .
Over the week of our shiva observance , my brother , sister and I were regaled with many anecdotes , but one stands out .
A former patient told us that although she had moved away years ago , she continued to consult my father by phone on all significant issues relating to her health .
A year or two ago , she said , she called my father to ask his advice on a course of treatment that had been recommended by her regular physician .
After hearing my father 's views , she asked , `` Dr. Goldin , shouldn n't I get a second opinion ? ''
`` Of course , '' he replied .
`` Call me again tomorrow . ''

Dear Diary :
Needing a tennis partner , I checked out the clubhouse bulletin board where the players list themselves only by their first names .
I rang up `` Anita , '' giving her only my first name and , because she had a young-sounding voice and I didn n't want her to be aghast on seeing my gray hair , added my age .
That was OK , Anita said , and she , too , offered her age .
When she gave me her last name , I mentioned that was the same name as the college I attended .
She had attended it too , she said , and after a brief pause , asked my last name .
`` I know you , Sara , '' she exclaimed .
She gave her name .
It turned out that not only had we gone to the same college , but we had both been part of the college theater group .
And we knew that we had both lied about our ages !

A further communique regarding sea gulls .
Ellen Burke wasn n't too impressed about the story of the sea gull in Bayside that dropped a sesame bagel .
The action , she says , is in Robert Moses State Park where apparently the gulls are not only fearless but deft _ one recently swooped down , plucked her niece 's hot dog right out of its bun and soared off triumphantly .
Manhattan birds are more discriminating .
Mikel Stettner saw this note attached to a bench in Central Park : `` The person who brings a bagel every morning for the birds .
Please don n't bring ` Everything Bagels . ' The birds don n't like it .
Thank you . ''
Sean Sullivan paid $ 1 for a secondhand address book recently , and what an address book it turned out to be .
He bought it at a yard sale in East Hampton at the home of a famous theatrical couple , and he 's still mesmerized by his glimpse into another world , and the juxtaposition of the celebrated and the mundane .
There 's Dick Cavett , Cy Coleman and Betty Comden next to Cable Vision and the Cleaners , Joseph Heller and Don Hewitt along with the Handyman and Hardware store , and Kurt Vonnegut listed with the Villa sandwich shop .
Why was Lauren Bacall crossed out _ a falling out or a change of phone number ?
Why five masseuses ?
In fact , why was the address book in the sale anyway ?
Talk about getting your money 's worth .
Dear Diary :
On a recent trip to New York , I had occasion to visit the main post office , where I overheard the following :
Customer to postal clerk : `` Do you have any angel stamps ? ''
Postal Clerk : `` We have books of 20 stamps for $ 6.40 . ''
Customer : `` I don n't want a book .
Don n't you have any loose angels ? ''
_ JACQUIE TROTTE
On hearing of the reopening of the Butterfly Zone at the Bronx Zoo :
The loveliest word , one can n't deny ,
In English is the butterfly ;
And in Spain there 's none who knows a
Sound more sweet than mariposa .
The French will shrug and then intone ,
`` Le plus charmant , c ' est papillon . ''
But who would guess the Germans sing
Lieder to a Schmetterling ? ''

The recent `` Take Your Daughters to Work Day '' reminded James B. Fishman , a lawyer , of the day some years ago when he took his daughter , Sarah , then 5 , to his office during vacation .
Sarah spent most of the day coloring , making photocopies and snacking .
For an hour , she sat with the receptionist .
When she returned to kindergarten , her teacher asked the children what they had done during vacation .
Sarah raised her hand and said `` I went to work with my Daddy . ''
`` Where does your Daddy work ? ''
the teacher asked .
`` He works at a place called `` Hello , Law Office , '' she answered .
