S. African Squad Begins Arms Blitz in Mozambique
JOHANNESBURG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- A crack South African police unit has entered Mozambique on a three-week arms destruction mission , the biggest cross-border operation of its kind ever , The Star newspaper reported Monday .
The squad , consisting of 33 special task force , bomb disposal and firearm experts headed by a police director , crossed the border early Sunday and will be assisted by 12 of their Mozambican colleagues , said the local newspaper .
The operation , code-named Rachel IV , follows three previous raids on arms caches in the neighboring state in which more than 300 tons of firearms and 40 million rounds of ammunition were blown to shrapnel with powerful explosives .
The Rachel operations were originally decided upon to stop the flow of illegal firearms into South Africa before they cross the border , and to safeguard people living in rural and remote areas of Mozambique where most of the weapons are stashed .
Since Mozambican authorities have neither the financial means nor the expertise to destroy the caches , the South African police supplied explosives , landmine-resistant vehicles and other specialized equipment as well as highly trained senior policemen to fulfill the missions .
South African Police Service ( SAPS ) assistant commissioner Suiker Britz , who is in command of the joint South African-Mozambican operations , said a substantial number of arms caches had been identified and plotted on maps .
He said although only about 60 of the hidden venues would be excavated and destroyed in the 20 days that the Rachel IV operation would last , the hardware expected to be destroyed would be more than the three previous ventures combined .
Most of the hidden hardware originated from eastern European countries and some of it was left over from the Mozambican civil war , the Star report said .
Police said the entire haul was still potent and suitable for the underground market .
Britz said the Rachel ventures were crippling illegal gun-running operations into South Africa and were dealing blows to unscrupulous smuggling syndicates .
