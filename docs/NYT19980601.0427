FARMERS SEEKING DROUGHT-STRICKEN STATUS IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By KEVIN MORAN c.1998 Houston Chronicle
GALVESTON , Texas _ With no crops in the ground and scant prospect of significant rain , farmers in Galveston and other southeast Texas counties are expecting major losses this year .
To help soften the blow , farmers are asking county commissioners courts to start the paperwork for declaration of their counties by state and federal officials as drought-stricken areas qualified for insurance payments , low-cost loans and other possible aid .
Although Galveston County was only a half-inch off on its normal annual rainfall as the new month began , Monday marked the 76th day with no rain on about 30,000 acres of land on which milo , corn and soybeans normally would have been growing this time of year , farmer and rancher J.B .
Evans told commissioners court .
`` The problem is not how much rain we had , but when it fell , '' Evans said after addressing commissioners .
March 's 1.92 inches marked the last rain in Galveston County , Evans said .
Nearly 13 inches fell in January and February .
Early rains kept farmers from preparing fields for planting and lack of rain since late March left fields without the moisture needed for planting seed , Evans said .
`` We should have had five inches of rain in May , '' Evans said .
`` It 's affected a lot of people , even the rice farmers , '' said Evans , who said his losses could hit $ 150 , 000 .
`` Most of them got their rice planted , but with the weather the way it is , it 's going to kill the quality of the crops . ''
Evans said he has talked with officials at the National Weather Service about the lack of rain .
`` The national weather bureau is not quite ready to holler ` disaster ' because we 're actually only a half-inch off in annual rainfall , '' he said .
Evans lives in Algoa in western Galveston County but plants crops on about 1,200 acres of land near La Marque .
Galveston County Judge Jim Yarbrough agreed Monday to forward a request for disaster declaration to state officials as soon as he gets the necessary paperwork in hand .
Doris Campbell , director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Farm Service Agency in Galveston and Brazoria counties , plans to ask Brazoria County Judge John Willey to do the same .
Officials from state and federal agencies will meet at her Angleton office Tuesday to discuss drought problems and assess existing and future agricultural losses , Campbell said .
The disaster declaration process is especially important in making crop insurance claims , Evans said .
Insurers `` don n't recognize drought as a cause for claims on insurance unless it 's documented through the county , '' Evans said .
Evans said farmers might be able to plant soybeans if they get enough rain by June 15 to moisten fields .
