World Bank Backs Structural Adjustment for Armenia
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The World Bank Wednesday announced the approval of 65 million U.S. dollars equivalent for the Third Structural Adjustment Credit to Armenia .
The Bank decided to increase the originally planned amount of the credit by additional 15 million dollars equivalent to help the Armenian Government accommodate the impact of the crisis in Russia and thus to ease the social costs of economic adjustment .
The interest-free credit will support the government 's program to consolidate macroeconomic stability and to lay the foundations for sustained private-sector led economic growth over the medium term .
The credit will be utilized to support the government 's efforts to accelerate reforms in key sectors such as public sector management , private sector development , and energy and social protection , and will improve financing mechanisms in both health and education .
The credit will be provided by the International Development Association ( IDA ) , the World Bank 's concessionary lending wing for developing countries .
Since joining the World Bank in 1992 and the IDA in 1993 , IDA commitments to the country total some 428.4 million dollars for 18 projects .
