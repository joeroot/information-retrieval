Australia Election Campaign : Labor Party Closes Gap ,
CANBERRA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) has narrowed the gap but the ruling coalition would have won an election held last weekend , the latest poll in this week 's Bulletin magazine has found .
The poll by Mark Textor 's Australasian Research Strategies found the coalition , comprising the Liberal Party and National Party , would have suffered a swing of only 2.2 percent last weekend , returning John Howard with a majority of about 20 seats .
However it found primary support for the ALP surged by two points in the third week of the campaign to 36 percent , still five points behind the coalition on 41 percent of primary votes .
On a two-party basis , the coalition led 51.5 percent to Labor 's 48.5 percent .
However , the Bulletin poll is the only remaining major poll to put the coalition ahead , with Newspoll and AC Nielsen placing the ALP marginally ahead .
As the campaign for the October 3 election heads into the fourth week , the coalition will keep the focus of its re-election strategy on its work for the dole scheme .
Prime Minister John Howard Sunday announced a further 100 million Australian dollars ( 59 million U.S. dollars ) over four years to extend the work for the dole scheme to year 12 students without work or not in training three months after finishing school .
But the proposal has drawn criticism from ALP , which said the government was seeking to portray the scheme as a solution to youth unemployment to divert attention from the high rate of joblessness among young people .
Opposition leader Kim Beazley , who has flagged employment as the most important issue for the campaign , said Howard 's election platform would not provide a single job and he was reinforcing failure by expanding the scheme .
Promoting his tax reform in Sydney , Howard warned that the nation would pay a price by becoming a weaker and more vulnerable economy if it did not reform its tax system .
" We have seen with Japan what happens when economies turn away from necessary reform .
If the Japanese had fixed their banking system eight or nine years ago , Japan would now be a lot stronger and would not be seen as being in real difficulty , " he said .
He said he had a plan that includes a goods and services tax package .
That may not be popular or easy , but it is in the voters ' interest to have a stronger economy which could withstand international economic turmoil .
Kim Beazley , while hitting back at claims that Labor had no plan for tax reform , said his party 's tax credit system was the only new idea being put forward in the election campaign .
" We have substantial tax reform policies , including the only new idea on offer and that 's our 10 cents in the dollar tax credit for the bulk of Australian families and for workers , " he said .
In a speech to about 500 members of Chinese community in Sydney , Beazley stepped up his attack on the government 's approach to One Nation Party , highlighting Labor 's multi-culturalism credentials .
Beazley accused the coalition of cowardice and immorality for feeding preferences to Pauline Hanson 's One Nation Party at Queensland election , in which the One Nation Party won 11 state MP seats .
