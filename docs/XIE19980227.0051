S. African Parliament OKs Sale of Airports
JOHANNESBURG , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- South Africa 's National Assembly Thursday approved a bill , giving the green light to the sale of a 20-percent share in the Airports Company to a strategic equity partner , South African Press Association ( SAPA ) reported .
Introducing the Airports Company Amendment Bill , Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said it was a great step forward in the government 's privatization program .
Five foreign operators are in the running for the 20-percent share , and Maharaj said earlier this month that the selection of the successful candidate was entering the final stages .
In addition to the 20 percent , 10 percent of the company 's shares would be placed in the National Empowerment Fund , 10 percent would go to black empowerment investors and nine percent to company staff .
The state , which at present is the sole shareholder , will hold the remaining 51 percent .
The bill was read a second time with the support of all parties except the Freedom Front , which said it was unhappy that the cabinet , rather than parliament , would give the final go-ahead for the transfer of shares under the new arrangement .
The National Assembly also unanimously approved the South African Maritime Safety Authority Bill , which creates a new authority responsible for administering laws designed to ensure safe and clean seas , SAPA said .
Maharaj said the new body would operate under a board appointed by him , and would operate essentially on business principles .
The authority would be empowered to impose levies on ships in South Africa 's territorial waters .
It was supposed to begin operating on April 1 this year .
