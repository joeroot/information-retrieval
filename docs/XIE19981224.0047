Gunmen Still Havoc Security in Somali Capital
MOGADISHU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Freelance gunmen keep posing havoc for both the ordinary civilians and the aid agencies in Mogadishu as the insecurity further worsens in the Somali capital .
A group of 15 heavily armed men have stormed into a large vehicle workshop owned by the Somali Red Crescent Society ( SRCS ) in Towfiq area controlled by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid Wednesday evening .
According to neighbors from the area , a quarrel between former SRCS workers in the workshop and some of their clan relative gunmen had resulted the total capture of the workshop by gunmen from the Sarur subclan of Habar Gidir loyal to Hussein Aidid .
The gunmen have threatened they will peel off the roofs of the whole workshop if their demands for unspecified amount of money is not met .
Elders from the area supported by officials from the Islamic courts of Shirole and lfka Halan have tried to mediate the issue , however the gunmen have fired several shots to warn the Sheikhs not to get any closer .
The shooting against the Sheikhs bad angered the militia officials of their respective courts who in return have launched a joint attack using three battle wagons and more than 50 heavily armed gunmen against the gunmen in the workshop .
Nevertheless , at least one gunman was killed and another one wounded as the two sides have exchanged heavy gunfire in and around the workshop .
The Islamic militiamen have taken the upper hand as the gunmen in the workshop had apparently ran out of ammunition .
The Islamic courts militiamen had then stormed into the premises and managed to apprehend eight of the culprits while five more have escaped for their lives .
The Islamic judges in those courts who still maintain the facility of the Somali Red Crescent Society in Towfiq area of South Mogadishu said the gunmen will be tried according to the Islamic Sharia laws .
According to one of the local employees of the agency , the workshop was looted early in the beginning of the civil war , but the building itself remained intact guarded by former employees for the Red Crescent .
The workshop was used for maintaining the vehicles of the international agencies during the late regime .
Meanwhile , two men were killed by unidentified gunmen near Al - Baraka junction of South Mogadishu Wednesday night .
The deceased belonging to the Suleman subclan of Habar Gidir loyal to Hussein Aidid were running their own business working in an elementary shop .
The reason for the killing is not known , however people from the area attributed the killing to a retaliation against the Suleman men who two days ago killed a fellow man of the assailants belonging to the Dudubleh subclan also supporting Hussein Aidid in South Mogadishu .
