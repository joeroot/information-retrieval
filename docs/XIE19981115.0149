Iraq Assures Security Council of Unconditional Cooperation
UNITED NATIONS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraq assured its unconditional cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspection mission on Saturday night .
It said that a previous letter allowing the return of the U.N. arms inspection teams , sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday morning from Baghdad , was " unconditional and unequivocal " and quite separate from an accompanying annex voicing Iraqi wishes .
The annex was said to have become the focus of the on-going discussion here by the 15-member Security Council , and one U.N. official said that " this could be a long night " for the Council .
Earlier , the United States said the annex set unacceptable conditions for the return of U.N. arms inspectors .
Nizar Hamdoon , Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations , said he first informed the council president , Peter Burleigh of the United States , orally and later in a letter , that the annex " contains the views and preferences of the government of Iraq " on a comprehensive review that the council had previously agreed to carry out on how far Baghdad had complied with relevant U.N. resolutions .
" These views are not linked to the clear and unconditional decision of the Iraqi Government to resume dealing with UNSCOM ( the U.N. Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction ) and the IAEA ( the International Atomic Energy Agency ) , " said the letter , which was translated from the original Arabic and could be circulated as a formal document of the council .
The Iraqi envoy told reporters here that the council president promised to inform members about the explanatory letter , which Burleigh , also charge d ' affaires of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations , had requested .
Hamdoon said he sent the letter " so that no further confusion should be acceptable . "
" The issue right now is to resume the cooperation between Iraq and UNSCOM .
Our view on the comprehensive review could be different than the views of the council , " he added .
On Saturday morning , Annan described the Iraqi letter as " positive , " saying that he believed Iraq 's offer met demands of solving the crisis , but later Washington termed it as unacceptable .
