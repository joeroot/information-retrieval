News Corp Launches New Broadcasting Company for
CANBERRA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The billionaire media baron Rupert Murdoch is launching a new company , News Broadcasting Australia Pty Ltd , by using new wave of broadcasting technology to expand its manor in Australia .
The move is designed to position News Corp in a nascent market delivering broadcast content over platforms such as the Internet .
" It 's a very wide brief .
It covers all areas of broadcasting , " Jim Blomfield , formerly head of News Corp 's digital satellite operation in Tokyo and chief executive of the new company , was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying Thursday .
Cross media ownership laws in Australia prevent Murdoch controlling a television station and newspaper in the same city .
As a result News Corp can not hold a broadcasting licence in Australia because of its wide newspaper interests .
But new technology is moving in the company 's favor to allow it to start transmitting through means other than radio waves .
Murdoch has said recently that new technology would sweep away all efforts by the governments to control media ownership .
In launching the new company , Lachlan Murdoch , chief executive of News Corp 's Australian arm , News Ltd , said the new company aimed to " provide the Australian public with greater freedom of choice in entertainment and information services " .
" News ' experience at the forefront of digital broadcasting and content development around the world puts it in a unique position to be a driving force in giving the public the competitive choice of programming to which they are entitled , " he added .
News is also the 50 percent owner of pay TV company Foxtel and has developed the film and television production house Fox Studios in Sydney .
" News Broadcasting aims to bring the full benefit of rapidly advancing broadcasting services to Australian homes as soon as possible , " Murdoch said .
