Aston Villa Tastes First Defeat at Premier League
LONDON , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- A hat-trick from Robbie Fowler gave Liverpool a 4 - 2 victory over Aston Villa , which tasted its first defeat of the season at the English Premier League on Saturday .
The top three all lost as second-placed Manchester United went down 3 - 1 at Sheffield Wednesday and third-placed Arsenal slipped 1 - 0 away to Wimbledon .
Those results allowed Chelsea and Leeds United to close ground , with a 4 - 2 success at Leicester City and a 4 - 1 victory over Charlton Athletic respectively .
Liverpool had won only once in their previous nine league games but roared 2 - 0 ahead after seven minutes with headers by Paul Ince and Fowler .
There was end-to-end action and chances galore but no more goals until Dion Dublin pulled one back two minutes into the second half .
Fowler restored the two-goal advantage only for Dublin , with his seventh goal in three games since joining Villa from Coventry City , to make it 3 - 2.
Fowler struck again for 4 - 2 and Villa then had Stan Collymore sent off for a second booking in the 68th minute .
Dublin missed a chance for his second successive hat-trick as David James brilliantly saved his penalty after the keeper had brought down Julian Joachim .
" It was a wonderful game and a great performance by my pla yers , " said Liverpool coach Gerard Houllier .
Sheffield Wednesday had only one win in their last 10 games but a bad error by Peter Schmeichel , who let Niclas Alexandersson 's shot slip through his hands , allowed them to go ahead after 14 minutes .
Andy Cole equalised but a second for Alexandersson and one by Wim Jonk gave Wednesday the points .
A 77th minute Efan Ekoku goal was enough for Wimbledon to beat Arsenal but a bigger worry for coach Arsene Wenger will be the injuries received by Patrick Viera and Dennis Bergkamp that makes both doubtful for Wednesday 's European Champions ' League game against RC Lens .
" We were not aggressive enough , they won more of the fights , " said Wenger .
Southampton climbed off the bottom for the first time this season with a 2 - 0 win at Blackburn Rovers , the losers dropping to last place .
Matt Oakley , after four minutes , and Steve Basham , a minute from time , earned Saints their first away win of the season .
Tottenham Hotspur beat 10-man Nottingham Forest 2 - 0 and Mi ddlesbrough beat Coventry by the same score .
There were 28 goals in the day 's eight games , an average of 3.5 per match , which should hoist the premier league from last place in Europe 's goals-per-game standings .
Derby County play West Ham United on Sunday and Everton face Newcastle United on Monday .
