& HT ; Can Jordan prevail again ?

ATLANTA _ Is it possible to win a game before it even starts , to catapult a team to the NBA Finals on the force of sheer will and mental influence ?
Could Michael Jordan be that good ?
Maybe so .
It 's too simple to say the Chicago Bulls begin their quest for a second three-peat Wednesday in Salt Lake City against the Utah Jazz as much because of Jordan 's words and determination as his skill .
But it is indisputable that his team follows his lead , and he has not abused such responsibility .
`` My job is to keep it together , '' Jordan said .
`` Sometimes to score , but also sometimes to encourage and sometimes to push . ''
After the Indiana Pacers won Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals at Market Square Arena on Friday , the feeling permeated that the Bulls were ripe for the picking .
The champions , who prided themselves on their ability to close out teams on the brink , did not deliver the deciding blow .
The series , thought to be another Chicago short-order formality , was tied at 3 - 3.
So in the postgame press conference , Jordan issued an uncharacteristic public assurance .
`` We 're going to win Game 7 , '' he said .
`` I don n't make promises , ( even ) to my wife , but we will win Game 7. ''
Why did Jordan make such a departure ?
`` I jumped on it so quickly so my players wouldn n't let that thinking seep into their minds , '' Jordan said .
`` I put it out there .
Game 7 was a do-or-die game .
There were going to be a lot of questions about whether we were vulnerable or not .
I wanted them all to come into the game believing we would win .
That 's why I jumped on it right away . ''
His thinking seemed to affect his team .
`` I think Michael said what we all needed to hear , '' guard Steve Kerr said .
`` If he 's saying we 're going to win , it gives us all confidence .
We needed to feel that way going into Game 7. ''
At halftime of Sunday 's 88 - 83 victory , Jordan tore into his team , demanding that players ignore the officials and `` shut up and play '' because their concentration was wavering .
They did as Jordan demanded .
Meanwhile , M.J . 's shooting eye was blurry ( 9-for-25 shooting ) , but his focus was centered .
His teammates , particularly Toni Kukoc ( 21 points ) were significant .
In an exhausting effort , Jordan pulled down nine rebounds , had eight assists and shut down Reggie Miller in the second half .
`` That 's why he 's the best in the league , probably the best player ever , '' Indiana coach Larry Bird said .
`` When I played , if the shot wasn n't there , I did other things to help the team .
It 's the same with Michael .
He picked it up in other areas . ''
But now it 's on to Utah , which many believe will end the Bulls ' run .
The fear factor Chicago once brought into a championship series no longer exists .
But they are 5 - 0 in championship series .
`` Is the swagger gone ?
Probably , '' Jordan admitted .
`` Maybe we 've become a little cocky , with a swagger .
But that 's just human nature .
Nobody 's taken what we have .
`` When you 're going for ( the title ) the third time , it 's not uncommon to lose focus , to fight against yourself to excel .
There are so many expectations people have , it 's harder to live up to them . ''
The last time the people of Utah saw Jordan in the playoffs _ in last year 's Game 5 of the finals _ he was ill with stomach flu .
He scored 37 in a critical Chicago victory .
That 's will .
Is one more title left in Jordan 's bottomless well ?
`` Sure , '' he said .
`` We 're fighting an uphill battle , but we haven n't lost our confidence .
...
( In Utah ) , I won n't stay in Park City ( like last year , where he got sick ) .
I won n't have any pizza .
I want to be ready .
Physically , we have to take care of our bodies .
We 're tired , but our hearts are not .
If people want to believe we 're beatable , fine .
But we still have to play the games . ''
