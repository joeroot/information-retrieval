UNDATED : full for long .
Because weight loss ultimately relies on using more calories than you consume , and because protein sources are high in calories , weight loss requires consuming smaller amounts .
Carbohydrates have long been the mainstay of most weight-loss diets for exactly the opposite reason : They are relatively low in calories and high in bulk .
Calorie for calorie , you can eat more of them and feel more full .
But the Sugar Busters diet does not allow potatoes or anything made from white rice or white flour , including bread , bagels and pasta .
An added risk , ironically , is that the high-protein / low carbohydrate diet will work too well .
Restricting carbohydrates can cause the body to start breaking down some of the fat stored in cells , but that breakdown can result in ketosis , a nutritional disease that causes bad breath as well as diarrhea , headaches , weakness , low blood pressure , fatigue and sleeplessness , according to Anderson .
`` The most serious side effect is that , if kept up over a long time , these diets can cause kidney and liver damage , '' she said .
Ultimately , you might be busting more than sugar .
