All the brouhaha last week over the dropping of remedial classes at the City University of New York , one of the nation 's largest systems , would make many people think that remediation was a multicultural course invented by CUNY professors .
They would be wrong .
In 1995 , 78 percent of America 's colleges offered such classes , up from 73 percent in 1988 .
Although they were most prevalent at public community colleges ( 96 percent of them offered these courses in 1995 ) , they were common at four-year colleges , too , with 72 percent offering the courses .
Clifford Adelman , a senior research analyst at the Department of Education , found that almost half of all college students took at least one class to prepare them for college-level work .
At CUNY last year , 46 percent of students entering four-year colleges failed one or more of the placement examinations in reading , writing and math .
At the California State University System , about half the freshmen need such classes to acclimate them to the rigors of academia .
In the Ivy League , the official line is that there are no remedial courses or underprepared students , but these institutions typically provide help in different guises .
Harvard and Yale , for instance , offer peer tutors and a writing center .
At the University of Chicago , a handful of students are directed each year to a course called essential mathematics that begins with arithmetic , algebra and geometry _ comparable to the remedial math courses at CUNY .
So why are so many high-school graduates unprepared for college ?
One explanation , educators say , is that there is a gap between what many secondary schools expect their students to know and what college professors require , and that there has not been enough coordination between them .
Another is that many high schools offer preparatory courses but students fail to take them , either because they are not planning to go to college or because they think they can get by without them .
In some cases , they get weak instruction ; sometimes they do poorly .
`` Students have been allowed to coast , '' said Joseph Creech , director for educational policies at the Southern Regional Education Board in Atlanta .
`` If students are going to have to be able to do certain things when they get to college , then we have to make these expectations clear in high school , and even in middle school . ''
At one time many of these ill-prepared students simply did not go to college .
But in a technology-driven , information-based economy , where a college diploma is a passport to a higher standard of living , more students are continuing their education .
But a growing number of university administrators and college officials do not see this trend as good news .
To them , each remedial student represents a failure , and wasted resources _ a job that has to be done at least twice thus diverting colleges from their real mission of providing higher education .
Remediation is such a dirty word that some colleges will not even admit to offering it , although their catalogs list courses in algebra , grammar and other subjects many students routinely take in high school .
`` There is a sense that it is despoiling the environment , '' said H. Patrick Swygert , president of Howard University in Washington .
`` Remediation _ the word _ is verboten on this campus because it carries with it all the stigma that its opponents have trotted out that students who need it are less than fully qualified .
`` Some people do not qualify intellectually or have the inclination to do the hard intellectual work required in college , '' Swygert added .
`` The great tragedy is that by removing remedial classes , that is not who is being screened out .
The numbers suggest that once students navigate the remedial classes , many go on to successful college careers . ''
Few colleges have approached moving remediation off campus with the fervor of the trustees at the CUNY , who despite widespread protests from faculty and students , voted last week to phase out remedial classes at their four-year colleges by 2001 .
Students failing placement exams will be directed to intensive summer or weekend classes , or to the two-year community colleges .
No one knows how many of these students would be able to complete these courses quickly , how many will opt for community colleges or how many will choose other four-year colleges or simply drop out in frustration .
But CUNY is not alone in trying to reduce its remediation .
Some universities , like the University of Maryland , are trying to foster closer coordination between secondary schools and colleges about what ground will be covered in certain courses .
The California State University , the largest public university in the country with 360,000 students , has set a goal of reducing the percentage of freshmen needing remediation to 10 percent by 2007 from more than 50 percent now .
The trustees , who had hoped to move faster , scaled back in the face of criticisms that they would penalize immigrants and minority students who had attended poor high schools and fared poorly in placement exams .
Charles Reed , who became chancellor of California State University system in March , said he would like to follow a program similar to the one he introduced at the University of Florida in 1985 , where it offers no remedial courses ; students needing them must go to community colleges or other institutions .
The students , however , can still register for university classes at the same time .
`` There are always going to be some students who need remediation , '' Reed said .
`` But universities are not as well prepared to do remediation as the community colleges . ''
Another critical part of the plan , he said , is to give the college placement tests to high school students _ preferably by the 10th grade _ `` as a wake-up call . ''
That way students can see where they are weak and still have time to improve .
Does it work in Florida ?
Partly .
Officials at the University of Florida say that only 10 percent of the students need remedial work _ well below the figure at CUNY and Cal State .
The figure is lower in part because the university takes in many of its students after they have already completed some credits elsewhere .
But even under the Florida system , students do not always whiz through their remedial courses .
Chuck Lindsey , director of general education at Florida Gulf Coast University , said that some students simply skip the hours they should spend learning basics and computer skills .
`` They just keep taking the class until they pass it , '' he said .
So Florida has taken one more step .
The state recently passed a law requiring that students taking remedial courses repeatedly will be charged the full price of the course , not the subsidized price available to local students .
In the meantime , Reed said , the number of students needing remediation at Florida 's community colleges continues to grow .
