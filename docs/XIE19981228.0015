Annan Raps at Rebel Offensives in Sierra Leone
UNITED NATIONS , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Sunday lashed out at the rebels ' refusal to put down their weapons and called them to end their on-going military actions in Sierra Leone , a U.N. statement said .
The statement , issued on Sunday through Annan 's spokesman , said that he " condemns the refusal of the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) and junta remnants to lay down their arms as well as their continuing military actions . "
The U.N. chief , who is extremely concerned over the latest news of rebel armed activities in the West African country , voiced his hope " to take this opportunity to emphasize the unacceptability of attempting to overthrow duly-elected government by force , " the statement said .
" He appeals to the rebels to lay down their arms at once and to enter the peace process without preconditions , " the statement added .
The statement came as fierce fighting was reported in the town of Makeni in northern Sierra Leone .
The rebels have stepped up a campaign of hit-and-run attacks since October , prompting the United Nations to evacuate part of its staff from the war-torn country .
The rebels , who temporarily ousted elected President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , are still engaged in a drive to stage a political comeback in the country , which was widely condemned in the world .
