FREE TRADE ZONE TIGHTENS RESTRICTIONS

COLON , Panama _ `` A den of pirates , '' one U.S. government official snorted when asked about the warren of shops , warehouses and banks just off the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal .
In recent books , spy novelist John Le Carre has portrayed the 1.5-square-mile walled compound as a steamy , seedy nest of intrigue where , for the right price and with the right contacts , just about anything goes .
That much isn n't fiction .
The free-trade zone here is the largest in the world outside Hong Kong , selling more than $ 6.2 billion in goods each year to customers from all over Latin America and the Caribbean .
But name a dubious commercial activity of interest to U.S. law-enforcement or intelligence agencies , and chances are someone has been caught doing it in Colon .
The laundering of drug money , the smuggling of arms to guerrilla and paramilitary groups in South and Central America , the sale of goods to Cuba in defiance of the U.S. economic embargo , the counterfeiting of trademarks _ all have traditionally been part of the local landscape , perhaps reaching a peak during the corrupt military dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega .
But now , as it prepares to celebrate its 50th Anniversary , the Colon Free Zone is trying to clean up its act .
With competing duty-free centers popping up all over the Western Hemisphere , it is scrambling to hold onto the business that for decades it all but owned .
Huge new ports have been built , rail lines upgraded , fees lowered and inefficiencies attacked .
And , to make sure the world takes the image change seriously , it has launched one of the harshest crackdowns on money laundering in the hemisphere .
`` We want to position ourselves for the 21st century as a huge distribution and transshipment center to all of Latin America , '' said Nessim Bassan , vice president of Fila Sportwear Corp. and a former president of the Colon Free Zone Users ' Association .
Established in June 1948 , the Colon Free Zone has enjoyed a virtual monopoly on free trade in Latin America for most of its existence because governments almost everywhere else imposed high tariffs on foreign goods to protect inefficient domestic industries .
For smugglers , this protectionism created a market of 450 million people stretching from Tijuana just south of the U.S. border to Tierra del Fuego at South America 's southernmost tip .
Merchants from Colombia , Peru , Ecuador , Haiti , Jamaica , the Dominican Republic and other nearby countries flocked here , knowing they could always find the electronic appliances , car parts , clothing , liquor , perfume and jewelry their customers wanted but could not obtain legally at home .
Asian manufacturers were especially quick to pour their goods into the free-zone pipeline ; today , Hong Kong , Japan , South Korea and Taiwan account for about 60 percent of the goods sold from here .
But in the global economy of the 1990s , many of the old protectionist barriers have fallen , a process that is expected to accelerate as a result of last month 's summit meeting of hemispheric heads of state in Santiago , Chile .
Spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement and other regional pacts , countries throughout Latin America are racing to open their markets , and rival free-trade zones have now emerged to challenge Colon 's hegemony at sites as far-flung as Miami , Manaus in Brazil , Iquique in Chile and Ciudad del Este , Paraguay .
`` They are going to have to reinvent themselves , '' said Victoria Figge , the Free Zone 's government-appointed chief administrator from 1994 to 1997 and now the head of the Panamanian government 's money-laundering monitoring unit .
`` The rules of the game worldwide are totally different now , and they have to adjust themselves to these new conditions and better exploit our privileged geographic position '' at the mouth of the Panama Canal .

Not everybody thinks they are up to the task .
Richard Wainio , the just-retired director of planning for the Panama Canal Commission , the U.S. government body charged with administering the waterway until its handover to Panama on Dec. 31 , 1999 , predicts that Colon 's role will shrink as world trade expands .
`` I 'm one of the doomsayers , '' Wainio said .
`` The zone is a huge operation , and it 's not going to disappear .
But the future lies in container transshipment , not warehousing .
As barriers come down and you have a free flow of goods , you don n't need that kind of operation conducted , legally or no , out of the zone . ''
Traders here , though , say they are adjusting to the new realities , and they point to a 15.6 percent increase in business last year as proof .
Even with the regional boom in free trade , they argue , it is both quicker and cheaper for merchants in nearby countries to rely on Colon as a distribution point than to deal directly with manufacturers in Asia or the United States .
`` We are a huge warehouse , '' with up to $ 1.5 billion in goods on hand at any time , said Nidal Waked , the current president of the users ' association that represents the zone 's more than 1,200 businesses .
`` We have everything here .
If you want to put together a container with a thousand different products , you can do it here , and we can get it to you in almost no time . ''
Foreign manufacturers also have reason to retain the Colon connection rather than to export directly to Latin American buyers , merchants here said .
`` We know what the Colombian , the Venezuelan , the Chilean likes because we have people who travel there every two weeks to visit clients , '' said Waked , whose family business , Vida Panama , sells refrigerators , washing machines , stoves and microwave ovens .
`` I suppose that the big brands could do that , but they would have to start from zero , and why do that when we are here and have 50 years of experience ? ''
In recent years , the zone 's growth was slowed by high fees , inefficiency , corruption and theft at the nearby port of Cristobal .
But that problem has been attacked by huge investments in projects to speed up the shipment of goods across the isthmus .
A pair of giant container terminals have recently opened here , two more are nearing completion , and a railway line across the isthmus is being renovated .
All these measures have ended Cristobal 's monopoly and slashed freight costs in half .
At the same time , Panamanian authorities have taken drastic action to make Colon less attractive to the drug cartels from Colombia and Mexico that have laundered billions of dollars here over the years .
Since 1996 , businesses here have been required to declare all transactions that exceed $ 10 , 000 , for instance , and can no longer accept traditional forms of payment like money orders , travelers checks , third-party transfers or checks drawn on Mexican banks .
Those rules _ which on paper are even tougher than those in the United States _ have not been especially popular among traders , who argue that they are losing business to other free zones , Miami in particular .
In any case , many of them have never acquired the habit of asking questions of their clients .
`` Where the money comes from , I can n't say , '' said Marcos Almed Meza , a salesman for Nemo Traders , a small merchant house that sells clothing and electronic appliances .
`` If a customer has made a declaration , then it 's not my problem . ''
Thus far , the efforts to clean up traditional financing practices have drawn mixed reviews .
While Panamanian officials tend to emphasize the progress that has been made , their U.S. counterparts take a more jaundiced view .
`` I think they want to wean themselves from this , but they don n't quite know how to do it yet , '' said a U.S. government official who specializes in money laundering .
`` Something has happened to open the dialogue , but I have to be very candid : This isn n't a honeymoon , and we are not going to be happy until the whole system is disabled . ''
`` They 've seen the erosion of their traditional franchises , tax evasion and smuggling and black marketeering , since they are not the sole source anymore , '' the official continued .
`` So they feel they have to start tightening up and not be tagged as a rogue money-laundering center . ''
Traders here have drawn the line , however , at helping the United States enforce its economic embargo against Cuba .
For decades , the Cuban government has come here to buy products it can not obtain from the United States _ from television sets and air conditioners for hotels to car parts and pharmaceuticals _ and is treated as a prized customer .
Panamanian businesses , Ms. Figge said , `` have the right to deal with whomever we want , as long as we do so according to our laws . ''
But `` if an American company uses the Free Zone to divert its products to Cuba , that 's a different matter , '' she added , one best resolved by American authorities .
`` What can we do under our laws to stop it ? ''
she asked .
Concerns about weapons deals also persist , especially in light of recent news reports of arms shipments to Croatia and to both paramilitary and guerrilla forces in neighboring Colombia that appear to have been channeled through the Free Zone .
But Giovanni Ferrari , vice president of Farmazona , a pharmaceutical concern , who is also a former president of the users association , dismissed such dealings as an aberration of the Noriega period .
`` You need a large degree of tolerance on the part of the government to do those operations , which is no longer the case in Panama , '' he said .
`` The cronies who operated with carte blanche in the Free Zone are not there anymore , so I would say there is very , very little of that .
In fact , I would even go so far as to say it may have been eradicated . ''
