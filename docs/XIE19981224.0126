MAPUTO , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Portugal has relieved Mozambique of about 105 million U.S. Dollars of debt from 1990 to 1998 , the Portuguese Embassy to Mozambique said here Thursday in a statement .
The statement said that along with the debt relief , the Portuguese government also re-arranged 451 million Dollars of debt Mozambique owes to Portugal by changing it from commercial loan to about 30-to-40 years low-interest loans .
The Portuguese government has relieved a total of 756 million Dollars of debts owed by foreign countries over the past eight years , of which Mozambique accounts for 75 percent of the total debt re-adjustment .
Guinea Bissau follows Mozambique as the second beneficiary of Portugal 's debt re-adjustment .
Mozambique , which currently has 5.6 billion Dollars of foreign debt , may expect to reduce its debt to about 1.1 billion Dollars by next June , because it was regarded this year as one of the highest indebted poor countries in the world .
