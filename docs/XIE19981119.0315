U.S. Supports Turkey on Extradition of Ocalan
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States on Wednesday expressed its support for Turkey 's request that Italy extradite Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan .
" We believe he should be extradited and brought to justice .
And we hope a way will be found to extradite him to Turkey , consistent with international and Italian law , " State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing .
The U.S. said it favored extradition and a trial for Ocalan , the leader of the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , but it did not take a position on where he should go .
Asked to explain the change , Rubin said that Turkey was the only country to send Italy an extradition request and that most of Ocalan 's alleged crimes took place on Turkish soil .
On reports that Ocalan has renounced " terrorism , " possibly as a defense against extradition to Turkey , the spokesman said , " We are deeply sceptical of this PKK leader 's repudiation of terrorism .
Given the number of times he has renounced violence in the past , on each previous occasion the PKK continued to engage in ruthless acts of terrorism . "
" We have no doubt that this man is a terrorist , and he therefore should receive no safe haven , " Rubin said .
