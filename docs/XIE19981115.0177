Jayasinghe Doping Affair not Ends , Top IAAF Official
BEIJING , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Top Sri Lankan athlete Susanthika Jayasinghe was still banned from competition by the International Amateur Athletic Federation ( IAAF ) after she failed a random drug test in April , a top official said in a letter released by the Chinese Athletic Association here on Sunday .
Istvan Gyulai , gerneral secretary of IAAF , said : " I confirm that the IAAF Doping Commission considered the question of the athlete 's reinstatement by the Athletic Federation of Sri Lanka .
The Commission does not agree to the reinstatement and will recommend to the IAAF Council to refer the case to arbitration . "
Gyulai added in the letter : " I will be able to provide more information on this matter after the Coucil meeting which will take place on 19 - 20 November 1998 . "
The letter was written by Gyulai on November 5 to Maurice Nicholas , Honorary Secretary-Treasurer of Asian Amateur Athletic Association ( AAAA ) .
Shang Xiutang , general secretary of the Chinese Athletic Assocition ( CAA ) , said on Sunday that CAA also received a copy of the letter from AAAA .
Shang claimed last Friday that Jayasinghe has little hope to run in the Asian Games to be held on December 6 - 20 in Bangkok , Thailand .
However , Jayasinghe , who shot to fame last year by winning the women 's 200 m silver medal at the World Athletic Championships in Athens , said earlier in Colombo she knew nothing of the latest threat to her career .
" I don n't know what this Chinese official is talking about .
I am fully cleared of any wrong doing and if the ban on me has not been lifted , then I should be the first to know , " the 23-year-old told world wire service Agency France Press ( AFP ) .
The Sri Lanka Athletics authorities said in August the suspension had been lifted by the IAAF , adding Jayasinghe had to undergo tests for banned steroids every three months .
Jayasinghe has made the Sri Lankan Asian Games squad after winning the 100 m and 200 m at the national athletic championships on November 1.
