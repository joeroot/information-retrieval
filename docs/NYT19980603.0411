STOCKS DECLINE AMID CONCERNS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY ISSUES
( bl ) By SHARON R. KING c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ Resilient concerns about weakness in the technology sector pushed stocks lower Wednesday , with the Nasdaq composite index falling more than 1 percent .
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 87.44 for the day .
The declines among technology shares contributed to a late-day selling spree that spread throughout the market .
It was exacerbated by a wave of computer-generated sell programs , which were responsible for chopping more than 93 points off the Dow .
Intel Corp. , the bellwether semiconductor issue , led the declines among technology issues .
It fell 3 5 / 16 , to 65 15 / 16 , its lowest level since April 1997 .
The stock came under pressure after a research analyst , Robert Chaplinsky of the Hambrecht & AMP ; Quist Group , lowered his second-quarter earnings estimate due to expectations of slowing sales abroad .
In addition , traders said , a rumor that Intel would warn that the April-June quarter earnings could disappoint _ coming in at 65 cents a share compared with the 70 cents widely forecast _ contributed to the decline .
Intel 's problems illustrated investors ' persistent concerns about the technology sector .
Worries about the impact of Asia 's financial crisis on earnings as well as dampening domestic consumer demand have pressured chipmakers , computer companies such as Dell Computer and software companies such as Hewlett-Packard .
Investors are worried that disappointing earnings from technology shares , which have been among the leaders of the current rally , could signal similar declines in other sectors , said Anthony Conroy , a managing director for Bankers Trust Global Investment Management in New York .
Such concerns have heightened investors ' unwillingness to buy stocks , cotinuing a recent trend in which early market gains evaporate into declines by the day 's end .
`` It 's still a kind of skittish market and there 's no real trend , '' said Charles W. Washington , head equity trader for Blaylock & AMP ; Partners in Baltimore .
`` The market is not capitalizing on the good news , '' said William E. Barker Jr. , chief investment strategist at Dain Rauscher .
He noted that recent planned merger deals such as Tellabs purchase of Ciena and American Home Products ' coupling with Monsanto have failed to excite investors and cause strong gains in those stocks .
The Dow , which traded higher briefly during the day , closed down 87.44 points , at 8 , 803.80 .
One sell program during the last 40 minutes of trading took 80 points off the blue-chip index , according to to Birinyi Associates , a Greenwich , Conn . - based research firm .
The Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 index fell 10.49 points and the Nasdaq plunged 19.48 points , to 1 , 761.79 , a 1.11 percent decline .
However , the long-term sentiment remains bullish with analysts like Goldman Sachs ' Abby Joseph Cohen forecasting that earnings growth will resume later in the year and propel stock prices higher .
Stocks are currently priced at fair value , Mrs. Cohen said in a recent market comment .
The current climate of low interest rates and attractive fundamentals , such as the federal budget surplus , well-managed corporations and solid financial institutions will be the catalysts to push prices higher , she said .
And investors like Barker and Alan Bond , chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management said they are ready to pick up stocks like Intel if their prices continue to fall .
`` Intel looks pretty cheap here , '' said Bond , who recently sold some shares of the stock at a price above $ 80 a share .
`` I would be a buyer on weakness , but I would make darn sure the company has visible earnings growth and a reasonable valuation , '' said Barker .
