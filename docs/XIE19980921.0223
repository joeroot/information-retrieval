NZ Foreign Ministry Reviews Costs of Overseas Posts
WELLINGTON , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is reviewing the costs of its overseas posts and domestic operation because of financial pressures .
" Driven by economic circumstances , " the ministry is conducting a review on the costs of its 48 embassies , high commissions and consulates and could be forced to close some of them , James Funnell , spokesman of the ministry , told Xinhua Monday .
The ministry employs about 200 New Zealand staff in overseas posts , which had a total budget of 116 million NZ dollars ( 59 million U.S. dollars ) in the last financial year .
The ministry is also looking into the costs of its operations in New Zealand , where it employs about 400 people .
Funnell said closing embassies is " one of the options , " but his ministry will do its best to " avoid doing so . "
He said closing embassies could damage bilateral relations .
" It sends a message to the host countries that we don n't consider them important enough to keep a post open .
The closing of embassies certainly means that the relationship could remain frosty for some years .
Even if we explain that it is being done for sensible economic reasons , they will still be upset . "
Referring to the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing and a consulate in Shanghai , Funnel said that in view of the political and economic relations between the two countries , the ministry is unlikely to consider closing them .
The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade regards them as " valuable posts , " which have done a lot of things in promoting bilateral relations in both political and economic fields , he said .
