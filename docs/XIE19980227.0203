China Removes Production Materials from State Planning
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- China removed rolled steel , timber and cement from the list of products under direct state planning in response to its recent achievements in establishing a market economy .
However , petroleum , natural gas , refined oil products , coal and automobiles remain under strict state control , according to the State Planning Commission .
Officials noted that alterations in the state plan allow Chinese enterprises to gage production of specified products in line with market supply and demand .
They pointed to China 's long-standing use of state planning to guide the production of strategic production materials subject in short supply .
However , the prevailing buyer 's market for most production materials has eliminated the need for state planning in many areas .
Various experts contend that China will abolish all state planning once the socialist market economy is fully operational .
