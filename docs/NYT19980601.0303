MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIAL LIKELY TO PLAY ROLE ON IRISH REFORMS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By KEVIN CULLEN c.1998 The Boston Globe
DUBLIN _ Kathleen M. O ' Toole , the Massachusetts secretary of public safety , is one of five people expected to be named this week to a commission that will recommend reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary , Northern Ireland 's police force .
The six-member commission , which was established under the accord that was overwhelmingly approved by voters in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic May 22 , will be chaired by Chris Patten , the last British governor of Hong Kong .
Restructuring of the force of almost 13,000 is considered essential to cementing the settlement and helping to end 30 years of sustained sectarian and political violence .
In a telephone interview Sunday night , O ' Toole said she had been nominated to the commission but had not received confirmation from British officials .
But sources close to the selection process in Belfast said that the Northern Ireland secretary of state , Mo Mowlam , will announce the appointment of O ' Toole and four other commission members , possibly as early as Monday .
Patten had been named chairman of the commission last month .
`` If I am appointed , I 'd be delighted and honored to serve , '' said O ' Toole , who announced last week she would leave her state Cabinet position this year to become director of the alumni association at her alma mater , Boston College .
`` There 's nowhere else in the world where the role of the police is more important right now , '' she said .
`` There is a huge opportunity in Northern Ireland , and I 'd be thrilled to be in a position to contribute . ''
O ' Toole , 44 , who would be the only American and one of two international figures on the panel , impressed law enforcement and government officials in Northern Ireland during three visits there as Massachusetts ' top law enforcement official .
As one of the highest-ranking female police administrators in the United States , O ' Toole caught the attention of Mowlam , who met O ' Toole two years ago in Boston when she was the British Labor Party 's shadow secretary for Northern Ireland .
O ' Toole is the first woman to serve as the state 's highest-ranking law enforcement official .
Mowlam is the first woman to serve as Britain 's top official in Northern Ireland .
O ' Toole most recently visited Northern Ireland last fall , when she led a Massachusetts delegation that advised officials in Belfast how to establish a program to combat domestic violence .
They used the program at Quincy District Court as a model .
The Royal Ulster Constabulary , or RUC , is 93 percent Protestant , and the biggest challenge facing administrators is how to downsize a force that was just 3,000 when violence erupted in 1968 while also increasing Catholic representation on , and confidence in , the force .
In no other area is the yawning gap of perception and life experience between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists in Northern Ireland more evident than in attitudes toward the RUC .
Protestants strongly support the RUC and are deeply suspicious of attempts to reform it .
Many Catholics have had negative experiences with the RUC .
Some want it disbanded .
Those who think disbanding the force is unrealistic want it reformed and its ranks to more closely reflect the 43 percent of the population that is Catholic .
The pact of April 10 , known as the Good Friday accord , acknowledges the need to change the RUC and establishes an independent commission to recommend how to `` ensure that policing arrangements , including composition , recruitment , training , culture , ethos and symbols , are such that in a new approach , Northern Ireland has a police service that can enjoy widespread support from , and is seen as an integral part of , the community as a whole . ''
In her Cabinet position , O ' Toole oversaw several state agencies , including the State Police , the Department of Correction , and the Registry of Motor Vehicles .
O ' Toole has a reputation for promoting technological innovation and new management approaches in law enforcement .
She pushed police departments throughout Massachusetts to adopt community policing methods , and the state 's crime rate dropped during her tenure .
`` I 'd like to think I was considered for this commission because of the work I 've done on community policing , '' said O ' Toole .
In an interview with the Globe last month , Ronnie Flanagan , the RUC chief , said he appreciated O ' Toole 's efforts , especially last year 's presentation on domestic violence .
Flanagan is friendly with O ' Toole 's mentor , William Bratton , who served as police commissioner in Boston and New York .
Still , O ' Toole 's background as a Catholic Irish-American from South Boston will cause some skepticism among Protestants who are wary of changes to the RUC .
As an American and as a Catholic , O ' Toole 's presence on the commission will please Irish nationalists .
But her credentials as a police officer and administrator and her previous willingness to work with the RUC may comfort Protestants who oppose attempts to reform it .
Last night , O ' Toole said her nomination was based on `` my experience as a professional police officer and administrator .
I intend to talk about policing issues , not politics . ''
Sources close to the selection process said the other proposed panelists include Maurice Hayes , the former Northern Ireland ombudsman ; Lucy Woods , the chief of British Telecom in Northern Ireland ; Clifford Sheering , a South African criminologist at the University of Toronto ; and John Smith , former deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London .
Hayes is known in Boston by his association with the Boston-based American Ireland Fund , the largest Irish-American charity in the United States .
Last year , Hayes wrote a report recommending changes in the way complaints against police in Northern Ireland are handled .
Although she has been secretary of public safety for the last four years , O ' Toole still holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Massachusetts State Police .
A police officer for 19 years , she has also served with the Metropolitan Police before it merged with the State Police .
