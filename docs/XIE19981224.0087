Scientists Concerned About Fate of Finless Black Porpoise
HEFEI , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's finless black porpoise is in urgent need of protection , according to a group of scientists who have done research on the white-flag dolphins and finless black porpoise .
The research covered five provinces and one municipality along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River , and confirmed the existence of 1,465 finless black porpoises .
Scientists say that a large bridge built on Poyang Lake , China 's largest fresh-water lake , disturbed the normal patterns of the porpoise and kept them from entering the lake .
They have asked government departments to improve the ecology on the middle and lower reaches of the river to protect the animal from extinction .
