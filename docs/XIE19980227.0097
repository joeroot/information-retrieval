S. Africa , Mozambique , Swaziland to Jointly Fight
JOHANNESBURG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- A joint project has been launched with the support of the Mozambican , Swazi and South African governments to contain malaria and encourage economic development in the border areas between the three countries .
According to the South African Press Association Friday , Manager of the project , Andrew Zaloumis , said the initiative aims to contain malaria in the region and therefore create a suitable climate for the establishment of vibrant tourism and agricultural industries in South Africa 's northern Kwazulu-Natal , eastern Swaziland and southern Mozambique .
Recent research shows that the high rate of malaria in these regions is one of the major causes of continued under-development and poverty , he said .
The project 's malaria intervention program involves increased service at the primary health-care level , the spraying of homes and mosquito-breeding areas with environmentally sound insecticide and using geographic information to generate data about malaria hot spots in the region .
Successful malaria control programs are in place in both Swaziland and South Africa .
These activities would now be replicated in Mozambique , Zaloumis said .
In Kwazulu-Natal , each malaria-affected magisterial district has been divided into approximately 20 malaria control areas , which were again sub-divided into 10 sections .
Each house within a section was numbered and given a green card bearing the findings of surveillance personnel and when the house was sprayed with insecticide .
