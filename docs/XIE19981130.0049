Deutsche Bank to Take Over Bankers Trust Next Spring
BONN , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Deutsche Bank Chairman Rolf Breuer said Monday that he expected the 10 billion U.S. dollar takeover of the Bankers Trust Corp. to be completed by the spring of 1999 .
Under the deal approved by the directors of Deutsche Bank and the Bankers Trust Sunday , Deutsche Bank will buy the latter 's stocks at a price of 93 dollars for each share .
The takeover is expected to create the world 's largest financial service company with assets of some 850 billion dollars and 96,000 employees .
Breuer said at a Frankfurt press conference that the deal could also save some 1 billion dollars for the two banks , which would come mainly from reduced personnel and data processing costs .
The Deutsche Bank chief executive dismissed worries about possible culture conflicts between the two banks , one German and the other American .
" If one were relationship-oriented and the other transaction - oriented , there might be culture clashes , " he said , confirming his belief that the merger would proceed smoothly .
Breuer admitted that there would be job losses , perhaps amounting to around 5,500 worldwide .
But he said most of the job losses would be in New York and London .
If the merger finishes in the spring of 1999 , the actual launching date for the financial giant would be September 30 , 1999 .
The acquisition , if successful , will be the largest foreign takeover of a U.S. financial company .
The Bankers Trust is the eighth-largest U.S. bank .
