Four European Satellite Makers to Merge
PARIS , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Four European groups which produce satellites , the GEC of Britain , the Lagardere of France , DASA of Germany and Alenia of Italy , signed an agreement on allying their satellite making activities on Wednesday .
The merger will create an 18 billion franc ( 3.1 billion U.S. dollars ) group , which will be Europe 's largest and the world 's third largest in satellite industry .
The signing of the agreement , which was announced in October , was delayed by hesitation of GEC over the strategy of the alliance in the past several weeks .
GEC holds 49 percent of the stocks of Matra Haute Technologies company , which is under the Matra Marconi Space ( MMC ) of the Lagardere group .
The MMC had negotiated with DASA , which is owned by Daimler-Chrysler , and Alenia , which is affiliate to the Italian public group Finmeccanica , on a rapprochement of their space industry activities .
The four groups said in a common communique that the merger will be carried out in 1999 when a final agreement will be signed and the European Union will give its approval to the merger .
The agreement signed on Wednesday covers the conditions and terms for the merger under the reservation of future approval on social terms and corresponding rules for the future group .
