Hong Kong , Singapore Join Force to Combat Drug Abuse
HONG KONG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Hong Kong and Singapore have further strengthened their liaison and cooperation in combating drug abuse and trafficking .
Hong Kong 's Commissioner for Narcotics Clarie Lo has been appointed to the Singapore National Council Against Drug Abuse ( NCADA ) , an advisory body on anti-drug matters , a Hong Kong government release said Friday .
When she left for Singapore Friday to attend the NCADA 's regular meeting , Lo said : " Such exchange of experience and views will certainly bring further benefits to Hong Kong in our efforts to combat drug abuse and trafficking . "
Last August , Deputy Director of Singapore 's Central Narcotics Bureau Tan Seck Kang was appointed to Hong Kong 's Action Committee Against Narcotics ( ACAN ) , which plays a similar role as the NCANA does .
The two governments agreed last year to make such arrangement for the common objective of fighting against drugs .
