World Bank Report on Economic Situation in South Asia
KATHMANDU , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Despite the financial turmoil in neighboring East Asia , most of the South Asian countries continued to record satisfactory gross domestic product ( GDP ) and export growth in 1997 , said the World Bank Annual Report 1998 available here Wednesday .
" Foreign investment in the region continued to grow , with net long-term resource flows reaching the highest level on record , " the report said .
At 5.2 percent in 1997 , South Asia 's GDP growth was down almost one percent from 1996 , mainly due to sluggish demand and stagnation in India 's industrial sector and low cotton output in Pakistan .
The report said that estimated growth rates in fiscal 1998 are 5.5 percent in Bangladesh , 5.1 percent in India , 5.4 percent in Pakistan and 5.8 percent in Sri Lanka .
It noted that the fiscal deficit in India rose to an estimated 6.1 percent of GDP from fiscal 1997's deficit of 4.9 percent despite continued efforts by the government to reduce spending .
Estimates indicate that Bangladesh 's fiscal deficit remained unchanged from fiscal 1997 at 5.3 percent of GDP , Pakistan 's fell to 5.4 percent from 6.3 percent while Sri Lanka 's to 6.5 percent from 7.6 percent , the report said .
Largely due to increased disbursements from official creditors , the region 's long-term external debt rose by three percent , reaching 142 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 , the report noted , adding that official debt continued to account for the bulk of the region 's long-term liabilities .
A nine percent rise in export revenues led to an improvement in the debt-to-export ratio , which fell from 194 percent in 1996 to 183 percent in 1997 , but it still exceeds the average for all developing countries ( 136 percent in 1997 ) , the report said .
Meanwhile , short-term external debt remained low , a factor that may have helped prevent slipover from the East Asian financial crisis .
" Financial sector regulations , which prohibited banks from fueling large credit booms , and small current account deficits also helped the region avoid financial crisis , " the report observed .
However , " uncertainty about the economic prospects of the region increased , following the detonation of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan in May 1998 and the resulting imposition of economic sanctions by several industrial countries , " it said .
The report said that growth in private capital flows leveled off in 1997 after jumping from an average of 5 billion dollars between 1990 - 95 to 9 billion dollars in 1996 with India continuing to attract the bulk .
