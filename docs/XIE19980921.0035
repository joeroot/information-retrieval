CAIRO -- Libya on Sunday criticized a Dutch-British proposal of holding the trial of two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing at a military camp in the Netherlands .
In a statement carried by Libya 's JANA news agency , the Foreign Ministry also demanded an agreement of all sides involved in the matter , including the defendants ' lawyers , on the trial site .
