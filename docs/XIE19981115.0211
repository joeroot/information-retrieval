U.S. NASA Refuses Russian Proposal on Space Station
WASHINGTON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. NASA refused Russian Space Agency 's Proposal to launch the international space station closer to Russia 's Mir , the New York Times reported Saturday .
Speaking at a press conference held Friday at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Randy Brinkley , NASA 's space station program manager , said that while putting the new station closer to Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one , but the request came too late to be acted on .
The Russian side proposed last week to change the position of the space station just two-and-half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station .
Delaying the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in the subsequent assembly flights , and would result in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the solar-powered station .
However NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir 's research equipment to use on the international space station , said Brinkley , but only if it does not interfere with assembling the new station .
The 16-member nations plan to begin assembly the long-awaited international space station next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period .
U.S. space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second station part , an American-built connecting passageway that attaches to the first module .
