RED WINGS SHOOT DOWN STARS , 5 - 3
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By MIKE HEIKA c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
DETROIT _ The Stars decided to take an aggressive game to the Joe Louis Arena ice last night and make the Detroit Red Wings react .
The Wings did , to the tune of four goals on the first 11 shots while riding to a 5 - 3 victory in Game 3 of what was supposed to be a defensive-minded Western Conference finals .
The victory gives the Red Wings a 2 - 1 lead in the best-of-seven series heading into tomorrow 's 1 p.m. rematch at Joe Louis Arena _ a place in which the Stars are 1 - 15-2 in their past 18 games .
It also could have the Stars in a sort of identity crisis .
While the team has pitched strong defensive play throughout the playoffs , they decided to gamble yesterday and force the issue .
While that resulted in numerous offensive chances and a 34 - 20 edge in shots , it also allowed the Red Wings to sneak through the little cracks .
`` I think we can play aggressively , we just can n't make the mistakes we made , '' defenseman Darryl Sydor said .
`` We made a few mistakes and they took advantage . ''
After the Stars closed to within 4 - 3 in the third period , a Detroit goal with 4 : 05 remaining ended comeback hopes .
The Stars played firehouse hockey from the opening drop , pushing the play at Detroit and trying to prove they weren n't intimidated by either the crowd or the Red Wings .
That resulted in a harried first 10 minutes for Red Wings goalie Chris Osgood , but the Stars paid the price at the other end .
The Red Wings came up with three outmanned rushes in which the Stars defensemen were excellent in keeping the pressure off goalie Ed Belfour .
On the fourth Wings ' rush , however , Belfour wasn n't so lucky .
Steve Yzerman took advantage of a neutral zone turnover and made a perfect move to center ice to open up about five feet of space for linemate Brent Gilchrist .
With Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig closing in front and Stars center Benoit Hogue trailing behind , Gilchrist was able to slip a wrist shot over Belfour for a 1 - 0 lead at the 5 : 50 mark of the first period .
`` We can play aggressive , we just can n't make those mistakes , '' center Guy Carbonneau said .
The Stars seemed to have control of the game , despite the 1 - 0 deficit and had a golden opportunity to tie the score when Wings defenseman Larry Murphy took his first penalty of the playoffs to give the Stars a five-on-three power play for 1 minute , 34 seconds .
But while the Stars peppered Osgood with five shots , they couldn n't score on a power play that is 0-for-22 in three games against the Red Wings and has just two goals in its past 11 playoff games .
`` We sure could have used a goal then , '' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said .
`` Our power play took some energy away from our game . ''
The crowd at The Joe was never any louder in the game than it was after the Wings killed the five-on-three , and it was just three minutes later that the Red Wings scored on their own power play to take a 2 - 0 lead .
That play truly was a bad break ; a Nicklas Lidstrom shot from the point deflected off the skate of Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher and slithered past Belfour .
The Stars had controlled much of the play to that point , and still found themselves behind .
And it would only get worse .
Lidstrom sneaked another point shot past Belfour in the second period , followed by a long shot from the stick of defenseman Jamie Macoun to give the Wings a 4 - 0 lead just 25 : 33 into the game .
Belfour had faced 11 shots and was not looking like the man who had not allowed more than two goals in the previous 10 games _ an NHL record .
That 's when the Stars pulled out all of the stops .
Hitchcock made several moves , most notably reuniting the top scoring line of Mike Modano , Jere Lehtinen and Jamie Langenbrunner .
Lehtinen responded with two goals and an assist , while Modano had a goal and an assist and Langenbrunner an assist .
With 12 : 26 remaining in the game , the Stars closed to within 4 - 3 and had a real chance of tying .
Again , however , there were mistakes .
The Stars failed once again on the power play , sucking more air out of their game .
And then Belfour strayed from his net while trying to play the puck and was knocked down by the Red Wings ' Martin Lapointe .
That allowed Lapointe to find an open spot and put in the insurance goal with 4 : 05 remaining to play .
Hitchcock said afterward the comeback was indicative of the way the team played , adding that `` from a five-on-five standpoint , that 's the best we 've played all playoffs . ''
But while the Stars were happy with the comeback , they didn n't share Hitchcock 's glow .
`` We can slap each other on the back ( for coming back ) , but we 're not fooling anyone , '' center Brian Skrudland said .
Defenseman Craig Ludwig said changes are in order for Game 4.
`` We 've got to play a lot smarter than that , '' he said .
`` Our style is not to give up the outmanned rushes .
There has to be a right time to jump into the play and when not to .
We 've got guys who want to win bad , but we have to do it with control . ''
