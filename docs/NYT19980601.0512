The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday , June 2 :
New Yorkers who take perverse pride in complaining about the state 's dreadful political process must be humbled by Tuesday 's California primary .
Gov. George Pataki 's $ 12 million campaign chest looks like bus fare compared with the money that has already been spent there , just on the race for a gubernatorial nomination .
The three Democratic contenders together have forked over about $ 60 million .
In company like this , even Sen. Alfonse D ' Amato could end up looking impoverished .
California is supposed to be the promised land for rich candidates with nothing on their resumes except TV ad buys .
But lately the old political fixtures have begun to look more attractive , and polls showed voters poised for a flight to the familiar .
Al Checchi , the businessman who invested an estimated $ 40 million in the governor 's race , found the going harder than he expected .
Californians began paying more attention to Lt. Gov. Gray Davis , a Sacramento veteran who boasted he was `` the best-trained governor-in-waiting '' ever .
Five years ago that might have sounded depressing .
But economic boom times tend to change people 's perspective on continuity .
By last weekend , California 's much-discussed `` virtual '' campaign of soulless TV commercials had returned to the retail politics of sidewalk press conferences and handshaking .
The multimillionaire Checchi orated like a populist assemblyman , and the sedate Davis told a church group that his wife had led him back to God .
While it makes for rather dull politics , predictability can produce good outcomes .
For instance , voters ' aversion to the dramatic gesture showed up earlier this spring in Nebraska to good effect .
Rep. John Christensen , the favorite in a Republican gubernatorial primary , frightened the public with his divisive rhetoric about homosexuals and nudity on public-access TV .
The voters fled into the camp of Mayor Mike Johans of Lincoln , who is as button-down as Christensen is hot-button , and won their hearts just by sounding sensible .
Special-interest groups seem to have lost their knack for swaying elections with a barrage of TV and radio ads .
In Pennsylvania , term-limit advocates poured money into an attempt to unseat the House education chairman , Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania .
The Republican voters responded by giving Goodling a 2-to-1 victory over his opponent .
Either the campaign finance scandals have turned the public off to these sorts of appeals , or listeners have simply gone deaf .
Jaded couch potatoes can just as easily click past a political commercial as they can ads for automobiles and diet cola .
