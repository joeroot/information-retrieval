` GODZILLA ' STILL TOPS , BUT HUGE TAIL IS DRAGGING
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By DAVE McNARY c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES _ The monster lizard again failed to deliver monster ticket sales as the second weekend of `` Godzilla '' took in an estimated $ 18 million at 3,310 theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period , studio sources said Sunday .
The total gave Sony 's much-hyped extravaganza $ 99.3 million after 13 days _ an impressive total for most films but a disappointment for one featuring the largest promotional campaign ever with promises that `` Godzilla '' would become a must-see blockbuster .
Business for `` Godzilla '' had been expected to fall quickly but its 59 percent decline from its opening Friday-Sunday was significantly steeper than last year 's 53 percent fall for `` The Lost World : Jurassic Park '' during the same weekend .
Steven Spielberg 's dino-sequel eventually took in $ 229 million domestically while `` Godzilla 's '' final U.S. gross is likely to come in around $ 150 million , half what many forecasters expected before the opening .
`` The ` Godzilla ' results are very soft for the second weekend and it looks like there 's no repeat business , '' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica .
`` Many people who saw it are disappointed because it doesn n't deliver the goods . ''
Rockwell , a former studio executive , said Sony may have erred by pushing `` Godzilla '' too aggressively .
`` What they needed was to create a campaign that made you want to see the film , not one with the message that you must see it , '' he said .
Overall business was ahead of the same weekend last year as rival releases posted relatively strong numbers , led by 20th Century Fox 's opening of Sandra Bullock 's `` Hope Floats '' with $ 14.7 million at 2,367 theaters .
The total for the romance was well ahead of expectations , which had been held down by the prospect of `` Godzilla '' dominating the market .
`` Godzilla 's '' performance was also hampered by solid competition from Paramount 's fourth weekend of `` Deep Impact '' with $ 10.1 million at 3,280 theaters , boosting its 24-day take to $ 112 million , and Disney 's third weekend of `` The Horse Whisperer '' with $ 7.3 million at 2,189 sites .
`` ` Hope Floats ' obviously had a big appeal to females and ` Deep Impact ' and ` The Horse Whisperer ' are perceived as quality films and are continuing to draw very good business , '' Rockwell said .
Warren Beatty 's `` Bulworth '' finished fifth with a moderate $ 5 million at 2,051 sites in its second weekend of nationwide release by 20th Century Fox .
The film 's performance has been lukewarm despite reviews that were stronger than `` Wag the Dog '' and `` Primary Colors , '' underscoring the difficulty in marketing the political genre .
Miramax 's `` I Got the Hook-Up , '' starring rapper Master P in a comedy about phone scams , opened respectably in sixth with $ 3.4 million at 655 theaters , followed by Warner Bros. ' debut of the late Chris Farley 's last film , `` Almost Heroes , '' with a disappointing $ 2.8 million at 2,048 theaters .
Expectations had been fairly limited for the latter , in which Farley played an explorer out to beat Lewis and Clark .
Warner 's third weekend of `` The Quest for Camelot '' finished eighth with $ 2.3 million at 2,449 theaters , followed by Paramount 's 24th weekend of `` Titanic '' with $ 1.73 million at 1,562 theaters .
The epic has topped $ 579 million after 164 days and leads `` Star Wars '' as the best domestic grosser by $ 118 million .
`` Titanic '' edged Universal 's second weekend of `` Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas '' with a downbeat $ 1.6 million at 1,130 locations .
Gramercy 's limited opening of `` The Last Days of Disco '' performed well with $ 275,000 at 22 theaters .
The romantic comedy will be expanded in coming weeks .
`` Godzilla 's '' reign as king of the box office will likely end next weekend as Paramount opens `` The Truman Show , '' an offbeat Jim Carrey comedy already drawing rave reviews .
