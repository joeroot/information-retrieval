India , Sri Lanka Sign Free Trade Pact
NEW DELHI , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- India and Sri Lanka Monday evening signed a free trade pact for enhancing bilateral trade relations .
Visiting Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee signed the agreement after they gave instructions to respective officials to overcome last-minute differences on the issue .
The new pact , the first of its kind in South Asian countries , provides for three-year phase-out of all tariffs by India and removal of tariffs by Sri Lanka over an eight-year period .
It will come into effect from March 1 next year .
It envisages annual review and safeguards , including a negative list , to ensure minimum 35 percent value-addition of imports to prevent third country products flooding markets in either country .
The loss in revenue as a result of tariff reduction would be made up by additional excise accruals through increased exports .
The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding for establishment of India-Sri Lanka foundation to promote interaction in the fields of art , culture , trade and science and technology .
