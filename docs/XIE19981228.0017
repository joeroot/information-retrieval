Iraq Urges Arab Political Parties to Condemn
BAGHDAD , December 27 , ( Xinhua ) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Sunday called upon Arab political parties to condemn the recent U.S . - British air strikes against Iraq .
In letters sent to heads of Arab political parties , Aziz , also head of the ruling Baath Party 's Foreign Relations Bureau , urged them to condemn the U.S . - British air strikes which started on October 16 as a criminal , illegitimate and unjustified aggression on a member state of the Arab League .
Aziz said the U.S. imposed all aggressive resolutions on Iraq under the cover of international legitimacy with the assistance of Britain .
Most countries in the world yield to America 's will because of international power imbalance , and Arab countries just accept these resolutions due to their split , he said .
Aziz stressed that despite the aggressive nature of those resolutions , Iraq cooperated with the U.N. Security Council and implemented these resolutions with a hope that the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 would be lifted after it implemented those resolutions .
He said since April 1991 until the latest U.S . - British aggression , Iraq has destroyed all the banned weapons , all factories , establishments , equipment and apparatuses that U.N. arms inspectors asked Iraq to destroy .
U.N. arms inspectors inspected thousands of sites all over Iraq including factories , Ministry of Defense , Republican Guards units , security systems , civil and military intelligence , ministries , universities and scientific institutes , citizens ' houses and farms , Aziz said .
He added that arms monitoring systems were set up on 588 sites in which cameras and surveillance systems were put up , and more than 120 inspectors work in these systems .
Aziz noted that despite all the above-mentioned work , the U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) did not declare that its mission was over .
The U.S. and Britain not only impose no-fly zones in the south and north of Iraq , but also call for overthrowing Iraq 's national regime with wicked Zionist plans to divide Iraq , he said .
Aziz called for further Arab support for lifting the eight-year-old economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
