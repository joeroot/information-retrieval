Bullish Jordan Has the Final Say c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle
CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan tried so hard not to call it a `` guarantee '' or a `` promise . ''
Whatever term he wanted to use for his prediction _ `` We 're going to win Game 7 , '' he had said two nights earlier _ he backed it up .
Not with one of his vintage scoring outbursts , but with alert passing , timely rebounding and a complete handcuffing of his nemesis and the Indiana Pacers ' sometimes-hero , Reggie Miller .
Jordan did all that , and because he did , the gimping , geezing Chicago Bulls are still defending their NBA championship .
The Bulls on Sunday night won the seventh and deciding game of the Eastern Conference finals 88 - 83 , and finally moved on to play the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals that open in Salt Lake City on Wednesday .
The Bulls , faced with playoff elimination for one of the very few times since they began their string of titles in 1991 , needed every jumper , every loose ball , every defensive stop and every whistle in their favor to hold off the Pacers before an alternately tense and raucous United Center crowd .
But most of all , they needed Jordan , who had only played in one Game 7 during the championship years ( in 1992 , when the Bulls defeated New York in the second round ) .
He delivered with 28 points , nine rebounds and eight assists , and kept Miller scoreless in the fourth quarter .
Jordan shot & LR ; ju & LR ; 9-for-25 from the floor and 10-for-15 from the line , but he also grabbed two crucial rebounds in the final two minutes .
The first was after Scottie Pippen missed a free throw after a basket that gave the Bulls an 87 - 83 lead , and the second came with 17 seconds left and the score the same , after the Pacers ' Derrick McKey missed a desperate 3-pointer .
Thus , Jordan did not have to eat his words , spoken Friday night after his stumble while driving for a potential game-tying basket sealed the Pacers ' Game 6 win in Indianapolis .
`` You have to think positive .
You can n't come into a game and put yourself into a position where you 're going to have negative thoughts , '' Jordan said afterward .
`` That 's why I had to say , as a leader , that we were going to win . ''
Had the Bulls lost , their quest for a sixth championship , and a third in a row , would have ended .
So , most likely , would Jordan 's career , as well as the tenures of Pippen , Dennis Rodman and coach Phil Jackson , in the management-mandated breakup that has been hinted at all season .
But , Jordan said , `` At no point in time , during the course of the 48 minutes , did I think negatively .
.
.
I never thought anything negative about what we could accomplish as a team . ''
His teammates chipped in just enough .
Toni Kukoc made up for his serious defensive deficiencies by scoring 21 points , 14 in the third quarter .
Steve Kerr knocked down three 3-pointers , two in the second quarter , to help the Bulls overcome the Pacers ' early 20 - 7 lead .
Pippen shot 6-for-18 but grabbed 12 rebounds and hit two huge baskets in the fourth to finish with 17 points .
Even with Dennis Rodman limited by fouls to six rebounds , the Bulls crushed the Pacers on the glass 50 - 34 , 22 - 4 on the offensive rebounds .
Miller 's 22 points through three quarters were not nearly enough , and his teammates didn n't make up the difference .
Travis Best , one of Game 6's heroes , was invisible with four points and one assist .
Dale Davis missed seven of 10 free throws .
Rik Smits played only 28 minutes because of foul trouble and managed just 13 points .
Unlike Game 6 , McKey was unable to contain Jordan down the stretch .
It was a disappointing finish for the Pacers , who lost a seventh game of the East finals on the road for the third time in five years .
`` It 's pretty bad in there , '' said Mark Jackson , nodding toward the locker room .
`` We knew we were the better team . ''
It was a sloppy game on both sides : the two teams combined to miss 33 of 78 free throws , and the Bulls ' 38 percent shooting was negated by the Pacers ' 13 turnovers , five in the final period .
Jordan made the difference , in a performance so complete , it reminded Pacers coach Larry Bird of himself .
`` That 's why he 's the best player in the league , and why he 's probably the best player ever , '' said a downcast Bird , who came up one win short of leading the Pacers to their first NBA Finals in his first year as a coach .
`` If I was having a bad shooting day ( as a player ) , I always tried to pass and I always tried to rebound .
And Michael 's the same way . ''
Even with the Bulls getting a little bit from everybody , the Pacers still led 72 - 69 with 8 : 54 to go , and they were up 79 - 77 with 5 : 47 to go .
But they managed only one basket the rest of the way , and in one gruesome stretch of four possessions they turned the ball over three times .
`` We did get the effort but we got beat to a lot of loose balls , a lot of rebounds slipped out of our hands _ a lot of little things beat us , '' Bird said .
Many of the little things were provided by Jordan , the biggest star on the court .
Because of that , Phil Jackson pointed out , `` We 've got another series , a new life . ''
