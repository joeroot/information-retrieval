DHAKA , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- The Bangladeshi government will soon formulate a policy for proper land use in the country , The Financial Express daily newspaper reported Monday .
This was disclosed by Agricultural Secretary A.M.M .
Shawkat Ali at a national workshop on " Land Use and Land Degradation Situation in Bangladesh " held in Dhaka Sunday .
The proposed policy would incorporate modalities of the optimum land use , he said , underpinning the need for proper use , planning and management in view of increasing pressure on land .
Low productivity in agriculture was not only due to degradation but also due to other factors like agro-economy and the present state of lack of harmonious balance in land distribution , he pointed out while dwelling on the relation between land use in agriculture and industry .
Land for housing , industry and infrastructure in Bangladesh are now experiencing conflicting use , he noted , calling upon the experts to find ways and means to strike a balance between agriculture and infrastructure for ensuring proper land management in the country .
The agricultural secretary , however , did not mentioned the exact time for formulating the policy .
