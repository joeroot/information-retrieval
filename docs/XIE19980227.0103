Another Upsurge of Lei Feng Enthusiasm
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The largest exhibition ever on the theme of the altruistic hero Lei Feng opened here today .
This is part of China 's third large-scale drive to educate people in the ideals of the humble soldier who dedicated himself to serving society .
" The spirit of Lei Feng reflects traditional Chinese virtues , " Qiao Anshan , who was an army comrade of Lei Feng , told visitors to the exhibition in the Museum of the Chinese Revolution .
In 1963 Chairman Mao Zedong wrote an inscription which read , " Learn From Comrade Lei Feng " .
At the same time he called on all the Chinese people to emulate Lei 's altruism and stoicism .
In 1986 senior leader Deng Xiaoping also referred to Lei when advocating the need for ethical and cultural progress .
Lei , who was born into a poor family in central China 's Hunan Province , always sacrificed his own interests in order to help other people , including his comrades , neighbors and even complete strangers .
The stumpy young man , whose name became a household word , lost his life in an accident at the age of 22 .
Almost everyone in China during the 1960s and 1970s knew the words of a song eulogizing him .
Qiao emerged into the limelight after the success of a film called " Days without Lei Feng " , which also featured himself .
" As social and economic progress brings us more and more material goods , " Qiao said , " We need the sincerity , kindness and unselfishness of Lei Feng more and more . "
Although they live some 30 years after Lei Feng died , Li Yan and her classmates from Beijing 's Yucai Primary School , who visited the exhibition on the inaugural day , claimed that they are familiar with stories about Lei .
The 12-year-old Li said that she is a member of a voluntary group set up to learn from Lei Feng at her school .
The exhibition has on display some of the hero 's personal articles , such as a pair of shabby socks , which Lei Feng darned over and over again .
There is also a notebook containing his attempt to write a novel .
Many enterprises and businesses have contacted the organizers to arrange group visits .
Furthermore , at least six foreign news organizations sent reporters to today 's exhibition .
