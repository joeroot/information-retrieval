NBA Commissioner Sets Lockout Deadline
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- NBA commissioner David Stern will recommend canceling the 1998 - 99 season if no agreement is reached before January 7 , according to a press report here today .
That means NBA owners and players have just two weeks left to save their season .
It is also the " drop-dead date " issued by the league following six month-long lockout .
It would be the first time that a major professional sports league in North America lost an entire season of competition for any reason .
Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the labor relations committee would make a report to the Board of Governors of NBA on January 7.
" If we do not have a collective bargaining agreement by that date , then David and I will have to recommend to the board that the 1998 - 99 season be canceled , " Granik said .
There was no immediate reaction from the National Basketball Players Association .
" It 's my view that if the owners are unwilling to move from their current proposal , the season will then be canceled , " agent Arn Tellem said .
" I believe that ultimately when the players analyze this , there is no way they will ever take the deal on the table . "
