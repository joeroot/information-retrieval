GOLDWATER FUNERAL GATE-CRASHERS FROM HELL
( For use by N.Y .
Times News Service clients ) By E.J .
MONTINI c.1998 The Arizona Republic
( Undated ) - If the Rev. Fred Phelps is correct _ and by God he believes he is _ then former Sen. Barry Goldwater is now a resident of hell .
Along with Frank Sinatra , Sonny Bono , Princess Diana and , possibly , Mother Teresa .
In order to reinforce this belief , Rev. Phelps is sending a squad
of holy warriors to picket Goldwater 's funeral Wednesday .
They plan to carry signs reading `` Barry in hell '' and worse .
This is necessary , the reverend told me Monday , because Goldwater was `` a supporter of Sodomites . ''
He explained , `` When you want to say it 's OK to be gay , then you 're saying God is a liar and the Bible is not a reliable guide .
You 're saying it 's OK to sin , because if the Bible is wrong on that weighty matter , then it 's not reliable on any matter . ''
R ev .
Phelps is reliable , however .
You can rely on him and his parading zealots from Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka , Kan. , to have something to say , to stage some protest , to try to get on TV , after the death of any person with a big name .
`` I 've been preaching the gospel for 50 years , '' Rev. Phelps said .
`` I 'm telling you , looking at the Bible , I have a profound feeling of distress that it 's too late for everyone in this country . ''
And he 's correct .
At least , it 's
too late for us to ignore Rev. Phelps .
He 's already been featured on local talk radio .
Already been in the local papers .
Soon , his sign-carrying zombies will turn up on local TV .
We live in the land of fruits and nuts .
Show th e media a fruit , and we go nuts .
Pastor Phelps is a Carmen Miranda , with a Bible .
After Sinatra died , the reverend sent out a press release that read in part , `` This whoremongering son of an abortionist became Chairman of the Board of the entertainment industry for half a century .
He must now atone for his sins . ''
Sonny Bono is in hell , Phelps says , for not condemning his gay daughter , Chastity .
After the death of Princess Diana , Westboro Baptist Church issued a s tatement reading , `` God Almighty has again manifested His hot displeasure against the prevailing depravity of these last days by dramatically snuffing out the hedonistic life of a leading international symbol of immoral , god-defying decadence . ''
I asked the reverend , `` Is there any prominent person in the United States who isn n't going to hell ? ''
`` No , '' he said .
`` I tell you , I get very lonely . ''
Phelps is very fond of Zimbabwe , though , and its President Robert Mugabe .
`` God bless Mugabe , '' he says .
`` Of all the leaders of the modern states , he is the only one taking the proper position on the homosexual menace . ''
Because of this , the Westboro Baptist Church flies the flag of Zimbabwe above the f lag of the United States .
The American flag is flown upside down .
For Memorial Day , the church issued a statement titled , `` They all died in vain for a filthy Sodomite nation led by perverts and whores . ''
In Kansas , Phelps ' parishioners
are known to picket the funerals of AIDS victims .
The reason they 'll travel to Goldwater 's service , he said , `` is because this nation needs to be preached to .
`` Its leaders need to be preached to .
And the best place to preach to the m is at their miserable funerals where they 're gathered around lying about each other . ''
You can read all about Phelps ' church on his Web site ( I swear I 'm not making this up ) : www.godhatesfags.com .
Among the many offerings available i s a transcript of a pamphlet titled ( Really , I 'm not kidding ) `` Mother Teresa in hell . ''
If Phelps is right , if hell _ the ultimate hot spot _ is filling up with the unholy likes of Goldwater and Sinatra and Princess Di and Mother Teresa , th ere 's only one thing left I 'd like to know .
Do they take reservations ?
