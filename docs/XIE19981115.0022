Palestinians Mark 10th Anniversary of Independence
JERUSALEM , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip marked on Saturday the 10th anniversary of the Tunis declaration of the Palestinian independent state .
Mass rallies and demonstrations were held in Gaza , Ramallah , Nablus and other cities of the territories under Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) control , to mark the anniversary , according to the Voice of Palestine .
In Nablus , north of the West Bank , thousands of people marched from the Philistine Street to the headquarters of the local government , where ceremonies were held in the presence of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Arafat told the gathering that the PNA has done everything possible to move the Mideast peace process forward and strived hard to bring peace to all Palestinians .
No matter what comes , Arafat proclaimed , he will declare an independent Palestinan state with Jerusalem as its capital on the territories next May .
Under the Oslo Accord signed in 1993 , the final-status talks between the Palestinians and Israel should be concluded as the five-year transitional period expires next May .
But in reality , such talks , which will solve the issues as refugees , border and the status of Jerusalem , have not started yet .
Arafat declared Palestine 's independence 10 years ago in Tunis , which has been recognized by many countries of the world .
In Ramallah , another West Bank city , thousands of people marched from Friends School to the downtown Manara Square .
PNA officials and local community leaders addressed the crowd .
In Gaza , students from the College of Education gathered at the Palestine Club to mark the anniversary .
Marches and rallies were held peacefully and no incidents were reported during the day .
