Imported Tanks Okay : Ugandan Commander
KAMPALA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- A senior army commander of Uganda has said that the newly imported tanks from Ukraine are operationally effective and useful .
Jeje Odongo , a major general and Uganda armed forces commander , made the remarks at a seminar in Jinja , 80 km east of Kampala , Wednesday , the New Vision paper said Thursday .
He said this in response to numerous press reports that few of the 62 imported tanks are operational and combat-worthy .
However , an officer in the Defense Minister 's office , who prefers to be unnamed , told Xinhua Thursday morning in a telephone interview that there is not yet any official report on the mechanic conditions of the equipment .
Odongo was quoted as saying that the tanks can serve defense purposes and that anybody doubting the effectiveness of the tanks can go to him for proof .
Previous reports said that the tanks are 30 years old , overpriced and not operational .
A member of parliament even said they are a big piece of junk .
The reports also said that there are fears that the tanks ' gun barrels rotate through 180 degrees instead of 360 degrees and that some tanks failed to reach their destination on their " maiden journeys . "
The general said that although freedom of speech is a right and a point which led to the liberation of Uganda , it should not be used to insult or provoke others .
