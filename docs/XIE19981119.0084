Julio Iglesias Plays " Trade Envoy " in Shanghai
SHANGHAI , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The Spanish singer Julio Iglesias was here today to promote trade and economic ties between his hometown of Valencia and Shanghai .
This was his first China visit as a ' trade ambassador ' , he said , adding that China has a lot of his fans and its rapidly developing economy has become more important .
Thirty years ago , the Spanish singer came to Shanghai and didn n't sell very well .
At that time , what impressed him most was the millions of bicycles , he recalled .
He says that he was the first to introduce pop music from the West and he believes that one day Asian songs will become popular worldwide .
But what Iglesia wanted to do today was to introduce the businessmen from Valencia who are here for a month-long Valencia Commodities Fair and he has an ad on the ticket of his upcoming concert that promotes the fair .
Valencia is an important trade , tourism , and shipping center in Spain and is the first of Spain 's autonomous districts to send a large trade delegation to China .
Over 20 Spanish journalists have joined the tour .
