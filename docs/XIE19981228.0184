Stability Applauded , Stimulus Awaited by Xu Haijing
BANGKOK , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- For the Thai economy , the year 1998 has been a year of joy and tear , hope and fear , anticipation and disillusionment .
Thais are happy to see that the baht has been stabilized , but they are frowning that the liquidity crunch remains in the real sectors , especially for small and medium-size enterprises .
The stabilization of the baht , which appears settled at between 35 and 36 to the U.S. dollar , compared with its weakest level of nearly 57 baht early this year , is seen as one of the most important achievements the Chuan Leekpai government has made .
Actually , Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has said on several occasions that stabilizing the baht and the financial sector reform were the government 's top priorities .
Without tackling these two major problems , it would be impossible to restore the economy to health .
After the closure of 56 ailing financial institutions at the end of last year , the Chuan government continued its effort on financial reforms in 1998 by intervening seven unhealthy financial companies .
The key to the financial sector reform is recapitalization and a policy package was announced in August which would allow the government to intervene in commercial banks ' recapitalization efforts .
Five of the 14 privately-owned commercial banks have been nationalized while Bangkok Bank of Commerce has been liquidated .
The August package helped restored public confidence in the health of the banking sector , bankers said .
They also said the crisis had taught the banks valuable lessons and they would have to revamp their credit analysis to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past .
All the reforms seem to be effective as the economy is showing first signs of recovery .
Foreign investors are regaining their confidence in the Thai economy as direct investments from January to July this year reached 3.3 billion dollars , exceeding that for the whole of 1997 .
The heavy burden of foreign debts , especially short-term debts , has been partly alleviated .
By December 10 , the total foreign debts of Thailand had been 84.7 billion dollars , compared with the 94.7 billion dollars before the government was forced to devaluate its currency in July 1997 .
Thailand 's foreign reserves , which was almost drained in the defense battles against the speculators last year , were recovered to 27.2 billion dollars in September this year , thanks to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) - brokered 17.2-billion-dollar bailout package .
Praised as a model student of the IMF , Thailand has successfully obtained loans from the organization through six letters of intent .
Not only did Thailand get loans from the IMF , but also approval of a larger budget deficit next year to stimulate the sagging economy .
Indeed , stimulation is needed at the time when the financial reforms are coming almost to an end .
Now it is time to enter the second stage of real sector reforms .
Though the Chuan government won praises for its achievements in tackling the crisis , criticism remains in some circles that the government has focused too heavily on reforming the financial sector and has made little effort to get other sectors moving again .
Masatsugu Nagato , country manager of the Industrial Bank of Japan ( IBJ ) , identified three conditions necessary to promote recovery , but said only one -- improving the current account which enjoys 15 billion dollar surplus -- had been tackled successfully .
The other two -- overcapacity and non-performing loans -- were being addressed much more slowly .
So far , only 53 percent of the factories in Thailand are in operation , while non-performing loans ( NPLs ) account for nearly 40 percent , or 57.5 billion dollars , of the total loans of all banks .
Some economists said one regret for the government is that it did not move to push interest rates down earlier , which could have helped to solve some of the NPL problems .
Even with a stable baht and substantially lower interest rates , new investment has not been stimulated because productive businesses can not obtain loans , said Chirayudh Vasuratna , secretary of the Thai Chamber of Commerce .
With high proportion of NPLs , banks are lukewarm to the government 's financial reform package .
Finance Minister Tarrin once hinted that tougher measures might be taken to force them to apply for recapitalization support from the 300-billion-baht ( 8.3-billion-dollar ) fund the government has set aside .
The money would come with strings attached : banks must speed up debt restructuring as well as making new loans .
The Thai government predicted earlier this year that the country will experience a seven to eight percent contraction this year , while the IMF and other international institutions forecast that Thailand will be " first in , first out " and bottom out of the crisis at the beginning of next year .
Hajime Kuwata , president of the Japan External Trade Organization , suggested : " The government needs to stimulate domestic demand and once this happens , Thailand would be the best place for economic growth of the ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations ) countries . "
