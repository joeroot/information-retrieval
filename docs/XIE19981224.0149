Consumer Goods Market Enters Low Profit Period
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's consumer goods market has entered into a sluggish period featuring low profits , according to experts from the State Statistics Bureau .
The bureau reported a 2.5-percent negative growth in the retail price index for the first 11 months of this year , with retail sales of consumer goods hitting 2.6 trillion yuan ( 313.51 billion U.S. dollars ) , a year-on-year rise of 6.6 percent .
Large and medium-sized department stores recorded a 4.2-percent decline in sales for the first 10 months of the year , with pretax profits falling by 17.2 percent .
The average profit margin for stores in Shanghai was below one percent for the first half , while more than two-thirds of the 132 large and medium-sized department stores nationwide recorded losses .
The State Administration of Internal Trade also provided similar reports .
According to the administration , the nation has 249 large department stores each with a floor space of above 10,000 square meters and annual sales exceeding 100 million yuan .
But for the first 11 months of the year , only 90-odd stores recorded a slight increase and the remaining 150 reported negative growth in sales .
The weak performance has , at least in part , been attributed to the fact that stores cut prices in an effort to reduce stocks and increase sales .
Experts also pointed that the current price war is not based on reduced production costs and will thus inevitably have an effect on economic returns .
