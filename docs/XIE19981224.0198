Analysts : China 's Economy Unlikely to Improve Great Deal
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The economic situation in China is unlikely to improve significantly next year due to the changes in both domestic and international markets , some analysts have said .
The analysts came to the conclusion at a recent forum on the Chinese economy organized by the State Council 's Development Research Center and the China Economic Reform Research Foundation .
According to Fan Gang , a noted economist with the China Academy of Social Sciences , the increase in investment will continue to be counter-balanced by unfavorable factors like reduced exports , lower incomes for farmers and high prices .
The forecast of a possible economic revitalization in Southeast Asia is not good news for China , Fan said , adding that it will not increase the demand but competitiveness of the region .
But he said that government investment this year is expected to have an effect on the economy in the first half of next year , since only 30 percent of the funds were utilized in projects this year .
However , if government funds are not able to stimulate more investment from business , then overall growth will very likely drop .
According to Yu Yongding , director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ' Research Institute of World Economy and Politics , economic growth rate in 1999 will do well to stay between 7.5 and eight percent .
The economic target set by the central government for this year is eight percent .
The State Economic and Trade Commission expects China to basically meet this goal or to get close .
Economic objectives for 1999 should be regarded as a guidance and not be expected to be guaranteed , according to Wu Shiguo , director of the Commission 's Economic Research Institute .
Economic growth everywhere in China was pretty bad in the first half of this year , but most places are reporting eight-nine percent for the second half , he said , adding that there must be some exaggeration or inaccuracy in these figures .
To maintain economic development , the experts agreed that efforts should be continued to expand domestic demand in such measures as stepping up construction of small towns and developing the urban housing market .
