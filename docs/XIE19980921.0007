Clinton Thanks African Americans for Support
WASHINGTON , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has thanked black Americans for " standing up for me and understanding the true meaning of repentance and atonement . "
Clinton , speaking at the annual dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus Saturday , credited black legislators for supporting his policies and helping to promote " this treasured moment of prosperity and progress . "
But Clinton laid out challenges yet to be conquered , everything from containing the global financial crisis to expanding access to health care and eliminating racism .
He said , " We can not rest .
We have work to do . "
Clinton listed a number of areas in which minorities are affected disproportionately , including certain health problems and fair housing .
Also he stressed the importance of making sure the next census does not leave out many minorities .
The president opened his remarks by offering special thanks " from the heart " to the caucus for its support in a time of trouble .
Representative Maxine Waters , a Democrat and chairwoman of the black caucus , got a standing ovation as she told her organization that while blacks do not always agree with the president , " We support Bill Clinton at this critical moment in his career , " adding " It is because African Americans are uniquely qualified to know unfairness when we see it . "
She said of the Lewinsky investigation , " Let the word go forth : The Congressional Black Caucus will be the fairness cops .
We will make sure at every step of the way Bill Clinton will have the opportunity to lay his case out without being jeopardized . "
