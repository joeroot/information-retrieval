Central Bank Gold Sales Exaggerated : Analyst
JOHANNESBURG , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The levels of central bank selling bandied about as the main reason for the current poor gold prices were grossly exaggerated and not large enough to destabilize the market , World Gold Council Manager George Milling-Stanley said here Thursday .
Only five central banks had off-loaded some of their reserves in the past few years , South Africa Press Association ( SAPA ) quoted him as saying .
Australia , he said , had recently off-loaded 67 tons while another 125 tons were sold by the Argentine Central Bank .
The Czech Central Bank had also recently sold about 25 tons .
" These sales last year were not even big enough to unbalance the market , " Milling-Stanley said .
The strength of the U.S. Dollar and the record level of spectacular short selling also contributed significantly to the flat prices in as much as the uncertainties over central banks ' selling did .
He said he expected no massive European sales in the future owing to the creation of a single currency under the European Central Bank .
He said annual demand shot up nine percent to a record 2,935 tons in 1997 following a strong fourth quarter performance which saw demand go up five percent to a record 754 tons .
Milling-Stanley expressed concern at the increase in gold theft from the mines .
" Knowledgeable people in the industry here ( in South Africa ) estimated that about 50 tons of gold are stolen every year , about 10 percent of production .
I find it very staggering .
If it is replicated worldwide then about one third of gold produced will not reach its destination , " he said .
