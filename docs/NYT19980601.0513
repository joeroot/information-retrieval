MILLER ACCEPTS HEFTY PAY CUT IN NEW PACT WITH GIANTS ( JT )

EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J .
_ The contract impasse between the Giants and linebacker Corey Miller will end Tuesday when Miller signs a restructured deal that calls for a substantial pay cut from the $ 1.5 million he was scheduled to make next season .
In an effort to trim their payroll , the Giants had considered releasing Miller , who has started 71 games for the team at linebacker , including 14 games last season .
Miller 's value dropped this winter when the Giants re-signed linebacker Marcus Buckley .
Coach Jim Fassel and his assistant coaches think Buckley can be the starter at Miller 's strongside linebacking position .
Buckley , however , is inexperienced as an every-down player , and the Giants had hoped to keep Miller , who is one of the more senior players on the team .
Until this weekend , Miller had spurned the team 's attempts to cut his salary by $ 600,000 or more .
But with the Giants scanning the waiver wire this week for quality veterans cast aside by other teams in payroll purges , Miller 's position with the Giants grew more tenuous .
The two sides came to a contract agreement _ laden with incentives and with a base salary below $ 1 million _ late Sunday .
After the workout of veteran and rookie players Monday at Giants Stadium , Fassel said he expected the team would soon have an announcement on Miller 's status .
Miller , 29 , was not at Monday 's workout , but Fassel said Miller was expected to attend a team workout on Tuesday .
`` We 've had discussions for the last several months on a possible restructuring , '' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said .
`` Hopefully , it can get consummated very quickly when he arrives Tuesday . ''
As with any player , the Giants could still cut Miller before the season begins and not have to pay his base salary .
More likely , Miller will join Buckley in a hybrid form of a strongside linebacker , with Miller playing more often in obvious run situations .
Miller had 23 tackles in 14 games last season .
He was a sixth-round draft choice of the Giants in 1991 .
He became a regular at linebacker in 1993 after two seasons of backing up Lawrence Taylor and Carl Banks .
