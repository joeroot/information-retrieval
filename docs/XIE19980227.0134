Almost Half of S. Africans Fear for Safety
JOHANNESBURG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Most South Africans view crime as a grave threat to the country 's well-being and almost half the population fear for their personal safety , according to a Survey .
The Star daily Friday quoted the 1998 Crime Index released by the Institute for Security Studies as showing that confidence in the government 's control over crime is declining and disapproval of the government 's handling of crime is growing , increasing the non - or under-reporting of crime .
Public 's confidence in the South African Police Service is also decreasing , according to a survey conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council , people generally trust the police despite being dissatisfied with the service they received .
South Africa has the world 's highest rape rate .
On average , more than 140 rapes and attempted rapes were reported every day during the first nine months of 1997 , Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said .
The number of actual rape cases could be much higher since only about half of all rapes and attempted rapes were reported to the police .
In South Africa , about 65 people were murdered per day on average .
But the government said repeatedly that serious crimes have been steadily declining since 1994 , only to be scorned by opposition parties and members of the public .
President Nelson Mandela said earlier this week that those who did not believe crime was declining were disloyal to the country .
