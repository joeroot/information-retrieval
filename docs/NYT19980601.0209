WASHINGTON _ How long can the U.S. economy keep up its world-beating dynamism of the past six years ?
Ask an economist , and you will probably hear a lot about inflation , interest rates and exuberant financial markets .
Ask someone who runs a business today , and the reply will be very different .
The chances are you will be told that the Achilles ' heel of America 's economic performance is a growing shortage of skilled labor .
More and more companies , particularly those using the most advanced technologies , say they are cutting back expansion plans _ or transferring some operations abroad _ because they simply can not find enough workers with the requisite skills in the United States .
Many people in business believe the shortage threatens not just the current economic expansion but America 's continuing domination of the computer and software technologies that will be crucial to prosperity in the 21st century .
Seen from this angle , a better way of putting the question might be : How long can a country whose high school students score so poorly in mathematics and science hope to retain world technological leadership ?
The problem affects virtually every kind of business .
According to a report just published by the Council on Competitiveness , a private , nonpartisan policy forum in Washington , there is `` an acute skills shortage in every part of the country that threatens the foundation of American competitiveness . ''
A senior Labor Department official likes to point out that nearly half of America 's high school graduates do not have the math skills necessary to get a job in a modern auto plant .
But the shortage is most acute in the information-technology industry , where estimates of unfilled vacancies run into the hundreds of thousands .
According to one industry leader , the unemployment rate in electrical engineering is a rock-bottom 0.4 percent .
There are two obvious ways of meeting the demand : Train more Americans or hire skilled workers from abroad .
But neither is very easy .
President Bill Clinton is threatening to veto a bill passed by the Senate that would increase the number of visas granted to high-technology workers from places such as India , Russia and Central Europe .
Labor unions complain , unreasonably , that the legislation risks discriminating against American workers and holding wages down .
With somewhat greater justification , they accuse employers of wanting only to hire young workers trained in the latest techniques , often straight from colleges and universities .
But the unions ought to be able to see that it makes more sense to bring the foreigners to America than to move the jobs to the foreigners .
U.S. companies should both be allowed to recruit the best of the foreigners , before they are snatched up by rival companies , and be encouraged to help train more Americans .
Unfortunately , according to the Council on Competitiveness , the United States has an aging work force and a youth population that is `` largely unprepared '' for highly skilled work .
`` In the coming years , '' the council says , `` new entrants to the work force will present an even tougher challenge : They are projected to be the least prepared and the most ethnically , racially , and gender diverse in history . ''
But there is also widespread agreement among experts that the American school system is not good enough at teaching the skills needed by industry , nor at inculcating the ambition to excel in science and math .
Many young people are more interested in what they see as get-rich-quick careers in entertainment or sports .
Business is not doing enough either _ training expenditure per worker appears to have fallen in the past 15 years .
But the Council on Competitiveness says it is still not too late to confront the skills challenge .
The important thing is to tackle it now , while the economy is still booming .
