BEIRUT _ In Saudi Arabia , it 's selling on the black market for $ 30 a pill .
In Egypt , it 's banned but costs $ 15 a pill under the counter .
In Lebanon , no man would even dream of suggesting he needed it _ which is just as well because the government refuses to import the drug until it has conducted tests .
But Viagra has arrived in the Middle East .
In the Arab world , male potency is not a subject you discuss over the dinner table _ or anywhere else _ because many men appear to be obsessed with the subject .
The production of children is regarded as proof of manhood .
A married man without children is constantly and publicly asked _ to the point of harassment _ why he has no offspring .
So is it any surprise that dreams of male virility are now running amok in the region ?
Egyptian chemists claim privately that they have been overwhelmed with requests for Viagra , which is one reason why the Cairo police and health ministry officials have been raiding pharmacies in the capital to hunt for the black market drugs .
According to Gamila Moussa , the deputy Egyptian health minister , Pfizer has applied for permission to sell the pills in Egypt .
`` But the drug is illegal and we want to test and try it before we allow it in our market , '' she says .
Already three Egyptians have been taken ill after using Viagra which the health ministry at first claimed Egypt 's highly productive male population did not need .
The government , a spokesman said , `` had taken account of the fact that the nature of the Egyptian man was different to that of an American . ''
Nonetheless 60 married men have voluntarily agreed to take Viagra , a step which was greeted by two of Egypt 's best known humorists , Ahmed Ragab and Mustafa Hussein in the daily `` Al-Akhbar , '' with a plea for government-subsidized contraceptives to offset the effects of the magical blue pill .
In the United Arab Emirates , Sheikh Mahmoud Khalifa , an official in the Department of Islamic Affairs , has announced that a married man might be permitted to use the drug with his wife but that it would be banned for unmarried men because it `` provokes vice . ''
But Dubai pharmacies are being inundated with telephone calls for the drug ; one man in his seventies offered nearly $ 60 for a single Viagra pill .
In Saudi Arabia , a single pill is selling for $ 20 under the counter in Jeddah but just under $ 50 in Riyadh _ what that says about the virility of Jeddah men remains to be seen .
In Yemen , there is talk of Viagra replacing the lethargic effects of qat , the nationally famous drug without which no holiday is complete ( its principal effect on the user is to make him fall asleep _ the very opposite of Viagra 's purpose ) .
Women , too , have been telephoning chemists in the Arab world , demanding to know if they have stocks of the pill .
In Lebanon , there hasn n't been a male potency drug around since the civil war _ when armed men would regularly shoot at migrating storks .
Boiled down , it was claimed , the birds ' beaks could be consumed , transforming the gunman 's sex life .
If Viagra really hits town , there are likely to be a lot more storks flying over the Middle East .
