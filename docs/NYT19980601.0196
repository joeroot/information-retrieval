WHY RHINOS AND TIGERS RECOMMEND VIAGRA

For all the hype , you might think that Viagra is the first drug designed to help men achieve and sustain an erection .
In fact there are many rival products .
Traditional Chinese medicine , especially , claims numerous treatments for invigorating the organ in question .
Yu Han , a Chinese-medicine specialist based in London , notes that most such medicines are parts of plants _ lotus stems , for example .
Since plants have also yielded many drugs recognized as effective by western medicine , it is likely that some of these herbal cures would withstand scientific scrutiny .
But the distinction between medicine and magic is often a fine one , and when `` cures '' are based not on the chemical diversity of plants but on the alleged attributes of wild animals , the success of any treatment is surely all in the mind .
Which is not much comfort to the animals involved .
Take tiger-penis soup , for instance _ and some apparently do .
It is supposed to endow men who consume it with the prowess of that mighty beast .
Tigers are not amused : only 5,500 - 7,500 are left in the wild , and dozens are poached and chopped up each year for use in traditional medicines .
At the moment , according to Steve Trent of the Environmental Investigation Agency in London , which studies `` crimes against nature , '' trade in tiger parts is killing more of the beasts than the destruction of their forest habitat .
And tigers are not alone .
Powdered rhinoceros horn is also a favored treatment for impotence ( fewer than 12,000 rhinos remain in the world ) , as are potions made with the remains of the masked palm-civet , an endangered mongoose-like animal .
Because they are endangered species , the trade in tigers , rhinos and civets involves poaching , smuggling and related treacheries .
All of this drives up costs , making such potions luxuries .
For the patient of ordinary means , therefore , something cheaper is required .
And stags have just the right sort of image .
Dried into a black and leathery state , stag penises are diced like carrots and then boiled to make soup .
No , it doesn n't taste just like chicken .
It tastes `` just like MSG , '' reports Hugh Baker , a professor of Chinese at the University of London .
Alcoholic infusions are also popular .
Three-penis wine ( made of the said parts of a dog , a stag and a seal ) is a popular standby .
Nine-penis wine ( don n't ask ) is slightly more expensive .
So is wine made with a special kind of gecko , a cheerful little lizard that is found throughout Southeast Asia .
Even snake penises are considered good .
In Hong Kong , they are soaked in herbs and liquor , aged for a couple of years , and then sold for up to $ 200 a bottle .
On the face of it , then , Asia should be a fertile market for Viagra , and tigers , rhinos and civets might thus have some of the pressure lifted from them .
But maybe not .
Asians do not doubt the virtues of western medicine .
Many , however , assume that traditional varieties are better for certain kinds of problems , `` vigor '' among them .
Still , Viagra _ unlike the folk remedies _ has clinical trials to prove that it works .
At a dose of 100 mg , Pfizer reports that 82 percent of men had improved erectile performance .
( It also notes , deadpan , that the drug is `` not indicated for use in newborns , children or women . '' )
Stag-penis soup , on the other hand `` didn n't do a thing for any of us who had it for dinner , '' says Dr. Baker .
