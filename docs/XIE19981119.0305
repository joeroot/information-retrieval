UK Court to Rule on Pinochet Next Wednesday
LONDON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Britain 's Highest Court , the House of Lords , said Wednesday that it would make its ruling on the extradition of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet next Wednesday .
If the highest court in Britain upholds a ruling same as the High Court , then the 82-year old general will be free to return home to Chile immediately .
Pinochet , who had ruled Chile for 17 years until 1990 , has been under guard in a London hospital since October 16 on a Spanish request for extradition on charges of alleged murder , torture and kidnapping .
He had been in Britain with a diplomatic passport for health reasons before he was kept under police guard .
British High Court had ruled out earlier this month that Pinochet was immune from prosecution .
