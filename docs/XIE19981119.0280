Philippine House Approves ' 99 National Budget
Manila , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The House of Representatives of the Philippines Wednesday night approved on third and final reading the 579.5-billion-peso ( 14.5 billion U.S. dollars ) national budget for 1999 .
A total of 139 voted in favor of the budget while 28 dissented , with no abstentions .
Members of the ruling majority , who were grumbling about the house leadership 's failure to accommodate their requests for funds for priority projects in their districts , had threatened to block the bill , house sources said .
But house leaders appeased the dissenters in the ruling majority during an all-member caucus late Wednesday afternoon .
Opposition congressmen rejected the bill and criticized the majority for " capitulating without putting up a fight against the Presidential Palace " to retain the lawmakers ' pork barrel fund , the sources said .
The final version of the budget included a reduction in the budget of the Bureau of Customs and additions to the Calamity Fund and public projects budget .
