Yearender : Mideast Peace Process Deep in dilemma
CAIRO , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Palestinian-Israeli peace accord , born in Washington on October 23 , ended a 19-month impasse in the Mideast peace process .
However , it failed to prevent the peace march from falling into another dilemma as Israel decided in December to hold early elections , shelving up the accord indefinitely .
Many believe that if the peace deal , called the Wye River Accord , proceeds smoothly , Lebanese-Israeli and Syrian-Israeli peace talks , the other two tracks in the Mideast peace process , derailed in 1996 , can be stimulated .
But the detente was short-lived , which was soon marred by a fresh wave of bickers , violence and bombings .
The hope-aspiring peace deal struggled to keep afloat , but was spoiled at last .
Israeli government suspended its implementation on December 2 only after the first of the three troops withdrawals , the key part in the accord , was carried out , following trading accusations of breaching the deal between the two sides .
Thus the world is lost about the fate of the hard-struck peace deal and the whole peace process , in view of the seemingly-unreconciling Palestinian-Israeli rows , the thorniest issues to be settled in the final status talks , the uncertainty in Israeli domestic politics with the collapse of the current government and the unpredictable early election results and the ominous deadlock in peace talks between Lebanon , Syria and Israel .
At the Wye River talks , U.S. president 's national security adviser Sandy Berger has said that " we got them back on talking to each other . "
After U.S. President Bill Clinton 's Mideast tour in December , he said that the U.S. aim now is to keep that discussion going .
But will they ?
Berger answered : " there is no guarantee in the Middle East . "
Reminded that Clinton had said that the peace process was back on track , he equipped : " it 's a bumpy track . "
What Berger summarized may be the most certain and clear-cut description that can be said about the peace process .
The Wye River Accord was the result of international efforts and concessions made by both Israel and the Palestinians , ending the impasse since March , 1997 when Israel broke ground for the Har Homa Jewish settlement in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem .
Envoys of the U.S. , European Union and Russia have shuttled between the two rivals and the Arab world has tried every means to collaborate with the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) while pressing Israel to give up its intransigence .
Apparently out of fear that the process might collapse , the U.S. efforts became serious early this year by raising a specific proposal , urging Israel to hand over an additional 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in return for tougher Palestinian actions on terrorism .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat were called to Washington on October 15 by Clinton , where they were kept for nine days in intense talks before the Wye River accord was hammered out .
Under the accord , besides Israeli troop pull-out and Palestinian crack-down on Islamic militants , 750 of the 3,000 jailed Palestinians would be released by the end of January , the Gaza airport will be opened and a safe-passage route between Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza would be set up .
The PNA also promised to revoke the clauses in the Palestinian national charter that calls for the destruction of Israel .
On November 20 , Israeli troops pulled out from 2 percent of the 13 percent from the West Bank , completing the first-phase redeployment under the Wye River accord .
Four days later , Gaza airport opened .
For the first time , the Palestinians have their own airport .
Meanwhile , Israel released 250 of the promised 750 jailed Palestinians .
Things seemed to be going on smoothly , but from the very beginning , some upsetting factors have already surfaced : Israeli government was compelled to sign the agreement ; the hawks in Netanyahu 's coalition had been threatening to topple him if he went ahead with the agreement ; Palestinian extremists who oppose peace making with Israel launched terror attacks on Israelis .
It was hard for Netanyahu to implement the Wye deal to its letter any more because he , since coming to power , has been adopting a balancing tactic , keeping the peace talks with Palestinians alive to cater to doves while not making concessions to anger the hawks .
Palestinians were angered first after they found that most of the freed Palestinians were common criminals , not political prisoners as they expected .
Widespread protests burst out in late November in the West Bank , which boiled over into violent street clashes , killing two Palestinian youths and injuring over 150 others .
Israel blamed the clashes on the PNA , accusing it of inciting violence against Israel , and announced the suspension of the peace accord .
Clinton , the major mediator in the peace-making , rushed to the region on December 13 to try to convince the two sides to stick to the items of the agreement .
But Netanyahu this time bucked the tradition to cave in to the U.S. pressure , he stuck to his intransigent position though the Palestine National Council , in the meantime , canceled the anti-Israeli references in the Palestinian national charter .
For now , the peace process most likely entered another sag as the agreement is believed to have been shelved when Netanyahu was put to struggle for his political survival following Israeli parliament decision on December 21 , dissolving the legislative body , abolishing the law of electing the prime minister directly and to hold early elections within six months .
Under the Oslo Accord between the Palestinians and Israel , the final status talks should have begun before may 1996 and the five-year interim period for Palestinian self-rule will expire on May 4 , 1999 .
But up till now , the two sides are still locked in a fight for land disputes .
Added to woes in the Middle East , peace talks between Syria , Lebanon and Israel showed no signs of revival in 1998 due to their disagreement over where the negotiations should be picked up .
Syria and its close ally Lebanon required the talks be resumed from where they were left off by the previous Labor government while Netanyahu 's administration says they should start from the very scratch .
Israel is occupying Syrian Golan Heights , a strategic plateau it captured in the 1967 Middle East War .
It also set up a self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas '' cross-border attacks .
Syria and Lebanon have vowed that they will not resume talks with Israel until it agrees to hand back the Golan Heights and unconditionally withdraw its troops from south Lebanon .
And they will not make peace with Israel separately as their disputes with Israel are interrelated .
U.S. Undersecretary for Middle East Affairs Martin Indyk said on December 18 that Washington is considering restarting the talks between Lebanon , Syria and Israel .
He predicted that once the talks were resumed , big progress could be achieved within a short time .
Nobody knows the real intention of the U.S. , the real power broker in the peace process .
But one thing is set for sure that 1998 has passed hopelessly .
The hope is pinned on 1999 that talks between Syria , Lebanon and Israel can be revived as soon as possible and Indyk 's predictions can come true .
