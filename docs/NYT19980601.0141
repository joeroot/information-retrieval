& HT ; ( -- -- - Please call or fax for a price quote . ) By TIM HERRERA ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & HT ; Thanks to past Father 's Days , I can go a month without washing underwear and my necktie collection rivals the discount racks at any department store .
As the father of four children , I own countless mugs , T-shirts and finger-paint artwork that read `` WORLD 'S GREATEST DAD ! ''
& HT ; I treasure every handcrafted present my three boys and one daughter have ever made , because they made them for me .
However , my hopes may be too high for 1998 .
& HT ; `` What do you want for Father 's Day this year ? ''
my boys asked .
& HT ; Despite the countless strips of colored cloth that seem to mate in my closet , I could always use another necktie .
Coffee-shop coupons beat scraping pennies off my dresser for a morning cup .
& HT ; But this year , I want something radical : I want peace on Father 's Day .
& HT ; I 'm not talking about world peace _ although that would be nice , too .
I want tranquility within the four walls of our two-story house .
& HT ; I answered , `` What if you guys quit fighting on Father 's Day ? ''
& HT ; You see , a day rarely goes by in our house without `` He hit me ! ''
followed by `` He hit me first ! ''
Then comes the witty `` Did-not-did-too ! ''
exchange .
& HT ; I 'm asking for a one-day truce , one that even NATO diplomats would have trouble arranging .
The treaty doesn n't have to be in writing _ I 'll accept a verbal agreement , with or without handshakes .
& HT ; But I want an entire day without hearing `` Dork ! ''
`` Dog breath ! ''
or something worse echoing through our house as the kids battle for the Nintendo , the VCR or the remote control _ my remote control .
& HT ; My request puzzled them .
Either they didn n't understand or they knew the mission was impossible .
I could tell they were hunting for an escape clause in an agreement they were reluctant to make .
& HT ; `` Yeah , no fighting 's good , Dad , '' they said .
`` But how ' bout if we go to the movies like we did last year ?
Maybe we can go see ` Godzilla ? '' ' & HT ; `` What the heck , '' I said .
`` Who needs peace and tranquility , anyway ? ''
& HT ; It seems we are forming a Father 's Day tradition .
Last year , we also commemorated the day by watching loud , frightening and scaly creatures engaging in noisy rampages .
No , we weren n't watching `` The Jerry Springer Show '' or anything on C-Span _ we went to see `` The Lost World . ''
& HT ; It was a memorable day , but not because of the film .
It was memorable because the outing was their idea .
& HT ; I ended up taking our two older boys _ ages 8 and 10 _ to the `` Jurassic Park '' sequel .
I felt the younger kids were too little to watch dinosaurs devour screaming humans , even at matinee prices .
& HT ; While driving to the theater with the boys , I started thinking about my father and the only time I could ever remember just the two of us going to the movies .
& HT ; It was a cool , spring Pennsylvania day .
Dad and I carried light jackets as we walked to the old Memorial Theater , strolling along the steep hills , past the Veterans Memorial and my school , St. Joseph 's Elementary .
& HT ; Dad was barely 5-foot-4 , but I was still much smaller and struggled to keep up with his quick stride .
& HT ; Sometimes I get angry because I can n't recall everything about that day .
However , I am grateful for one image still floating in my mind : I remember looking over , seeing the light from the movie screen flickering on Dad 's face and thinking how cool it was that he was just spending time with me .
& HT ; All the way home from the theater , I replayed the film for my father .
Since Dad laughed , I was positive he liked the Batman movie as much as I did .
But I never really found out _ I never thought to ask .
& HT ; Dad died about five years ago , and every third Sunday in June I think of our day at the movies .
& HT ; As my sons and I walked out of the theater after `` The Lost World , '' our eyes adjusting to the sunlight glaring off the parking lot , my middle son turned and asked : `` Dad , did you like the movie ? ''
& HT ; `` I sure did , pal . ''
& HT ; He 'll never know how glad I am that he asked .
& HT ; When we 're coming out of the theater this year , maybe I 'll catch them in a weak moment and ask them to pick up the smelly sweat socks they 've scattered from the corner of the kitchen to the edge of the driveway .
& HT ; While we 're at it , let 's have an armpit-noise ceasefire _ especially at the dinner table and at church .
& HT ; But perhaps I should just appreciate the time with them .
The time a child spends alone with his or her father is special .
Too often it 's taken for granted by both parent and child .
& HT ; Maybe peace at home on Father 's Day is a bit much to ask .
Maybe all we need is another nice monster movie and some time together to create some moments worth reliving .
