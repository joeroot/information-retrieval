Starr Expected to Go Beyond Lewinsky Matter in Testimony
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was given leeway Wednesday to go beyond the Monica Lewinsky matter as he makes his case at U.S. President Bill Clinton 's impeachment hearing Thursday .
With Republicans and Democrats getting ready for a partisan fight at the hearing Thursday , Starr prepared a presentation that would portray the Lewinsky matter as the core of a pattern of lying and obstruction of justice , according to reports .
Chairman Henry Hyde of the House Judiciary Committee , a Republican , has allotted Starr two hours to give his evidence to members of the House Judiciary Committee .
Starr 's presentation will be followed by questions from committee investigators , lawmakers and Clinton 's private lawyer David Kendall .
Starr 's appearance " won n't be a straight recitation " of his written report submitted in September , said his spokesman , Charles Bakaly .
Democrats were angry that Starr was given authority by Hyde to delve into matters such as the Whitewater real estate transactions , misuse of FBI files , firings at the White House travel office and payments to presidential friend Webster Hubbell .
" This is an impeachment in search of a crime , " complained James Jordan , spokesman for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee .
The Clinton administration , given 30 minutes to cross-examine Starr , assigned Kendall , who has accused Starr of leaking grand jury material and has relentlessly pursued a contempt of court motion against him .
On Tuesday , Hyde wrote the White House that Clinton 's lawyer wouldn n't be allowed to question Starr about the various controversies surrounding his investigation , such as the grand jury leak investigation and his contacts with Paula Jones ' lawyers .
Hyde also pressed the administration to answer the committee 's 81 questions about Clinton 's conduct and respond to the Republicans ' request for material that could help Clinton 's case .
Clinton 's spokesman , Joe Lockhart , said it appeared the Republicans were off on an unfair , unconstitutional " partisan adventure . "
Speaking to reporters prior to Clinton 's departure for Asia , Lockhart said that Republicans are seeking to muzzle the president 's defenders while attempting to broaden their investigation .
" They have rediscovered all of their old bad habits and since they don n't like where it 's going , they 're going to try to find something else , " Lockhart said .
