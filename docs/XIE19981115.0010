Annan Terms Iraqi Letter on Inspections as " Positive "
UNITED NATIONS , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday described an Iraqi letter on U.N. weapons inspections as " positive " , saying that he believed it met U.N. requirements in resolving the latest crisis .
A letter from Baghdad , handed to the U.N. chief at his residence shortly before 10 : 00 a.m. EST by the Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations , Nizar Hamdoon , would be submitted to the Security Council later in the day .
Asked if the letter met U.N. requirements , he said " Yes , in my view it does . "
" The letter is a reply to the letter sent last night by the Secretary-General to ( Iraqi ) President Saddam Hussein , following the meeting of the Security Council , " which ran about five hours into late on Friday , a U.N. spokesman said on Friday morning .
The Security Council is scheduled to convene closed-door consultations on Iraq at 3 : 30 p.m. EST on Saturday , as war threat looms in the gulf by the U.S. efforts to increase its military buildup in the region .
The letter also came shortly after Iraq Saturday announced that it allowed unconditional return of U.N. arms inspectors in an attempt to defuse the current crisis which threatens an imminent U.S. military strikes .
Hamdoon told reporters that Iraq was going to cooperate fully with arms inspection teams of the U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
" The Iraqi leadership has decided to resume full and complete cooperation with both the UNSCOM and the IAEA , " the Iraqi ambassador said , " They will be allowed in the minute they would like to go and resume their normal work . "
He said one of Iraq 's goals have been met , that is , Baghdad had made it known to the world its views and everyone was now aware of what Iraq wants .
Iraq wants movement toward the lifting of 8-year economic sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990 .
Disarmament of its weapons of mass destruction is one key requirement for lifting the sanctions .
Iraq declared the suspension of all cooperation on August 5 with U.N. inspection teams , and on October 31 , Baghdad stopped the remainder of the inspections , prompting UNSCOM to pull its staff out of Iraq on " strong recommendation " from Washington .
