Zambian President Calls for Joint Defense
LUSAKA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba Wednesday called for joint training among forces in Africa to solve common defense problems , the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation ( ZNBC ) reported .
Speaking at the graduation ceremony of 53 senior defense officers at the Defense Commander Staff College , Chiluba said joint defense training among African forces is an " ultimate " solution to conflicts which hinder the region 's economic development .
Although the Cold War between the West and the East has ended for many years , conflicts in the African continent seem to be endless since new conflicts such as the escalating hostilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have emerged and the old ones remain to be resolved .
" As soon as this position is taken , the lesser will be the destruction of life and property , " noted the Zambian leader .
" We must continously cooperate in joint training among our defense forces in order to achieve common approach to common defense problems of our region , " he added .
Chiluba observed that the forces of the 14-member Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) must interact more and more in various fields of training " to enhance common knowledge and remove areas of misunderstanding . "
He also called on defense personnel to unite and cooperate so that they can achieve stability and economic development in the region .
