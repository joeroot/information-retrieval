REAL QUIET BOUND FOR GLORY IF TRIPLE CROWN BID SUCCEEDS
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By RANDY MOSS c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
He isn n't as fast or good-looking as Secretariat was , and his nickname of `` The Fish '' doesn n't stack up well with `` Big Red , '' either .
Unlike Affirmed , he hasn n't had a rival like Alydar to push him to breathtaking performances .
And he has lost more races than he has won , whereas Seattle Slew lost only three times in his career .
But if Real Quiet wins the Belmont Stakes on Saturday , opposing trainers say he will deserve to be ranked alongside those famed 1970s horses as a deserving Triple Crown champion .
`` He possibly might not have the charisma or mystique that some of the other Triple Crown winners have had , '' said Elliott Walden , who trains Kentucky Derby and Preakness runner-up Victory Gallop .
`` But he did go through a tremendous grind with this thing .
If he were to do it , I would definitely think he 's deserving of being in the elite category . ''
Real Quiet 's half-length Kentucky Derby victory was considered an upset by most .
Even his trainer , Bob Baffert , thought that stablemate Indian Charlie , who finished third , had more natural ability .
In the Preakness Stakes , Real Quiet came into his own with a convincing victory despite running wide around the difficult turns at Pimlico Race Course .
Now the crooked-legged $ 17,000 purchase stands on the brink of racing history , not to mention a guaranteed $ 5 million payday .
No 3-year-old has swept the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978 , and only three horses have accomplished the feat since Citation in 1948 .
But Real Quiet 's competition has been described as merely average .
He never had to meet quality horses such as Lil 's Lad , Event of the Year and Coronado 's Quest , who were knocked out of the races with various ailments .
Victory Gallop is scheduled to try again in the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes , but `` 50 - 50 '' Grand Slam would be the race 's only Grade 1 winner other than Real Quiet .
But that shouldn n't diminish the difficulty of sweeping the classics , said D. Wayne Lukas .
Although Lukas has never trained a Triple Crown winner , his horses have won three Derbies , four Preaknesses and three Belmonts .
`` Triple Crown winners occur in two ways , '' Lukas said .
`` You get a very , very superior horse that just dominates his class , or you get a very good racehorse with good durability .
`` Real Quiet isn n't getting much respect right now .
He appears to be a horse in the right place at the right time .
But you have to be careful on deciding whether they 're worthy or not until some time goes by , until later in their career .
He may be a horse that 's better than we think . ''
Lukas , who will run Yarrow Brae and possibly Grand Slam in the upcoming Belmont , used last year 's Triple Crown races as an illustration of the pitfalls of judging the quality of developing young horses .
When Silver Charm won the Derby and the Preakness , he was being widely hailed as a deserving Triple Crown winner until he lost the Belmont to Touch Gold .
But , Lukas points out , Silver Charm won the Derby by a head over Captain Bodgit , who ducked in sharply in the stretch run .
Silver Charm had another close call in the Preakness , when Touch Gold had a nightmarish trip and was arguably the best horse .
`` Most people thought ( Silver Charm ) was a hell of a horse and still do , '' Lukas said .
`` They heralded him as a top horse , yet , with a couple of nods here and there , he could have gone 0-for-3 .
`` So now you 've got Real Quiet , who dominated the Derby and dominated the Preakness and looks like ( an ) odds-on ( favorite ) in the Belmont .
And he gets very little respect .
I guess you could say he 's in a no-win situation . ''
Baffert believes the answer is simple .
He said Real Quiet is deserving of accolades if he proves talented and durable enough to win all three races .
But if he doesn n't win the Belmont , he is simply another good horse who couldn n't quite stand up to the rigors of an intense five-week schedule that thwarted recent would-be sweepers such as Alysheba , Sunday Silence and Silver Charm .
`` Better horses ( than Real Quiet ) might have gotten beat in the Triple Crown , '' Walden acknowledged , `` but it takes a special horse to be able to win all three .
If he can pull it off , he should be deemed special , too . ''
And Baffert is confident that Real Quiet will respond to that challenge .
`` I 'll take anybody on , '' he said .
`` This horse is getting better and better .
He 's just a big long-striding horse who inhales these horses .
I 'm the only guy who possibly can screw this up . ''
