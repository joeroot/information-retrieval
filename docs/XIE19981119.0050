European Stock Markets In Losses
LONDON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) - A healthy start in European stock markets Wednesday proved to be short-lived as early gains in share prices quickly melted away and then turned into losses .
London 's FTSE was up 4 percent at 5524.5 , or 21.8 points early in the morning .
The US Fed 's third interest rate cut in two months had sparked an early rush of buying , which helped the Footsie build a 50-point lead in the first ten minutes of the morning .
But that was as good as is got , with investors left to dwell on the deteriorating economic situation in the UK .
And the FTSE 100 ended the day 29 points lower at 5 , 474 , at its low for the day .
German share prices were mixed but mainly lower in late trade as dealers watched an indifferent start to US trade .
The leading Dax index closed down 4 points at 4 , 698 .
The later trading Xetra Dax index was down 17 points at 4,701 near its close .
French stocks shed early gains , the CAC 40 opened up 1.51 percent at 3 , 6559 , but finished up 11 points at 3 , 612 .
" Basically , we 've acknowledged the US rate cut by opening higher , and now we 're sliding back , " said Jean Faivre , trader at brokerage CLC Bourse .
