Soros Sees Recession Risk
NEW YORK , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. billionaire financier George Soros warned that the global economy is facing the risk of recession in the next couple of years despite the current stock market revival , said a report in the Newsweek magazine .
The U.S. stock market is expected to retest previous lows probably next year despite the current record highs in the wake of three rounds of interest cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve since September 29 , he told the December 7 issue of Newsweek .
The U.S. economy is amid a " fairly mature boom " and faces growing cost pressures while Japan is still in recession and Brazil may follow suit , although it has received an aid package of 41.5 billion U.S. dollars , he said .
Under the situation , the global economy " is liable to slip into a recession next year or the year after , " he asserted .
Soros made a fortune in previous years through his fund management business .
As the Asian financial crisis has been spreading , his 20 billion dollar Quantum group of hedge funds has suffered loses this year , like many other hedge funds have .
He believed that international cooperation and global efforts could help stabilize the world financial system .
" To put it bluntly , the choice confronting us is whether we will regulate global financial markets internationally or leave it to each individual state to protect its own interests as best as it can , " he said .
