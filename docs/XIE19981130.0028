Iran Condemns Israeli Attacks on South Lebanon
TEHRAN , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi condemned Israel 's recent attacks on south Lebanon , the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Monday .
In separate telephone calls with his Lebanese and Syrian counterparts on Sunday , Kharrazi voiced Iran 's concern over the latest developments in south Lebanon and reiterated its support for Lebanon 's resistance against " the Israeli aggressions and usurpation . "
Israeli warplanes on Sunday blasted suspected positions of Lebanese guerrillas in south Lebanon in retaliation for the killing of seven Israeli soldiers in the past two weeks .
The Iranian minister said the recent Israeli measures are aimed to delay its withdrawal from south Lebanon .
Israel should withdraw its troops from Lebanon without any preconditions , he stressed .
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and Syrian Foreign Ministers Farouq al-Sharaa respectively briefed Kharrazi on the latest developments in south Lebanon and widespread concern over more Israeli operations .
They stated that the Lebanese people and army will continue to resist Israeli occupation , according to IRNA .
Israel set up a self-declared " security zone " in south Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions , with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks .
Israel has criticized Syria of supporting Lebanese guerrillas in escalating attacks against Israel , and of using south Lebanon as a bargaining chip to force Israel return the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Mideast War .
