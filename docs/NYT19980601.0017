CHAMPIONS CONFRONT MORTALITY

CHICAGO _ The game took 2 hours 34 minutes , and for Michael Jordan , it had to feel like 15 brutal rounds , the way it felt years ago for the aging Muhammad Ali .
Jordan once flew the way the young Ali danced , but at 35 , against Larry Bird 's swarming Indiana Pacers , in the fourth quarter of a seventh game , Jordan had nowhere to go but the clinches .
He fought in flurries .
He went to the boards .
He drove the ball into a crowd of hacking behemoths .
He and his team won with heart and guile and , like Ali until he had nothing left , because Jordan had promised that was precisely what he would do .
`` He 's been the greatest , '' his coach , Phil Jackson , said without prompting after Jordan and the Bulls won Game 7 , 88 - 83 , on Sunday night and survived the Eastern Conference finals against an opponent Jordan earlier in the series had mistakenly classified as nothing more daunting than a `` bump in the road . ''
As it turned out , the Bulls began their ascent over this bump when Jordan won a jump ball from a 7-footer .
It was the middle of the fourth quarter and the Bulls were sagging , with Jordan struggling , with their front line plagued by fouls .
They were trailing by 77 - 74 .
They were waiting for Jordan to do something , anything , to bail them out .
Jordan drove into the lane against the long-armed Derrick McKey , who reached in as Jordan neared the basket and stripped Jordan of the ball .
It rolled on the floor , toward Rik Smits .
Jordan , falling backward , reached around and , with Smits , got a hand on the ball .
Jordan somehow won the jump .
Steve Kerr wound up with an open 3-point shot on the right wing .
The score was tied .
The message was sent .
Jordan was going to drag his team to Salt Lake City , to its sixth championship series .
Twenty-eight points on a night when his jump shot wasn n't falling , when every advance to the basket brought a double-team .
Eight assists on a night when , more than ever , he had to have help .
Nine rebounds on a night when the Bulls essentially won the game with second shots .
With hustle plays .
With the directive to stop the whining over every call or play that didn n't go their way .
`` I just told them to shut up and play , '' Jordan said .
The time had come for them to put aside the preoccupation with their uncertain future and get in touch with the precious present .
Time to forget the insipid organizational feuds , their contractual complaints and the overblown burden of being the Bulls .
Time to take any contribution they could get , including a 14-point perimeter explosion by Toni Kukoc , the one-time obsession of Jerry Krause , the general manager , whom Jackson , Jordan and Scottie Pippen heartily despise .
A couple of weeks sooner than anyone thought was likely , the time had come to stare down dynastic mortality , a predicament one must inevitably confront without the spiritual aid of an agent .
Until Sunday night , with Jordan purifying their lineup the Bulls had not even been extended to a seventh game of a playoff series since 1992 .
That was when Pat Riley 's New York Knicks put a second-round choke hold on Pippen , but inevitably played Game 7 at the old Chicago Stadium with an exceedingly motley crew that featured a slow-footed point guard named Mark Jackson , whose push shot often landed uglier than it took off .
The lack of a companion superpower to effect a balance of power has created an annoying haughtiness about the Bulls , a wart that seems to have become visible to the country during the Indiana series .
This particular Bulls championship quest has become as emotional as a deposit into a savings account .
And when the balance sheet didn n't add up , it was always the fault of the bank .
This is not to say that Jordan 's Bulls haven n't been pushed , haven n't flirted with the sudden-death dangers of a seventh game .
Someone in a national sports magazine commented last week that this year 's Utah Jazz might actually be determined enough to force a truly competitive finals , forgetting that three of the Bulls ' four victories in last year 's finals were undecided until the game 's final shot .
Someone , usually Jordan , has made the big shot to save them the humiliation of having to squirm the way they did on Sunday night , big time in prime time .
Pippen or Horace Grant or Dennis Rodman has come up a big defensive play .
One season 's finals opponent would fade away , not to be heard from again .
A new challenger would step up the following season .
Suddenly , the year Bulls management has been threatening , win or lose , to dismantle its aging champion , John Stockton and Karl Malone are waiting in Salt Lake City , with the home-court advantage .
With many observers , this one included , believing this is Malone 's and Stockton 's year to get over a pretty big hump themselves .
`` Is some of the swagger gone ? ''
Jordan said , after admitting what a chore this night really was .
`` Probably . ''
On the other hand , instead of just expecting to win , the Bulls had to get in touch with their vulnerable side to clear the bump at home .
Now on to Salt Lake City , to see if Jordan can still scale a mountain .
