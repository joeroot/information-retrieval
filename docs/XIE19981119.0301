Annan Meets With NATO Chief on Kosovo
UNITED NATIONS , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with visiting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana here Wednesday evening , saying that " we are working very closely in Kosovo , " a Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians make up a majority of the population .
Fresh from the meeting , Solana told reporters that he discussed with Annan on such issues as Bosnia and Kosovo , the two regions he said NATO had " close cooperation " with the United Nations on the ground .
" We have a lot of things in agreement , " he said .
" We are working together in Bosnia and Kosovo , " and " We have very very profound relations . "
Solana said he was glad to see a resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council Tuesday , condemning Yugoslavia 's failure to cooperate with war crimes investigators and demanding the arrest of three men charged with organizing an alleged massacre of more than 200 Croats in 1991 .
Without the authorization of the United Nations , NATO has threatened to use military force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the question of Kosovo , which was considered by Belgrade an internal affair .
Such a unilateral decision came under strong fire from most Security Council members .
NATO , after an agreement with Belgrade , has set up a mission of verification , manily from air , to monitor Yugoslav compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions .
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) has also sent personnel to monitor Belgrade 's compliance on land in Kosovo .
On Wednesday , Annan said he would not recommend the establishment of a United Nations political presence in Serbia 's province of mainly ethnic Albanians in order to avert what he said might turn out as reporting confusion over the situation on the ground .
In his report to the Security Council , Annan said , " It is quite obvious that any need that might have existed for such a presence has been superseded by the decision to establish the Kosovo Verification Mission . "
Since the Kosovo Verification Mission , made by up of 2,000 monitors from the OSCE , will report to the Security Council , the decision not to establish a United Nations political presence will serve to avoid " parallel reporting channels that might lead to confusion and overlapping in the field , as well as necessary financial expenditure . "
At the current stage , it is important to develop clear channels of communication between the OSCE and the United Nations on the issue of Kosovo , where conflicts originated from ethnic Albanians ' bids for independence , he said .
