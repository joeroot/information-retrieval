Egypt Not to Privatize Oil Refineries : Minister
CAIRO , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi Al-Banbi on Sunday ruled out the possibility of privatizing the country 's oil refineries .
Al-Banbi told a meeting of the General Assemblies of Oil Refineries that Egypt has " no intention to privatize or sell " the oil refineries as they " are strategic " for the national economy .
But he assured that " the door is open " to the private sector to build new refineries or set up specialized companies to operate in the field .
Under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund , Egypt started economic reforms in 1991 , featuring privatization of state-run companies .
So far , more than one third of the 314 enterprises selected in the process have been sold to the private sector .
The minister said that Egypt 's refineries with an annual production of 30 million tonnes are able to meet the needs of domestic consumption and economic and social development .
Egypt has planned to modernize the refineries in a bid to expand their production capacity and raise the quality of the products to the world level in the coming century , Al-Banbi said .
