CHALLENGERS LINE UP FOR BELMONT
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By KEVIN MODESTI c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES _ When Real Quiet 's van arrives at Belmont Park in New York on Wednesday , the colt might find as many as 11 opponents and 1 { miles of mud standing between him and thoroughbred history .
At least eight challengers have been lined up , which is more than any the 11 Triple Crown winners faced in their Belmont Stakes victory .
The eagerness of rival owners to take on the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner confirms the obvious , that not everybody sees Real Quiet as a great horse worthy of mention alongside Count Fleet , Citation and Secretariat .
The debate promises to dominate this week leading up to Saturday 's Belmont Stakes : Is Real Quiet somehow unworthy of a Triple Crown because of his 4-for-14 record and the fact that injuries to some other top 3 year olds have simplified his task ?
Real Quiet is scheduled to put in his last serious , 5-furlong workout this morning at Churchill Downs in Louisville , Ky. , and fly and van to Belmont on Wednesday morning along with owner Mike Pegram , trainer Bob Baffert and jockey Kent Desormeaux .
The weather was pleasant on Long Island on Monday .
Thunderstorms are predicted today and Wednesday .
The long-range forecast for Saturday has partial cloudiness and temperatures in the 80s _ but the skies can change quickly on the Atlantic coast .
The weather could be a factor , because Real Quiet ran the worst race of his career on a mucky surface at Golden Gate Fields in Albany , Calif. , in January .
Desormeaux said Monday morning he 's having trouble sleeping .
Not only would Real Quiet become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed 20 years ago , his team would divide a $ 5 million bonus from Visa for sweeping the three races .
Including the winner 's share of the $ 500,000-added Belmont purse , the California-based horse could earn the biggest racing payday .
`` I 'm so anxious for the race _ to find my destiny , so to speak , '' said Desormeaux , 28 , from his home in Bradbury .
`` I 'll definitely have the weight of history on my shoulders .
But I feel very fortunate just to be the lucky pilot in the saddle with the opportunity . ''
The field and post positions will be set Thursday morning .
As of Monday , eight horses were on the `` probable '' list .
They included five horses Real Quiet has already defeated _ Derby and Preakness runnerup Victory Gallop ( Gary Stevens riding ) , Classic Cat ( John Velazquez ) , Hot Wells ( Calvin Borel ) , Parade Ground ( Pat Day ) and Basic Trainee ( Joe Bravo ) ; and three new challengers _ Yarrow Brae ( Jerry Bailey ) , Thomas Jo ( Chris McCarron ) and Raffie 's Majesty ( Jorge Chavez ) .
Officially dropping off the list Monday was Silver Launch , who came out of a Sunday workout with an ankle chip that will require surgery .
Three other horses are listed as `` possible '' starters : Grand Slam ( rider undetermined ) , who recovered from a nasty injury at age 2 to win the Peter Pan at Belmont nine days ago ; Hanuman Highway ( Jose Santos ) , who was seventh in the Derby ; and lightly raced Limit Out ( Jean-Luc Samyn ) .
Grand Slam trainer D. Wayne Lukas might wait as late as Wednesday before announcing a decision .
Hanuman Highway trainer Kathy Walsh plans to make up her mind today .
Limit Out trainer Allen Jerkens is aiming for Wednesday .
The 11 Triple Crown winners faced as many as seven and as few as two horses in the Belmont .
By contrast , of the 13 Triple Crown hopefuls who were tripped up in the Belmont , seven were up against eight or more horses .
`` Every night , I find myself wondering how the race is going to be run , '' Desormeaux said .
`` ( But ) it 's hard to dream about the race when you don n't know who the players are yet . ''
