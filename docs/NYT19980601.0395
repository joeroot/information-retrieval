` SAVVY ' RADIO HOST HAS TRAVELED FAR AND WELL , ISN ' T DONE YET
( For use by N.Y .
Times News Service clients ) By BARBARA YOST c.1998 The Arizona Republic
( UNDATED ) _ After covering politics and hard news for the Washington Post and `` Washingtonian '' magazine for 22 years , Rudy `` The Savvy Traveler '' Maxa might miss delving into scandals in the nation 's capital .
For a moment , maybe .
Then he 's off for a weekend in Hong Kong .
He
might jet to London for dinner .
He has traversed Europe , done Asia , explored Africa .
What 's Monica Lewinsky to a man who once was detained for four hours in Port Said , Egypt , and paid off his captor with $ 30 cash and a few minutes of fawning
over the general 's photos of Mickey Mouse ?
When you owe your life to the Mouse , you 're not eager to return to the Washington rat race .
Nine years ago , in fact , Maxa turned down an offer to contribute political commentary to Public Radio Intern ational 's `` Marketplace '' series .
`` I really care ( about politics ) , '' he says , `` but I don n't have a point of view .
I just like to watch the circus .
I don n't care what clowns are in it . ''
These days , Maxa is more likely to run into one of
those fancy French clowns in Paris than Bozo on the banks of the Potomac .
As host of PRI 's `` Savvy Traveler '' program , he 's either traveling the world or advising his listeners on how to do it .
Between his radio work , a gig writing a business - travel column for `` Worth '' magazine and writing business-travel columns for MSNBC and abcnews.com , Maxa has to make time to actually take the trips he 's still dreaming of .
But ask him when the bulls are running in Pamplona , Spain , or the tul ips are blooming in Amsterdam , the Netherlands , and he has the information at his fingertips .
`` Savvy Traveler '' has been on the air just 10 months and already is heard in 125 cities , including 18 of the top 30 markets .
The show 's produc er is J.J .
Yore , who knew Rudy back in Washington .
When Yore moved to California to produce `` Marketplace , '' he asked Maxa to contribute political commentary .
Insisting he lacked the opinions of , say , a firebrand such as Pat Buchanan , Maxa instead p itched the idea of a consumer-oriented travel segment .
The boy Rudy , an Army brat raised primarily in Europe , had always been fascinated by airlines ' too-good-to-be - true offers .
He developed the habit of reading fine print and amazed his frie nds by quoting limits and restrictions on so-called good deals .
Those instincts served him well when he grew up to write articles advocating for the travel consumer .
At first , however , Yore did not share his enthusiasm for the notion of a travel segment .
`` We 're a business show , '' he told Maxa .
`` There are business travelers ! ''
Maxa pointed out .
Savvy Rudy was on his way .
A year ago , Yore decided Maxa 's segments had become so successful they deserved to be spun off into their own show .
`` The Savvy Traveler '' was born .
`` Savvy '' since has developed into a combination of `` Car Talk , '' `` Oprah Winfrey '' and the Encyclopaedia Britannica of Travel Information .
Like Click and Clack , the `` Car Talk '' gu ys , Maxa fixes listeners ' broken vacation plans .
Can n't afford Majorca ?
How about Puerto Vallarta ?
Like a one-man reference library , he spews data about happenings in the four corners of the world .
Hoping to attend the Rose of Tralee Festival in Tralee , Ireland ?
Maxa has the time , place , admission price .
Every show offers the travel Deal of the Week _ cheap airfares , for instance .
There is a theme of the week _ call in with your stories of vacation horrors or the most useful foreign p hrase .
( Please and thank you are rivaled only by `` ein bier , bitte '' _ the proper way to order a beer in Germany . )
Freelancers contribute reports from exotic places , such as a hotel where scuba-diving guests enter the lobby underwater .
` ` Savvy Traveler '' invites listeners to call a toll-free number with their responses to weekly themes and with questions for Maxa .
Producers work their magic , logging the messages and phoning respondents to arrange a time when Maxa can call them .
Then , Maxa sits at the phone for several hours , laptop and Rolodex at his side , and calls listeners in succession , recording for the next week 's show .
The format works and is necessary because different radio stations air the program at d ifferent times and days .
Actual live call-ins would be impossible .
With all the work Maxa does as a travel journalist , he stays abreast of the industry .
`` I 'm trying to keep new , '' he says , making an effort to travel whenever possible .
T his summer , the divorced father of two is taking his son on a barge trip through Burgundy , France .
Alex , 15 , will pilot the barge ( it 's not as hard as it sounds , Maxa says ) while Pop sits on deck and enjoys a glass of _ what else ?
_ Burgundy .
At age 48 , Maxa has done the usual destinations and now is longing to visit more out-of-the-way places such as Australia , New Zealand , Cambodia , Vietnam .
He 's almost breathless naming the miles he has to go before he sleeps at the microphone .
As he jets around the world , he 's not one to crash at a hostel or grab a snack on his way up a mountain .
Maxa is no Rick Steves , whose public-television series on European travel finds him happily bunking in someone 's spare room and counting a hot b ratwurst as fine dining in Berlin .
Maxa tends toward the upscale , even bringing gourmet meals on airlines where dinner is a sack lunch .
His seatmates turn green with envy , he says .
He also likes a nice hotel _ mint on the pillow , please .
Not that Maxa is averse to roughing it .
He once wrote an article for the Washington Post headlined `` A wimp 's week in the wild . ''
But he 's a wimp with good taste .
`` Let someone else do the adventure travel , '' he says .
`` I want room service . ''
