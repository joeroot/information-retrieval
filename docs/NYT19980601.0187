FILTHY RICH AMERICANS AND PHILANTHROPY

At the turn of the century , with the economy booming and inequality on the rise , the Salvation Army threw a dinner party at Madison Square Garden .
The stadium 's lights beamed down on thousands of poor people tucking into free food .
The rich hired boxes and galleries to savor their philanthropy .
Everybody sang `` Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow . ''
It was hailed by the Salvation Army Commander as `` the dawning of a new era , the bridging of a gulf between the rich and poor . ''
Over the next quarter-century the masses at the trestle tables turned on the elite in the galleries .
The icons of American capitalism _ the Rockefellers , Morgans and Vanderbilts _ were denounced as `` robber barons '' and `` malefactors of great wealth . ''
Antitrust policy was used to cut them down to size , higher taxes to narrow the inequalities they had created , and tariffs to stop them exporting American jobs .
The stock market crash of 1929 ( also their fault ) led the government to interfere even more in business .
Then came the Depression .
A simplistic account , no doubt , but one that America 's new rich might review .
For if 1900 marked the high point of one era of wealth creation , with enormous riches for those who seized new national markets just then opening up , 2000 may mark another , with the opportunities flowing this time from globalization , new technology and corporate restructuring .
America , at the last count , had 170 billionaires , compared with 13 in 1982 .
In many cases , the rich have got richer by doing rather little .
An American who had $ 500,000 in shares and a $ 500,000 New York apartment 15 years ago , and has merely held on to them , is now $ 5 million better off .
The cliche that America 's poor are too busy striving to have time for envy still rings true .
Just now the economy is doing so well that everybody is getting ahead .
But inequality has increased sharply over the past 30 years , and this has not gone unnoticed .
In newspaper cartoons , Bill Gates has evolved from geek-hero to bullying monopolist _ very Rockefelleresque .
`` Titanic , '' the blockbuster movie , offered a bracingly Marxist view of events , and the delight of American audiences when one or two rich passengers went under was , er , chilling .
Barely a week passes without news of some executive hauling home a planet-sized pay packet , often for merely keeping his own company 's performance in line with the stock market 's .
And the fattest pay packets often occur at companies where `` downsizing '' is most vicious .
Can it be long before populists such as Pat Buchanan begin to tap directly into these resentments , before politicians say that `` something must be done '' to rein back American capitalism ?
Of course , public policy can do sensible things , as well as crass destructive ones , to address fears that America 's less fortunate are being left behind .
But on this occasion we will not dwell on the rights and wrongs of welfare reform , education reform , tax reform and the rest .
We simply pose the question , what might America 's rich themselves do to assuage the anxieties and resentments of the unrich ?
Once upon a time , philanthropy was the answer .
Americans still give generously , especially compared with mean Europeans .
But there are signs that the tradition is flagging , particularly near the top .
By one count , eight in ten Americans earning more than $ 1 million a year leave nothing to charity in their wills .
By any measure , the new billionaires of Silicon Valley and Wall Street pale alongside the robber barons .
John D. Rockefeller started giving away his money when he was a clerk in Cleveland ; by the end of his life he had handed over $ 550 million , around $ 6 billion at today 's prices .
The barons also had a sense of purpose .
Nowadays , when cash is given , it is often thrown away on things like renaming business schools .
Philanthropy needs the bright ideas of the new corporate leaders as much as it needs their cash .
In such a market-driven place as America , there is always a chance that a problem can heal itself .
The pattern of future growth may , relatively speaking , favor today 's low-income groups more than the better-off .
The conspicuous excesses of capitalism may likewise be curbed : shareholders may clamp down on silly executive pay .
Downsizing is going out of fashion .
Also , many of the new rich are young ; they will become more philanthropic in their dotage .
On the other side stand the lesson of history ( even the robber barons ' generosity did not avert a backlash ) and the fact that few of the new rich seem to be aware that they are doing anything questionable at all .
This conviction sometimes reflects the products they make .
A software designer is a creative type , an artist almost _ hardly an exploiter , like somebody who builds a railway .
But it also reflects two tenets of modern American business .
The first is the perception that a businessman 's value to society lies solely ( as opposed to chiefly ) in being a good businessman , in starting companies and making better products .
Medical and law schools teach the value of pro bono work , business schools rarely do .
The more dangerous second idea is the notion that America 's rich owe their wealth entirely to their own brilliance , when in fact they also owe much of it to the system that allows and encourages great wealth to be created .
Philanthropy is part of the unspoken contract that underpins the American dream .
If that contract is broken , a backlash is likely .
Every American , rich and poor , would lose .
