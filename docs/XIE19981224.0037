News Analysis : Financial Crisis Offers Challenge for China 's Shipbuilding Business ( 2 )
In fact , no big changes have been noticed in the global demand for new ships .
Global sales volume is expected to reach 45 million tons , still higher than the annual average between 1993 and 1996 , though lower than the record of 58.3 million tons in 1997 , said Cao Yousheng , an expert from the Ministry of Communications .
The CSSC predicts that the demand for new vessels will still be at a high level with China adding a further 120 vessels to its overall fleet in the next four years ; with a total five million tonnage at an estimated value of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars .
In particular large bulk carriers are most urgently needed .
With problems afflicting the exchange rates of the Japanese and ROK 's currencies , the two countries ' shipbuilders will have no choice but to end their low price tactics which will hike up the cost of shipbuilding globally .
As a result China should be able to regain its competitive stance in the world 's shipping market .
But for the present , China should try and prevent any excessive losses of domestic orders , said Xu Penghang , general manager of the CSSC .
" Efforts should also be made to improve basic shipbuilding facilities and further modernize the industry , to prepare for another possible shipbuilding peak following the ending of the financial crisis , " he added .
China 's shipbuilding capacity now ranks 3rd in the world , but lags too far behind Japan and the ROK .
However , the country built 2.29 million tons of vessels last year , up 20.5 percent from the previous year .
