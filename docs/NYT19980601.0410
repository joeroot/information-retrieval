49 ERS ' RICE WORKS ON HIS KNEE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By JEFFRI CHADIHA c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Rice won n't be doing much this week besides ensuring his knee is progressing back to full strength .
The wide receiver for the San Francisco 49 ers has been working out regularly and underwent a minor operation earlier last month to remove screws from his damaged left knee .
The screws , which had been placed inside the knee to facilitate healing after his second operation , were taken out because of irritation within the joint .
Rice , who injured the knee twice last season and played in only two games , is expected to be at full strength when training camp begins in July .
As expected , coach Steve Mariucci won n't have him involved in too many drills this time of year .
`` Jerry 's doing well , but he 'll be very limited , '' Mariucci said .
The 49 ers ' final minicamp will run through Thursday .
Mariucci also held camps in March and April .
`` The purpose of this minicamp is two-fold , '' Mariucci said .
`` We 're trying to progress with certain situations we haven n't practiced yet _ short-yardage , goal line , nickel and dime _ so when we come to training camp it will be review .
And we 're going to continue to evaluate our rookies . ''
One area Mariucci and his staff will be watching closely , as they have since the offseason began , is offensive tackle .
Frank Pollack , the team 's only proven reserve at the position , recently underwent surgery to repair a disk in his back and won n't be able to practice until late July at the earliest .
He suffered the injury during a workout , and it 's similar to a problem he endured during the 1992 season .
He spent that year on injured reserve .
Pollack 's injury leaves the 49 ers with two experienced tackles for this camp _ starters Derrick Deese and Jamie Brown .
There 's little behind those two .
Former starting right tackle Kirk Scrafford retired earlier this offseason after struggling with a bulging disk in his neck .
Former tackle Harris Barton , who missed all of last season with a bad knee , is expected to play guard this season .
As a result , two untested tackles , Dave Fiore and rookie Tom Ruhman , can expect a fair amount of evaluation during this minicamp .
Joining Pollack on the sidelines for this camp will be free safety Merton Hanks , who still is recovering from surgery to repair a torn chest muscle .
He 's expected to be ready for training camp .
Mariucci also is pleased with the progress that defensive end Gabe Wilkins is making with his rehabilitation from knee surgery .
Wilkins ' knee has been a question mark since he signed a five-year , $ 20 million free-agent deal in February , and he won n't return until mid-August .
However , it has helped make veteran defensive Chris Doleman a happier player .
Doleman recently signed a new deal and has been assured a chance to compete for a starting job .
His future with the team appeared all but over when Wilkins joined the 49 ers .
