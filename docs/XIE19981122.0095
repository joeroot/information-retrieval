NAIROBI , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Tobacco companies in Kenya will soon have to comply with a tougher regulatory legislation , Attorney-General Amos Wako has warned .
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health , new laws will soon come out to monitor and regulate the presence of harmful constituents contained in tobacco products , Wako was quoted by Sunday 's Daily Nation as saying .
Under the laws , " the government intends to go beyond merely carrying the warning that ' Smoking is harmful to your health , ' it will now require provision of a list of the harmful constituents contained or generated in the smoke of the product and their respective quantities , " Wako said on Saturday .
The upcoming legislation will also regulate marketing and advertizing of tobacco products and prohibit smoking in cinemas , theaters , public transport , hospitals and other specified buildings , he added .
