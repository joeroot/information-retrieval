STOCKS SOAR AFTER U.S. AND JAPAN AID YEN

NEW YORK _ The stock market staged a powerful rally Wednesday after the United States and Japan bought yen to bolster the sagging currency , whose fall has threatened to plunge Asia into a deeper economic crisis .
Worries that financial instability in Japan and Southeast Asia would result in a global slowdown this year that would cut even deeper into the already slumping profits of American companies had punished share prices for the last few weeks .
But investors stampeded back into the market after the U.S. government and the Bank of Japan moved to bolster the value of the Japanese yen , partly in the hope of preventing a deeper economic and currency crisis in Japan and the rest of Asia .
After plunging more than 207 points , or 2.3 percent , Monday on fears of a widening crisis in Asia , enthusiastic buying sent the Dow Jones industrial average soaring 164.17 points , or 1.89 percent , to close at 8 , 829.46 .
Scores of companies that had been battered by a huge wave of selloffs recently roared back to life in one of the heaviest trading days of the year with more than 744 million shares changing hands .
While a wide majority of stocks gained , technology and blue-chip issues led the recovery .
`` The market had been going down because of Japan _ Japan was the new wrinkle in Southeast Asia , '' said Byron Wien , the U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter .
`` But now it looks like there 's intervention and that Japan 's going to deal with its problems , and that is a clear positive for the markets . ''
In fact , the government 's decision to buy Japanese yen with dollars , coupled with promises that Japanese officials would address the deepening banking crisis there , helped lift the value of the Japanese currency , which had fallen close to an eight-year low on Monday at 146.15 yen to the dollar .
Wednesday , the value of the yen reached 136.37 .
Bond prices , however , plummeted after rising sharply in the last week on the prospect that Asia 's economic slowdown would benefit bondholders by dragging down commodity prices and helping stave off inflationary pressure .
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , rose to 5.73 Wednesday from 5.65 on Tuesday .
For investors , though , Wednesday 's events were not a clear indication that corporate profits , which are expected to be hurt in the coming year by a strong dollar and falling demand in Asia , are no longer in jeopardy .
`` The Asia problem is clearly not going to go away easily , '' said Edward Yardeni , chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell .
`` Investors would like to believe it 's going to go away , but it 's already clearly had an impact on earnings . ''
Indeed , in the last few weeks several large multinational companies , including IBM , 3 M and Motorola , have warned that the Asian economic crisis would depress earnings growth this year .
Although the economy continues to grow at a robust pace , with few signs of inflation , slowing profit growth in the first quarter of the year and worries that Asia 's festering crisis would pinch profits even more led to a sharp selloff beginning in mid-April , after the Dow peaked at 9 , 211.84 .
But Wednesday , investors helped ignite the Dow , which soared as much as 230 points before a late wave of selling pushed the index lower .
The Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500-stock index rose 19.52 , or 1.79 percent , to 1 , 107.11 , and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.33 percent , to 1 , 776.40 .
Oil stocks gained after the price of oil soared on reports that the leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would move to establish more oil production cuts .
And , tobacco stocks , which rose modestly Wednesday , may rise higher Thursday because the Senate voted to reject a tobacco bill aimed at curbing smoking .
To prolong the rally , however , analysts say that Japanese officials are going to have to do much more than commit to banking reform and stimulus packages .
`` This is potentially a watershed event for the financial crisis , '' said Jeffrey Applegate , the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers .
`` However , the real economy in Japan is still going down .
But what was crucial for the markets was to see a policy response .
And that 's what you 're seeing now . ''
Wien of Morgan Stanley added that a big selloff may yet come later this year if things don n't change , at home and in Asia .
The rally , he said , was simply an indication that things were looking better .
`` This is a rally on the promise Japan will do something , '' he said .
`` So we 'll have to see what Japan does , and then assess whether it 's enough . ''
