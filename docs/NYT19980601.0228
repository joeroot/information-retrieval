WORLD CUP GIVES VITALITY TO INDUSTRIAL CITY

SAINT-DENIS , France _ The huge metal ring shimmers and gleams in the middle distance , like a gigantic alien spacecraft looming at the edge of town .
The ring is pierced by 18 steel masts , and cables from atop each mast hold the ring aloft above 80,000 seats .
Struts at the edge of the ring moor it to the Earth .
Otherwise , it would sail away .
If the new Stade de France looks like a hybrid of flying saucer and clipper ship , the image is apt .
The main stadium for the 1998 World Cup of Soccer will bring the eyes of the world to this hard-working industrial town of 92,000 at the northern edge of Paris .
When Saint-Denis welcomes the world to the tournament 's opening match on June 10 , the world will find itself already there .
The streets teem with immigrants and their children , many from North Africa and Central Africa , some from Asia and Eastern Europe , most of them poor or working-class .
About a fifth of the people of Saint-Denis were not born in France .
Saint-Denis has a long history , and it has figured prominently in the making and remaking of the French identity .
The Saint-Denis Basilica , in whose basement archaeologists are uncovering foundation stones from the early Middle Ages , was the birthplace of Gothic architecture in the 12th century and , for more than 1,000 years , the burial place of French kings .
Their bodies were tossed into a ditch during the Revolution and were reburied with honor during the reign of Napoleon .
But it was the Industrial Revolution that made Saint-Denis what it is today .
The construction of a canal feeding into the Seine in 1834 , and the arrival of the railroad in 1843 , brought a heavy concentration of manufacturing to La Plaine , a previously undeveloped area between Paris and then-rural Saint-Denis .
La Plaine now constitutes the southern half of Saint-Denis and is home to numerous audio-visual , research and manufacturing industries , including the plant where France 's high-speed rail cars are built .
With industrialization came immigration and leftist politics .
In 1892 , Saint-Denis elected its first Socialist mayor .
During the student uprisings of 1968 , leftist faculty bolted the Sorbonne and established a new university in Saint-Denis , now the University of Paris VIII with about 27,000 students .
The city 's left-leaning , working-class , multicultural tradition took physical form when the badly decayed town center was redeveloped starting in the early 1970s .
About 80 percent of the buildings near the basilica had to be destroyed .
`` Saint-Denis wanted the town center not to be for the rich , '' said my guide , Caroline zum Kolk , although there was little chance of that outcome in any event .
`` They decided most of the new buildings should be social housing , and to preserve the old street system from the Middle Ages . ''
The architectural results were variable , ranging from grim brutalist concrete boxes to rather more cheery interpretations of North African traditions , by a variety of French and international architects .
Oscar Niemeyer , the architect of the basilica , chimed in with an elegant wave of reflective glass for the offices of the newspaper L ' Humanite .
The plan was an excellent example of urban planning , even if not all the buildings are memorable or well-maintained .
Narrow passages between buildings , echoes of the medieval town , lead to a wider but still intimate pedestrian mall bisected by a street .
At one end of this space is the crisp modernist City Hall annex , designed by Henri Gaudin , and the entrance to the subway station is near the other end .
All around are street-level shops with public housing , offices and a hotel above .
The largest single project incorporates a parking garage , a supermarket and several levels of oddly angled and terraced public housing in which no two units are identical .
When the French government chose a site in Saint-Denis for a new stadium to accommodate the 1998 World Cup , city officials saw the project as an opportunity for further redevelopment .
The site , at the northern end of La Plaine and just outside what had been the wall of the historic town , was ideally situated to spur new development .
Saint-Denis applied its brand of entrepreneurial socialism to make sure the project met its potential .
The town 's Communist deputy mayor ( now the mayor ) , Patrick Braouezec , was appointed co-chair of the regional organizational committee for the World Cup .
He was able to use the city 's acceptance of the stadium project as leverage to obtain infrastructure improvements , jobs and housing .
The bargain brought Saint-Denis two commuter rail lines , an expanded subway station , improved highway connections and a linear park over a portion of an expressway that sliced through La Plaine .
The construction phase included a job training program and guarantees to use local subcontractors .
Development of a new neighborhood is promised near the stadium after the World Cup , and adjacent land already has been commercially developed with Europe 's largest sporting goods store and a multiscreen cinema .
The town also expects economic gain from the visitors the stadium brings , both for the World Cup and for other events throughout the year .
Because the stadium has only 6,000 parking spaces , most visitors will come by public transit .
Both the subway and commuter rail lines will leave stadium visitors close to the restaurants , bars and shops of Saint-Denis .
Saint-Denis also is using the arts and culture as tourism draws .
The annual Saint-Denis Festival coincides with the World Cup this year .
For traditional sight-seeing , Saint-Denis has a true gem in its basilica .
The carved stone images of centuries of royals form an eerie supine congregation in the ruggedly beautiful space .
The taller of the original spires has been lost , but the building remains a fascinating document of a crucial moment in architectural history .
It 's far more interesting than Notre Dame in Paris , and here you don n't have to stand in line for an hour to get inside .
There 's also a small but worthy Museum of Art and History , created from a former convent ; the Christofle Museum , at the site of the famous silversmith factory ; and a traditional market , in a late 19th - century shed just off the town center .
But the beauty of Saint-Denis is not so much in its buildings as in its human culture _ the liveliness of its shopping streets , its mixed population , the sound of a local variant of rap music pouncing through an open window .
Zum Kolk says , with a tinge of both pride and defiance , that Saint-Denis seems to presage a new France whose multicultural vitality is full of promise .
