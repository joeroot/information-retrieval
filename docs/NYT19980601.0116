& UR ; NAKED & LR ;
By David Sedaris .
Back Bay / Little , Brown , $ 12.95 .
This funny , venomous and at times sad collection of 17 autobiographical essays focuses on the author 's many bizarre experiences , like a week at a nudist trailer park , as well as on his family , particularly his witty , acerbic mother .
`` Even the bleakest of them contain stuff you shouldn n't read with your mouth full , '' Craig Seligman wrote here in 1997 .
& UR ; THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS & LR ;
By Arundhati Roy .
Harper Perennial , $ 13 .
A 31-year-old woman returns to her formerly elegant home in southern India to be reunited with her haunted twin brother , whom she hasn n't seen since a calamitous event drove them apart and blighted their lives almost 25 years earlier .
Part political fable , part psychological drama , part fairy tale , this first novel is a devastating meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family .
The quality of Roy 's narration `` is so extraordinary _ at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple _ that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish , '' Alice Truax said in the Book Review last year .
& UR ; THE TROUBLE WITH PROSPERITY - A CONTRARIAN 'S TALE OF BOOM , BUST , AND SPECULATION & LR ;
By James Grant .
Times Business / Random House , $ 15 .
A chronic bear warns that Americans are far too smitten with the stock market , and with an eye toward past economic cycles , he argues that what goes up must come down .
The result is `` a witty and informative '' book , John Rothchild wrote here in 1996 .
In & UR ; THE BIG TEN : THE BIG EMERGING MARKETS AND HOW THEY WILL CHANGE OUR LIVES & LR ; ( Basic Books , $ 14 ) , Jeffrey Garten , a former top trade policy adviser to Clinton , argues that 10 countries _ ranging from India to Turkey _ are rapidly becoming major forces in the world economy .
Last year , our reviewer , Alan Tonelson , said that even if the power of these nations is exaggerated , the book `` is a welcome ...
corrective '' to the administration 's Pollyanna-ish views .
The moguls behind today 's global communications empires are the focus of & UR ; THE HIGHWAYMEN : WARRIORS OF THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY & LR ; , by Ken Auletta ( Harvest / Harcourt Brace , $ 13 ) .
The author of this collection of 17 profiles , which has been updated and features a new chapter on Microsoft , `` is a superb reporter and seems happiest explicating the nuts and bolts of a company , '' Judith Newman said here in 1997 .
& UR ; LIFE WITHOUT WATER & LR ;
By Nancy Peacock .
Bantam , $ 10.95 .
A young girl named Cedar , growing up on a primitive commune in North Carolina , describes how she and her mother survived the false utopias of the '60s , and in the process digs deep beneath the peace and love platitudes of the time .
In 1996 , our reviewer , Francine Prose , called this a `` deft , sly , unassuming first novel . ''
& UR ; ALVIN AILEY : A LIFE IN DANCE & LR ;
By Jennifer Dunning .
Da Capo , $ 16.95 .
This unflinching portrait of the brilliant but deeply tormented choreographer is also a study of black dance in America during much of the century and a social history of the turbulent theatrical world of the 1960s , '70s , and '80s .
The author , a dance critic for The New York Times , has written a `` compassionate and painstakingly reported biography , '' Mindy Aloff wrote here in 1996 .
The same publisher has issued another profile of a legendary dancer and choreographer , & UR ; ALL HIS JAZZ : THE LIFE & AMP ; DEATH OF BOB FOSSE & LR ; , by Martin Gottfried ( $ 16.95 ) .
The outsize figure that emerges here was furiously driven and immensely gifted in both dance and filmmaking but was also tormented by depression and self-loathing .
`` The cardinal virtue '' of this account is the author 's `` intimacy with the show-business scene that was Fosse 's chrysalis , '' Ronald Bryden said in the Book Review in 1990 .
& UR ; THE BOUNTY & LR ;
By Derek Walcott .
Noonday / Farrar , Straus & AMP ; Giroux , $ 12 .
This volume of poetry ranges from an elegy on the poet 's mother to fresh visits to such old haunts as New England , Europe , and his home island , St. Lucia .
While generally unimpressed with the author 's longer works , William Logan said here last year that `` Walcott is a master of ...
easy , careless abundance '' and admired `` the stunned eloquence of his lines . ''
The same publisher has issued another retrospective volume by a major poet , & UR ; HISTORY OF MY HEART & LR ; , by Robert Pinsky ( $ 12 ) , which includes portraits of the author 's family and boyhood neighbors , among others .
`` Pinsky has a rare gift ...
for action , character and atmosphere clearly and buoyantly proportioned , '' R.W .
Flint wrote in these pages in 1984 .
& UR ; THE CLUB DUMAS & LR ;
By Arturo Prez-Reverte .
Translated by Sonia Soto .
Vintage International , $ 13 .
Lucas Corso , a cynical Spanish mercenary specializing in hunting down rare books , gets into trouble when he agrees to authenticate both a missing chapter of `` The Three Musketeers '' and a 17th - century manual for summoning the Devil .
The result is an `` intelligent and delightful novel , '' Margot Livesey said here last year .
& UR ; DON ' T ERASE ME : STORIES & LR ;
By Carolyn Ferrell .
Mariner / Houghton Mifflin , $ 12 .
The eight tales in this debut collection focus on urban young people , describing , for example , the survival techniques of a homosexual black teen-ager , and a woman 's path to becoming HIV positive .
`` It 's intimate in the way you used to hope a good book could be , '' our reviewer , Katharine Whitemore , wrote in 1997 .
