JETS GET FINE-PRONE COX TO REPLACE JONES
( ATTN : Ill. , Fla. ) ( mk ) By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ The volatile Bryan Cox , a three-time Pro Bowl performer who has spent $ 100,000 on fines in his career , agreed to a contract with the New York Jets Saturday that would make him the middle linebacker in place of the injured Marvin Jones .
Coach Bill Parcells acknowledged Cox 's stormy past _ in a game last year for the Bears , he drew consecutive 15-yard penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct _ but said : `` I 've been lucky with veterans .
O.J .
Anderson , Everson Walls .
They just want to know what you want . ''
The move came with the swiftness that has marked Parcells ' regime when faced with a problem .
Jones , the team 's leading tackler last year , suffered a freakish injury during a Friday practice session when an unidentified teammate tripped over another player and landed on Jones .
Jones tore two ligaments in his left knee and will be lost for the year .
Behind him , the Jets had no one who could be counted on in the same way .
The backups are 34-year-old Pepper Johnson , returning from quadriceps surgery , and the journeyman Dwayne Gordon .
Cox was cut two months ago by the Bears , who had tired of his criticism of the team 's management .
Even some of Cox 's teammates were angered by his emotional outbursts on the field .
Cox will be reunited with one of them , safety Anthony Marshall , with the Jets .
It was Marshall who said after Cox 's consecutive penalties in the Bears ' loss to Tampa Bay : `` There 's no need for that , none at all .
We 're out here to win football games , not to put on a show for the cameras . ''
Marshall had left practice and was not available for comment Saturday .
Cox signed a four-year , $ 13.5 million deal in 1996 with the Bears following five outstanding seasons in Miami .
He had 34 1 / 2 sacks for the Dolphins , including 14 in 1992 .
In 25 games with the Bears he got only eight , but he did produce 232 tackles .
The decline in the sack total is not particularly alarming to the Jets because in Parcells ' scheme the middle linebacker is not expected to be a critical pass-rusher .
The Jets rely more on outside linebackers for that purpose .
Also , the team is switching its defensive front alignment to the 4 - 3 , which counts on the middle linebacker to stop the run .
The 30-year-old Cox had announced last winter that he expected the Bears to release him , and he was right .
In his two seasons with the team he was fined several times , including $ 10,000 in the season 's opener against Green Bay , when he threw a helmet .
He was known for his temper when he played with the Dolphins as well , once creating headlines when he made an obscene gesture to Bills fans in Buffalo .
At Chicago , the Bears used a rotating system of captains , but he refused the honor one week when it was his turn .
Still , if there is one coach in football who understands linebackers , it is Parcells .
He was the man , after all , whose Giants defense was anchored by Lawrence Taylor .
Also , Parcells and Cox share a bond : horse racing .
Parcells used to own several thoroughbreds in partnership with Mike Francesa , the radio and television personality .
`` Brian owns horses , '' Parcells explained , `` and I used to see him in the winter at Gulfstream . ''
`` Brian and I are going to talk .
I know he 's a good kid . ''

Parcells said he spoke to Cox twice on Friday night .
He also knows his talent .
He has been coaching against him for some time .
Asked about his volatility , Parcells said : `` Maybe you need a little fire around here .
It might help us . ''
Quarterback Glenn Foley said of the move , `` I heard he 's a good locker-room guy .
Real intense .
He 'll have a lot of work to do when he gets here .
The defensive schemes are pretty difficult . ''
Reining in his emotions may be more of a chore for him , though .
EXTRA POINTS :
Glenn Foley looked considerably sharper in the club 's second scrimmage of training camp .
After completing barely half his passes in the team 's first scrimmage on Wednesday , he connected on 12 of 14 attempts for 102 yards in Saturday 's scrimmage .
He also found Keyshawn Johnson for a 7-yard touchdown pass and produced points on a 42-yard John Hall field goal .
Vinny Testaverde , who had outshined Foley in the first scrimmage , was 8-of-15 for 97 yards with no scores .
But Hall did complete one of Testaverde 's drives with a 34-yard field goal ...
Johnson made a key sideline grab in traffic , one of the skills he has been attempting to improve on .
Rookie Jason Fabini shared right tackle with the veteran Siupeli Malamala , and it is likely the fourth-round draft pick is on his way to becoming the starter ...
Jerald Sowell had a nice 30-yard catch and run from his fullback spot ...
Curtis Martin , who missed six days with a hamstring injury before returning Friday , was held out of the scrimmage .
The entire team is off on Sunday .
`` It 's been a long 10 days , '' Parcells said of the nonstop camp .
