Iran Completes Deployment for Grand Maneuver
TEHRAN , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Iran announced on Sunday that the army has completed its largest logistics , land and air personnel deployment operations for the grand maneuver on the eastern border with Afghanistan .
Deputy commander of the ground forces Brigadier General Hassan Barati told the official news agency IRNA that the logistics , armored and reinforcement units from 10 provinces across the country arrived in the Zoulfaqar-2 maneuver operational zone within 72 hours .
In order to evaluate the logistic capacity of the forces , railroad facilities were not used for transportation and deployment of the troops , Barati said .
He said all the required facilities including water , foodstuffs , fuel , ammunition , tanks , and helicopter gun-ships have been brought to the region .
The Iranian army announced to launch its biggest maneuver with 200,000 troops on the eastern border with Afghanistan following the escalation of tension between Iran and the Afghan Taliban militia over the killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter in Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month .
Commander of the army 's ground forces Abdolali Pourshasb said on September 12 that 40 percent of the 200,000 troops had been deployed along the eastern border during the past month .
The week-long maneuver is to be carried out in an area of 5,000 square kilometers in the northeastern province of Khorasan and the southeastern provinces of Sistan and Baluchestan .
The maneuver is said to start by the end of September .
However , Iranian officials refused to give the exact dates .
It will be the second grand maneuver on Iran 's eastern border this month .
On September 1 , the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) launched a ground-breaking maneuver with participation of 70,000 troops in Khorasan province and deployed the troops and equipment involved in the maneuver in the border area .
Despite the massive military deployment , the moderate Iranian government has expressed the hope to solve the problem with the Taliban through peaceful diplomatic means .
