NBA , Union to Resume Talk on Friday
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The full bargaining committees of the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association will sit down at the bargaining table Friday for the first time in 23 days , the two sides agreed yesterday after a two-hour meeting among three representatives of each side .
" It was agreed we have nothing to lose by meeting , and we mutually decided to meet Friday , " NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a telephone interview .
" We 're not near anything .
But you can n't get anyplace unless you meet .
We owe it to a lot of people to try to have another meeting . "
On the 140th day of a lockout of the league 's more than 400 players , Stern also said that the signing period for the league 's 200 free agents , followed by abbreviated training camps , will not begin until a complete collective bargaining agreement is signed .
A source familiar with Stern 's thinking said such a scenario indicates that the season would not begin until January , even if a deal were reached by Thanksgiving .
It likely would take 10 to 14 days for a labor contract to be ready for signatures if no hitches developed .
Union sources were not available to comment immediately on yesterday 's developments , which followed the first conversation between Stern and NBA players union executive director Billy Hunter in 11 days .
Last Friday , Jeffrey Kessler , the union 's outside counsel , called Jeffrey Kessler , the union 's outside counsel , called Jeffrey Mishkin , the league 's chief legal officer , and they mutually agreed it " would be futile " to resume talks , Krssler said .
Team owners , union officials and players have said recently they are willing to sit out the season rather than give in to the other side 's demands and accept " an unfair deal . "
There are a number of unresolved economic issues , including how much of league revenue the players will share .
The players received 57.1 percent of the revenue last season , and the league wants to reduce it to 50 percent .
The union is seeking 60 percent and wants owners to assume s ome risk if the agreed-upon amount is exceeded .
