Will U.S. Be Drawn Into War on Rebels ?
Administration officials have played down fears that the United States is being drawn deeper into Colombia 's guerrilla war .
The Pentagon recently said it would tighten safeguards meant to keep aid from going to forces involved in human-rights abuses , and promised new scrutiny of the `` joint combined exchange training '' in particular .
Under an agreement signed in August , Colombian military units can receive U.S. support only after their rosters have been screened to determine that they do not harbor troops known to have violated human rights with impunity .
Officials said only two battalions of the Colombian army have qualified so far , and both of those have had to be assembled from other forces .
Another key condition cited by U.S. Embassy officials is that U.S. aid can only be used in a designated region of Colombia where the ties between drug producers and the guerrillas are held to be so close that any rebel unit could be fairly considered the traffickers ' ally .
There was no question that the definition of the zone was broad : `` the box , '' as it was described by U.S. diplomats , encompassed almost the southern half of the country .
Yet officials said the area was not big enough for the Pentagon , which has quietly refused to acknowledge its limits .
`` In terms of geography , the use of the resources , I 'm personally not aware of any restrictions , '' Wilhelm said .
So far , administration policies on Colombia have received nothing like the scrutiny given U.S. policies for Central America in the 1980s , and aid conditions have often been only loosely applied .
For instance , the Colombian military was required to pledge in writing that it would use the six Blackhawk helicopters it bought in 1996 largely for anti-drug operations with the national police .
But U.S. officials said they knew of no such operations since the helicopters arrived in early 1997 .
The administration has since been fighting congressional demands that it give three more Blackhawks directly to the police .
Some policy analysts question the new alarm about Colombia because they say the drug threat itself is overblown .
The quality of Colombian-grown coca is so low , they argue , that it can not offset the declines in cultivation in Peru .
Intelligence analysts also raise questions about the rebel-trafficker alliance that has been at the core of policy-makers ' concern .
According to a 1996 report by intelligence and law-enforcement agencies , the rebels ' ties to the drug trade are extensive .
But a declassified summary of the report says that while guerrilla fronts sell protection `` in virtually all departments where traffickers operate , '' only a few rebel fronts `` probably are involved more directly in localized , small-scale drug cultivation and processing . ''
Officials said there was a consensus among the U.S. intelligence agencies that the insurgents ' role in the drug trade had not grown or changed substantially since the report was issued .
A FARC spokesman who uses the alias Leonardo Garcia contended that the rebels did not protect coca fields to make money so much as to defend peasants with whom they are allied .
`` The idea is simply to label us as delinquents , to reject us as people with a political struggle , '' the spokesman said in an interview in New York .
`` It 's a way to legitimize a military intervention . ''
There is little question that the evolving U.S. policy has focused less on the close relationship that Colombian traffickers have with many right-wing paramilitary groups .
The problem of such apparent partisanship , critics of the policy argue , is that it may get in the way of the settlement that U.S. officials say they would like to help bring about .
After the kidnappings of several U.S. citizens by the guerrillas , Washington refused to deal with the insurgents at all .
And while the rebels recently announced their willingness to negotiate with a new president , they have also threatened to attack U.S. military personnel .
Although Colombian history has demonstrated that it is easier to talk peace than to produce it , political pressure for an end to the war clearly has grown .
`` We 're talking about land reform , about dealing with oil policy , about constitutional reforms , '' said the head of the government 's peace commission , Daniel Garcia Pena .
`` Today , people understand that these social and political questions the guerrillas raised have to be put on the table . ''
