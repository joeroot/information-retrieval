MUD ROUTE GETS FIRST STAKES WIN
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By KEVIN MODESTI c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
INGLEWOOD , Calif. _ Mud Route won The Californian on Sunday and lost his claim to fame .
Until he surged to the lead on the turn for home at Hollywood Park and held off Deputy Commander by two lengths , he was the best horse who 'd never won a stakes race .
Mud Route , ridden and trained by Hall of Famers Chris McCarron and Ron McAnally , was an early West Coast favorite for the 1997 Kentucky Derby after swift maiden and allowance victories _ but shin problems sidelined him until fall .
At Santa Anita this winter , the colt twice finished second to ' 97 Derby winner Silver Charm .
His reputation preceded him to Arkansas , where he was favored in the Oaklawn Handicap but ran fourth .
A confidence-building victory against cheaper horses last time out set him up for The Californian , a $ 250,000 race whose 45 winners include 10 national champions .
Mud Route ( $ 3.80 ) , once a speedball , stalked Worldly Ways for most of the 1 [ - mile race .
Deputy Commander , trying to find his Travers - and Super Derby-winning form and carrying six pounds more than the field , came wide and finished 2 { lengths in front of third-place Worldly Ways .
`` Right now , I 'm not sure if he can beat Silver Charm , '' McAnally said of Mud Route , `` but at least he 's won a stake . ''
Next is the June 28 Hollywood Gold Cup , where the question will be if he can beat Gentlemen and Skip Away , and the popular answer will be `` no. ''
Also expected for that $ 1 million race are Malek , Puerto Madero , Behrens , Bagshot and Deputy Commander .
No Californian winner has captured the Gold Cup since Cutlass Reality 10 years ago .
This was the slowest Californian ( 1 : 48 ) since Another Review 's in ' 92 .
Mud Route has won five of 11 starts and more than $ 460,000 for Janis Whitham .
And finally , his resume includes black type .
Later Sunday , McCarron and McAnally teamed up again to win the $ 150,000 Estrapade Stakes on the turf with late-running Proud Fillie ( $ 5.40 ) .
