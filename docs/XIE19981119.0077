Bogus Jockey Handed 10-year Ban
LONDON , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- American jockey Angel Monserrate has been banned for ten years by England 's Jockey Club after riding in races as an amateur under a bogus identity .
He rode professionally in the USA until he was banned in 1995 after failing a drugs test , but turned up in England under the name ' Angel Jacobs ' .
According to the BBC on Thursday , Monserrate took part in 21 races in England , partnering five winners , but attracted suspicion because of his riding style .
His licence was withdrawn in August and his mounts have been disqualifed , with compensation paid to the owners of horses who missed out on prize money because of his deception .
The ten-year ban was handed out at a meeting of the Jockey Club 's disciplinary committee , who charged him with misleading stewards and acting in a manner prejudicial to the integrity of racing .
Monserrate , who now works in a Cambridge restaraunt , told the committee he did it " for the love of racing " .
He confirmed afterwards that he would not appeal against the ban .
