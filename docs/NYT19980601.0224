LEARN TO WALK ...
ALL OVER AGAIN
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By CAROL BIDWELL c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES _ & UR ; & LR ; Walking .
Putting one foot in front of the other .
It 's one of those basics , like learning not to shove peas up your nose or put gum in your hair , that we all learned as babies .
There we were , crawling across the carpet and using the edge of the coffee table to pull ourselves upright .
Suddenly one day , we let go .
Hey , ma , I 'm walkin ' !
In an instant , we were independent , upright human beings able to toddle , then run , leaving our frantic parents scrambling behind us .
When we fell , we got up again and walked bravely into the rest of our lives .
As teens , guys perfected that I 'm - so-cool slouch , and girls developed the ingenue sashay , leading with their hips like runway fashion models and sexy young movie stars .
As adults , we learned to ambulate with a baby perched on one hip , a heavy purse thrown over one shoulder , weighed down by schoolbooks or an overweight briefcase , lugging bags of groceries or boxes of tools .
And all those things , Sherry Brourman says , is why we walk funny .
And why our backs , our knees , our shoulders , our ankles hurt .
`` Everybody 's in pain , '' said the West Los Angeles physical therapist , who has written a book , `` Walk Yourself Well , '' on how to walk properly _ and be pain-free .
`` Walking the way you 're supposed to is the answer to that pain . ''
When you get right down to it , it 's probably an evolutionary miracle that we 're able to hold ourselves upright in the first place .
`` We 're probably genetically programmed to crawl , '' Brourman said .
`` You 're holding this strange bag of bones up against gravity . ''
To add to the problem , human feet are put together wrong , with our ankles and legs attached just above our heels .
For perfect posture , our ankles would be attached in the middle of our feet , which would make our shoes look really funny , but would help us balance better .
The tendency to walk unsymmetrically and unbalanced starts early , said Brourman .
`` We come into the world with pretty sound bodies .
But when we 're babies , we 're sponges .
We 're watching the person we worship the most _ mom , dad .
By the time they 're 6 months old , toddlers pick up mom 's gait , big time . ''
A walk `` is literally as distinctive as a face , '' said Brourman , a Boston University graduate .
Think Marilyn Monroe , with her rolling hips and an undulating rear that one observer once said looked like `` two puppies wrestling under a blanket . ''
Think John Wayne , with that sidewinder-style meander that told the bad guy he was in for trouble .
By the time we 're 30 or 40 or 50 , our distinctive gait is probably taking its toll on our joints .
For example , visualize a perfectly constructed , perfectly balanced robot walking .
Everything works just fine .
Then a screw falls out of an ankle , and the ankle becomes wobbly .
Over weeks or months , the ankle gets so wobbly , it causes strain in the knee , then the hip , then the back .
Eventually , you 've got a robot looking for a good chiropractor or orthopedist .
Or at least a tube of Ben-Gay and an aspirin .
The human body works the same way , affirms Dr. Clifford Kahn , an Encino orthopedic surgeon affiliated with Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center .
`` It 's the old foot-bone-connected-to-the-leg-bone thing , '' he said .
`` The mechanics of it extends throughout the body . ''
He , too , is an advocate of proper body alignment and proper walking techniques , especially with patients who 've just undergone foot , leg or back surgery and who are learning to walk again .
`` If you use proper body mechanics _ proper walking techniques and proper posture _ body problems can certainly improve , '' Kahn said .
But convincing patients that they need to change their walk often brings hesitancy and skepticism , said Brourman .
`` They look as me and say , ` But I 've been walking this way for 57 or whatever years . ' Then they do it my way _ and they can see the difference immediately . ''
While patients are usually pleased that they 're pain-free , they may not be totally happy .
`` The guys usually tell me I 'm taking the ` cool ' out of their walk , '' Brourman said with a laugh .
`` Women tell me it looks too masculine .
Men tell me it looks swishy . ''
Although Brourman 's book includes a detailed test to evaluate your walk and diagnose problems , often all she needs to do is watch a person sit , stand and walk to start them on the road to recovery .
One patient , for instance , came for help for a bad back .
But the real problem , she determined , was that he was nearly deaf and leaned forward to hear .
At the same time , he had glasses that slid down his nose , so he always sat or walked with his neck crooked and his head elevated to keep his glasses in place .
When he got his glasses fixed , a hearing aid and a few lessons on how to keep his body aligned , his back problems ceased .
`` You get people to try changing their walk , and they feel the difference and they get this amazed look on their faces , '' she said .
But what about all that charm-school stuff about walking around with a book on your head ?
It doesn n't work , she says : `` You can walk with the book on your head and have your body inappropriately balanced . ''
And forget that head-up , shoulders-back , chest-out , stomach-in , butt-in military posture rookies and plebes have been taught for centuries .
`` It forces you to lean back , and you have to bring your head and your shoulders forward to balance yourself or you 'd be falling on your butt all the time .
It 's bad for you . ''
So how do you know if you 're walking right ?
Think of yourself like a puppet , Brourman suggests .
Visualize a string coming out of the top of your head , pulling it toward the ceiling .
Visualize two more strings attached to your shoulders , pulling them toward the floor .
With head and shoulders in line , the rest will usually follow .
But what about people with arthritic joints , slipped discs or other skeletal problems ?
If the muscles are strong and the body is in alignment , uncushioned joints won n't rub together and hurt , Brourman said .
Lower back pain ?
Stand up straight and lift your rib cage one inch .
You should feel less pressure on your back _ and less pain .
And don n't forget , she admonishes , that strong stomach muscles can take a lot of pressure off aching back muscles .
`` There are people who say to me , ` You mean I have to use my stomach muscles all the time ? ' Yes , you have to use your stomach muscles all the time .
But look at it as exercise for your belly and a lot of other muscles .
Look at it this way : You can walk to the bathroom and be getting in 18 steps of exercise while you do it . ''
