U.S. Government Waives Sanctions Against Colombia
WASHINGTON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The Clinton administration has decided to waive two-year-old sanctions against Colombia , citing success made by the country in fighting narcotics , U.S. officials said Thursday .
Waiver of the sanctions means that there will be fewer impediments to U.S. assistance to Colombia 's anti-drug efforts .
Colombia also will be spared economic penalties for the coming year .
The decision will be announced on the occasion that the State Department releases a report in the afternoon on the anti-narcotics efforts of 30 countries excluding the United States itself .
U.S. administration officials said that most of the 30 were expected to be " certified " as fully cooperating with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts .
However , the administration is not certifying Colombia as fully cooperating because officials believe that country 's anti-narcotics effort faces serious shortcomings , the officials said .
The officials said Colombia will remain in the " decertified " category .
They added that the decision to waive the sanctions was based partly on the emergence of the Colombian national police as a highly effective counter-narcotics force .
For the past two years , Colombia has been ineligible for all U.S. assistance except for humanitarian and counter-narcotics aid .
The certification process , first required by Congress in 1986 , is widely criticized by many countries , where it is seen as counterproductive .
Noting that the certification process is a kind of interference in their domestic affairs , the countries say the root cause of the drug problem is insatiable U.S. demand .
