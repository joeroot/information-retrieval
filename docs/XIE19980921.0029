Freed Hostages Held in Chechnya Leave for Home
MOSCOW , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- British ex-hostages Camilla Carr and Jon James , who were freed from Chechen captors earlier Sunday , left for home on a special chartered flight , the Itar-Tass news agency reported .
The kidnappers released the two after realizing that it was impossible to get paid for the hostages , Tass quoted British Ambassador to Moscow Andrew Wood as saying .
Russian officials , Chechen leaders , Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev have helped the liberation of Carr and James , Tass said .
Carr and James came to Grozny , capital of the Russian Chechnya republic , in June 1997 to help Chechen children recover from post-war syndrome .
They were held since July 3 and kept in as many as 14 places in more than a year of captivity .
Carr and James 's plane is heading for Britain 's Bryans-Norton military airfield , Tass said .
