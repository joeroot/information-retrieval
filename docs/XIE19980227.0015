Chirac Rejects Strike Without Warning Against Iraq
PARIS , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- French President Jacques Chirac has rejected the idea of launching an automatic military strike against Iraq if it fails to honour the U.N . - Iraq weapons inspection agreement signed Monday .
" Automatization ( of a military strike ) is not acceptable , " Chirac said Thursday in the daily newspaper Le Monde .
" We think a military strike is a very serious gesture and it is justified , as it would be made in the name of the international community , that the U.N. Security Council make a debate on it , " he said .
He also warned Iraq of " the most severe consequences " if it fails to observe its agreement with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan .
" All options would be possible " if a violation of the agreement is observed , the French president said .
Chirac said he would write another letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urging him to respect his deal with the U.N.
" I would tell him that all options remain open and possible , notably the lifting of the sanctions and the re-integration of Iraq into the international community , but that supposes that he plays the game , " he said .
He described the military build-up by the United States in the Gulf and the diplomatic efforts by France as two sides of one coin which had the same object of achieving a peaceful solution .
" We have never had a dispute with President Clinton .
In the end , we used two different means , but we had both of us the intention to arrive at a peaceful conclusion , " said Chirac .
He said that without the U.S. military build-up in the Gulf , diplomatic efforts alone would not have allowed the U.N. Secretary-General 's mission to succeed .
