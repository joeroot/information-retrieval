SHARP CONTRASTS EMERGE IN TWO NEW JERSEY RACES
( ja ) By IVER PETERSON c.1998 N.Y .

TRENTON , N.J .
_ New Jersey 's primary elections on Tuesday have hardly roused much excitement among the voters _ the state expects a minimal turnout _ but the contestants in the two congressional races that have attracted the most attention at least give voters a choice in contrasts .
In the Fifth District , taking in most of Bergen County and the state 's northern suburbs , Rep. Marge Roukema , the state 's senior member of Congress , is not expected to have too much trouble surviving a challenge from Assemblyman Scott Garrett , 38 , in the district 's Republican contest .
Yet Garrett 's ardent positions against abortion and in favor of gun owners ' rights are issues that draw voters on primary days .
Ms. Roukema , 68 , with 18 years in Congress , styles herself as a fiscal conservative but is more of a centrist on social issues .
The winner in the Fifth District will run against Mike Schneider , a former television newsman , who is unopposed for the Democratic nomination .
Besides most of Bergen County , the Fifth District takes in parts of Passaic and Sussex counties , Garrett 's base .
And in the 12th District , covering the emerging suburbs of central New Jersey from Princeton in Mercer County up into Hunterdon County , Rush Holt , a physicist and university administrator , is the Democratic party favorite , with his name on the party line on the ballot .
He is running against the personal fortune and aggressive campaign style of Carl Mayer , a former Princeton Township Council member .
The winner will face the Republican incumbent , Rep. Michael Pappas , who is in his first term and deemed beatable by the state Democratic Party .
Holt , 49 , is emphasizing what he calls `` kitchen table '' concerns like the quality of education and the health of Social Security .
Mayer has loaned more than $ 600,000 to his campaign and is running as a maverick outsider championing causes like cutting electric rates and closing corporate tax loopholes .
Those were the kinds of issues Mayer , 39 , cut his teeth on as a young volunteer for Ralph Nader , and Nader showed his support in a campaign appearance last month .
Besides the congressional races , there are numerous local and municipal primary contests .
The polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. in the state 's 4,000 polling places .
Of New Jersey 's 4.5 million registered voters , 25 percent are registered Democrats and 19 percent are registered Republicans , but any unaffiliated voter may register in either party at the polls on Tuesday and vote in that party 's primary .
Joe Britt , director of the Division of Elections , said the state expected a turnout of just 12 percent .
