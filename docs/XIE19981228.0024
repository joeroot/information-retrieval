Gullit Steps up Player Search
LONDON , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit could begin the New Year with a multi-million pound spending spree .
He has been linked with moves for fellow Dutchman Ronald de Boer , former England international Steve Stone and French defender Didier Domi .
It follows the collapse of the proposed 5.2 million pounds purchase of AC Milan winger Ibrahim Ba , after a long-standing knee problem was revealed by his medical .
Gullit has refused to name names , but expects to complete at least one deal in the near future .
He said : " Something good is happening .
I can n't say yet but we have made a breakthrough in the transfer market .
" I 've worked hard this week and agreed a fee for a player .
I hope I 'll be able to announce something very soon , but it is now down to a medical . "
De Boer was a member of the Dutch squad which reached the World Cup semi-finals in the summer , but he and twin brother Frank were involved in a stand-off with Ajax Amsterdam over the club 's refusal to allow them to move to Spain .
Nottingham Forest midfielder Stone is a native of the north-east , having been born at nearby Gateshead .
Gullit is reportedly willing to pay 5 m for him , an offer which Forest counterpart Dave Bassett may be willing to accept to finance team-strengthening plans of his own .
Full-back Domi currently plays for Paris St Germain but a 3 m deal is thought to be close to completion .
