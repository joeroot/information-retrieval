" Cultural Revolution " Relics Draw Wide Attention ( 2 )
The company which conducted the auction also claimed not to know that the painting was a cultural relic , and relics departments raised no objection at the auction .
Over the past few days , Chinese media , including the Chinese Central Television ( CCTV ) , have reported the quarrel over the copyright of the painting , raising the question of how to deal with relics of the " cultural revolution " .
According to Chinese law , important cultural relics may not be sold .
An official from the State Cultural Relics Bureau said that his department will take resolute measures to implement the law on cultural relics protection .
The Construction Bank of China has indicated that it will comply with the decisions made by related departments .
Experts said that , as a result of the unpleasant memories that many Chinese people have about that decade of " cultural revolution , " relics have not been well protected , and many have been destroyed .
Objects that have witnessed significant historic events , such as the first national flag flying over the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) , should also be regarded as cultural relics , according to the experts .
They added that it is urgent to make laws and regulations on the authentication and protection of relics of the " cultural revolution " .
" Those who lived through it can not bear to look back on that ` decade of turmoil ' .
But our offspring have the right to know and understand the special historical period through the relics , " said an expert .
