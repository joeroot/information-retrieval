Ecuador 's Banana Exports Drop
QUITO , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Ecuador 's banana exports in the first 10 months this year dropped 20 percent from the same period of last year , according to data released Saturday by an exporting company , Rey Banano del Pacifico .
Banana exports between January and October dropped to 2.81 million tons from 3.47 million tons in the same period of 1997 , and 3.04 million tons in 1996 .
The data show that after the good spell of the 1996 - 1997 period , when sales grew by 14 percent , the 1998 figures were the lowest of the last three years .
The plunge was caused not only by the slack demand of the Asian and Russian markets , but also because of lower banana production due to the " El Nino " weather phenomenon .
