Malaysia 's Ruling Party Youth Chief Detained
KUALA LUMPUR , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Malaysia 's ruling United Malays National Organization ( UMNO ) Youth chief Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and four leaders of the Islamic Youth Movement of Malaysia ( IYMM ) were arrested Monday under the Internal Security Act , police said .
Zahid was picked up by police in Kota Kinabalu , Sabah , East Malaysia , Monday morning , Director of the Criminal Investigation Department Yaacob Mohamed Amin told reporters .
The four IYMM leaders -- president Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman , deputy president Mukhtar Redhuan , secretary-general Shaharuddin Badaruddin and vice president Abdul Halim Ismail -- were arrested at the IYMM headquarters here , Yaacob said .
All were detained under the Internal Security Act for threatening national security .
Yaacob said they were identified as " henchmen " of sacked Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim to carry out acts prejudicial to public order .
Anwar himself was detained at his house here Sunday night and police later said he had also been detained for threatening national security .
The arrest of Anwar came hours after he led a huge rally at the National Mosque here in another protest of his removal from his cabinet posts on September 2 and expulsion from the UMNO of which he was deputy president after being implicated in allegations of sexual misconduct .
A group of his supporters later made their way without Anwar to the Putra World Trade Center where the UMNO headquarters is located and created a disturbance causing some damage to property .
And then they marched to the official residence here of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad where police prevented their advance by using water cannons and tear gas .
A statement issued Monday by Public Relations Superintendent Ghazali Haji Md Amin of the Federal Police Headquarters here said Anwar 's arrest was in connection with the disturbances caused by his supporters on the afternoon of September 20 , 1998 when " illegal assemblies and rioting " took place threatening internal security and public order , and causing damage to public property and disruption to traffic .
After his dismissal , Anwar launched what he termed as a " reformation movement " and addressed a series of public rallies in the country .
