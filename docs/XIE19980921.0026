Israelis Celebrate Jewish New Year Amid Tight
JERUSALEM , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Israelis celebrated the beginning of the Jewish new year Sunday evening as thousands of police and security forces are on high alert to prevent possible terror attacks .
It is like an ordinary Shabbat , which is the Jewish weekend and a day of rest .
Family members gather at home , religious people go to pray in synagogues , and the secular people play music and drive on the streets as usual .
But there is an air of excitement in every Jewish home .
Mother lights the candles and recites blessings , family members eat sweet food wishing everyone else a good and sweet year .
There are more people in synagogues than Shabbats .
Israeli police and security forces , however , could not enjoy their vacation on Rosh Hashana , or the beginning of the new year , this time .
They were deployed on crowed areas in big cities and checkpoints in Gaza and the West Bank in an effort to foil any possible terror attacks which the Palestinian resistance movement , Hamas , has threatened to stage .
Gaza and the West Bank would remain totally closed until the Jewish new year ends Tuesday night , and the Palestinians are allowed to cross the checkpoints only in cases of emergency .
The closure , which was imposed more than one week ago after Hamas threatened to avenge the killing of two of its military leaders by Israeli soldiers , was briefly eased last week .
After Hamas renewed its threats to kidnap Israeli soldiers and blow up car bombs in big cities , the Israeli army sealed off Gaza and the West Bank again Friday .
Israeli security forces were on high alert nationwide .
More than 100 Palestinians have been injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank since the death of Adel and Imad Awadallah brothers .
When Israelis say " Shana Tova " , good new year , to each others , they probably wish for a new year in which they will see fewer conflicts and will no longer live under terror threats .
