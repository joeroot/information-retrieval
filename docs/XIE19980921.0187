India 's CPCB to Take Steps to Control Pollution
NEW DELHI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- India 's Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) is expected to take new steps for all major ports to check marine pollution at the country 's coast , official sources said here Monday .
This move followed observations by CPCB that several ports were found directly or indirectly responsible for marine pollution .
State pollution control boards have also been asked by CPCB to submit a time-bound action plan against this type of pollution .
Annually about 1,600 billion cubic meters of waste-laden upland waters are discharged through the rivers into the coastal area .
The marine environment in coastal areas is being subjected to pressure from both land-based and offshore activities since three of the four largest metros are situated on the coast , besides 11 major ports and 140 intermediate and minor ports in the country , the sources said .
Moreover , over 5,000 million cubic meters of domestic sewerage containing decomposable organic objects together with community waste water find their way into the sea every year .
This is in addition to an estimated 1,000 million cubic meters of waste waters from industries and farms .
Besides , solid wastes like heavy metals , pesticides , complex organic compounds and other industrial effluents are also dumped into the sea .
The central authority , which supervises the Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System , has also decided to take up a comprehensive program on coastal action plan aimed at assessing pollution from different sources , their pathways and time-bound long - term programs to curb them .
