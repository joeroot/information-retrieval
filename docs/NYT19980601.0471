U.S. OFFICIAL SCOLDS JAPAN ON ECONOMY
( ATTN : Russia , China ) ( mk ) By TIMOTHY L. O ' BRIEN c.1998 N.Y .

VIENNA , Austria _ Chiding Japan for not addressing its economic problems more adroitly and voicing strong support for the International Monetary Fund , Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warned Monday that problems in Russia and China had the potential to spread elsewhere .
In a speech to banking executives at the International Monetary Conference here , Summers said the health and direction of the Japanese economy were important factors in the recovery of Southeast Asia and scolded Japan and its banks for not acting more boldly to help revive the nation 's sagging fortunes .
The Japanese economy has deteriorated in recent months , he said , particularly in the banking sector , with an estimated $ 600 billion to $ 1 trillion in bad loans on its books .
Summers lauded Japan 's attempts to stimulate its economy , but asked the country and the banks to do more and to do it faster .
`` Going forward it will be important to ensure that future fiscal policies are consistent with long-lasting domestic demand-led growth , '' Summers said .
`` But it will also be vital to address in a more determined manner the financial sector . ''
Summers was at odds with Japanese bankers , who said sufficient steps had been taken to resolve the problems .
`` There is too much pessimism about the international competitiveness of Japanese banks , '' said Toru Hashimoto , chairman of Fuji Bank Ltd. `` Many major banks have taken bold steps to improve their financial health by writing off , directly or indirectly , enormous amounts of nonperforming loans at the end of March this year .
Profit levels are now expected to recover steadily , and I believe they will regain their competitiveness within the next three years . ''
Summers said that the IMF was an indispensable tool for helping to resolve international financial instability of the sort that has recently threatened to swamp countries like Indonesia and Russia .
In particular , he said that Russia is under `` serious strain , '' warning that `` Russia 's trouble in turn has the potential to become central Europe 's , and the world 's . ''
Markets on Russia 's periphery have been buffeted as the rouble and the Russian stock market have fallen in recent weeks .
In Poland , for example , the all-share Warsaw Stock Index fell 4.1 percent Monday , continuing a sharp drop under way for the last couple weeks , sparked largely by Russia 's financial problems .
In Tallinn , the stock market fell 15.78 percent last week , echoing similar declines elsewhere in the Baltics and eastern and central Euope .
Meanwhile , China 's internal economic problems , as well as the plight of its neighbors in Asia , have put pressure on the yuan .
But he said that it is crucial that China continue to act as a `` firebreak gainst the possibility of another cycle of competitive devaluation in Asia . ''
In no uncertain terms , Summers said that continued funding of the IMF was crucial and that the White House would do everything in its power to make sure the agency 's role as a lender of last resort was not undermined .
`` Not to support the IMF at this point in time is like canceling one 's life insurance policy when one has already gotten sick , '' Summers said .
`` It 's not a risk we should take .
And let me be clear : It 's not a risk this administration plans to take . ''

Summers also called for greater disclosure by banks about their exposure to derivatives , newfangled financial products which derive their value from the performance of underlying assets such as stocks , bonds or currencies .
He said that it was difficult to get satisfactory information on U.S. banks ' derivatives positions last winter when the Asian economic crisis appeared to be spinning out of control .
Summers advocated continued international support for emerging markets in Asia , Latin America and Eastern Europe , but cautioned that lending must occur in an environment where every country has established rigorous accounting procedures , greater oversight of borrowers and easy access to financial information .
