ANOTHER REASON TO WORRY
( For release Wednesday June 3 ) By DAVID GRIMES Sarasota ( Fla. ) Herald-Tribune c.1998 N.Y .

A group of Little League moms were discussing the chores their kids did .
One mother said her son made his bed every morning , folded laundry and cut the grass .
Another said her son prepared his own breakfast , vacuumed the rugs , updated the family 's Web page on the Internet and rotated the tires on the car .
I was pretty dizzy by the time the third mom spoke , but I think she said her 12-year-old son had recently re-marcited the pool , performed an emergency appendectomy on the family cat and restructured their stock portfolio , but that he was `` not perfect '' and sometimes needed to be reminded to pick up his socks .
As if the heat , the dust and the hard bleacher seats were not enough .
As if I don n't have anything better to do than eat stale popcorn , sip watery Mountain Dews and shout `` good eye ! ''
whenever a batter refrains from swinging at a pitch that is 10 feet over his head .
As if all of this were not enough , I now have to deal with the possibility that my son may be `` chore deficient . ''
Until I overheard the Little League moms , I didn n't realize that one could be deficient in chores , just as one could be deficient in vitamin A , vitamin C or thiamine .
The symptoms of chore deficiency were not spelled out by the moms ( and I was much too ashamed to ask ) , but one can assume they include listlessness , lassitude , ennui and , in the later stages , chronic `` South Park '' viewing interrupted by long periods of staring morosely into the refrigerator .
If I had thought about it , which of course I hadn n't , I would have guessed that our 12-year-old was well within the normal range of chore performance .
On good days , for example , we only have to tell him 18 times to pick his clothes up off the floor and my wife says she recalls a time he walked the dog without being threatened , though I personally think she 's confusing our son with someone she saw on TV .
But now I know that , compared to the ultra-choring kids of the Little League moms , our son is severely chore-deficient to the point that we should be glad he gets out of bed at all , let alone at noon .
The Little League moms did not tell me , and again I did not ask , what the ramifications are of chore deficiency .
For example , will it affect his chances of getting into a good college ?
Will the dean of admissions deduct points because he failed to empty the dishwasher when he was 12 ?
Will a future employer ( assuming there are any ) deny him promotion because of his history of sloppy towel-hanging ?
If it is true that doing chores builds character , is the reverse also true ?
Are our prisons bulging with people who , as children , failed to regularly take out the trash ?
It would be interesting to ask successful people about the kind and number of chores they performed as children , assuming you could count on them to tell the truth , which you probably couldn n't .
I say this because I suspect ( as well as hope ) that adults exaggerate the number of chores they did as children to the point that you wonder how they had time to go to school , so busy were they chopping wood , plowing fields and just generally thumbing their snotty little noses at the child labor laws .
It would probably be more useful to ask the parents of successful people how many chores their kids did , assuming , after all the sordid stories we 've heard about him so far , that we really want to know that Bill Clinton had to be told twice to pick up his socks .
