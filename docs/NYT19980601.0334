GLOBE CRITICS RATE FILMS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) c.1998 The Boston Globe !
poor , ! !
fair , ! ! !
good , ! ! ! !
excellent ! !
1 / 2 `` Full Speed '' An occasionally engaging film about a group of young people in a Paris suburb and what happens when one of them , a talented writer , finds widespread success .
The film 's biggest fault is failing to flesh out the writer 's character so that his transition into a heel is sharper and the effect on his friends more poignant .
( Unrated ) ( Renee Graham )
& QL ; & QL ; & UR ; ! ! !
`` Home Before Dark '' & LR ; Modestly scaled but insightful and affecting take on an 11-year-old girl forced into assuming adult responsibilities when her depressed mother attempts suicide and is institutionalized .
Impressive central performance by Stephanie Castellarin in a sterling debut film by Maureen Foley .
( Unrated )
& QL ; & QL ; & UR ; !
1 / 2 `` Hope Floats '' & LR ; Hope flops as this film never gets off the ground .
It wastes the sweet appeal of Sandra Bullock in a skeletal and predictable story about a woman retreating to her Texas hometown in pain and confusion after being dumped by an unfaithful husband .
The movie mopes around more than she does .
( PG-13 )
& UR ; !
`` I Got the Hook-Up '' & LR ; This is ghetto comedy as its most crude .
Rapper Master P , who wrote and stars in this offensive mess , fancies his film about two criminals and stolen cell phones is a screwball comedy _ but only those foolish enough to pay to see this will feel screwed .
( R ) ( Renee Graham )
& QL ; & QL ; & UR ; ( FU ) ! ! !
1 / 2 `` The Last Days of Disco '' & LR ; The third and ( the filmmaker swears ) last in Whit Stillman 's set of three nightlife comedies about preppies who talk smart and live dumb while sorting out their lives and struggling to stay on the right side of cool .
Stillman makes canny use of the waning of the disco era and the end of the youth the characters are afraid of losing .
Witty , literate , great soundtrack .
( R )
& QL ; & QL ; & UR ; ! !
1 / 2 `` Lawn Dogs '' & LR ; Not unimaginative , but this attempt to blend social comment and children 's fantasy never quite coheres .
A 10-year-old girl flees her fenced-in Louisville suburb to enjoy an innocent but liberating friendship with a gardener her parents and their neighbors regard as white trash .
( Unrated )
& QL ; & QL ; & UR ; ! ! !
`` The North End '' & LR ; An invigorating debut film from the brother team of Frank and Joseph Ciota , filled with raw freshness , danger , atmosphere and a total avoidance of goombah cliche .
Fatalistic locals led by Frank Vincent take a dim view of the changes coming to their storied neighborhood and of the strains on its codes .
