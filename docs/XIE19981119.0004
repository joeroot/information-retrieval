EU Clears Strategy on Forestry Development
BRUSSELS , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- The European Union ( EU ) said Wednesday that it has adopted a strategy for its member states to promote sustainable development of forests .
The forestry strategy will contribute to the implementation of international commitments on the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , said the European Commission , the EU 's executive body .
The strategy , based on the multifunctional nature of the forests , puts particular emphasis on the major challenges facing European forestry , such as its contribution to overall economic and social development , and the protection of the environment , notably in relation to biodiversity and climate change , said the Commission .
Meanwhile , EU commissioner Franz Fischler stressed the importance of forestry , not only to the EU 's economy as a whole but , in particular to its rural areas .
Forest-based industries produce goods worth over 300 billion ECU ( about 280 billion U.S. dollars ) each year and provide jobs for over two million people , he said .
Many of the employees live in rural areas and a substantial percentage of those employed in forestry are also part-time farmers , he added .
The Commission would continue to help coordinate and complement policies and measures between EU member states , Fischler added .
