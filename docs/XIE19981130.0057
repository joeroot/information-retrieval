Macao Governor Values Macao 's Peculiarity
MACAO , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira said here on Monday that the government will continue to take effective measures in the coming year to retain Macao 's peculiar life style and status .
Expounding his policy and budget for 1999 at the local Legislative Assembly , the governor said that the peculiarity of Macao is of importance to both Macao residents and China 's foreign policy .
To maintain Macao 's peculiarity conforms to the mutual benefits of China and Portugal and is of equal value with the concept of " one country , two systems , " he said .
Tourism and gambling have been playing an important role in Macao , and the future Macao Special Administrative can still make use of the revenue from these sectors to promote local modernization , he noted .
Like other areas such as Monaco and Las Vegas which take tourism and gambling as their economic mainstay , the revenue from these sectors in Macao is a key to balancing the local budget , the governor said .
" We have been paying attention to maintaining these traditional sectors in Macao 's economy , and I believe that the future special administrative region will firmly carry out the practice , " he said .
The governor pointed out that Macao 's grassroots organizations have been showing vitality and taken an active part in cultural activities .
The government will surely take the responsibility of financing the activities of non-governmental bodies .
These activities are not held because of the financial support of the government , but they lie in the residents ' deep confidence in local social values .
The policy of localizing personnel and judicial system also acts as a guarantee for maintaining Macao 's special life style and status , the governor said .
The government will make great efforts to finance institutions of higher learning so as to enable them to nurture talented people for the future .
On the other hand , a sound legal system and clear interest protection system can attract business people to invest in Macao , the governor said .
