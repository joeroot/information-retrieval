U.S. Not Ready for Equal Ties with Iran : FM
TEHRAN , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said here on Sunday that the U.S. , a vowed foe for nearly two decades , is not ready to establish relations with Iran based on mutual respect and equality .
" Iran is sure that the relationship sought by the U.S. with Iran is based on U.S. domination , " Kharrazi told visiting Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Saad Mojber .
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency , Kharrazi said that on the other hand , Iran does not feel any need to establish relations with the United States .
The U.S. cut off ties with Iran after the 1979 take-over of U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian students following the Islamic revolution , and has accused Tehran of being a sponsor of international terrorism and been eager to contain it in every possible way .
Kharrazi 's remarks came after Iranian hardliners stirred up strong opposition to any links with Washington .
They have called for the impeachment of Kharrazi , criticizing the Foreign Ministry for issuing visas to 13 Americans to visit Iran .
The Americans were accused as spies and attacked by a group of hardliners in Tehran on November 21 .
Apparently unscathed , the Americans , said to be businessmen by the government , left Iran the next day .
Iranian government officials have vowed to punish the assailants , saying anyone entering Iran with a valid visa is entitled to the country 's protection of safety and security .
The hardliners , however , urged President Mohammad Khatami to punish those responsible for invited the Americans .
" If any American delegation visits Iran under any title , it will be more seriously dealt with , " the hardliners warned Friday .
A confrontation between moderates and hardliners , sparked by the incident , seemed unfolding .
Kharrazi said that Iran enjoys growing diplomatic relations with many other countries , which are revising their policies towards Tehran .
Referring to the relations between Iran and Libya , Kharrazi said Iran welcomes regular exchange of official visits between the two countries , adding that boosting bilateral relations will strengthen economic cooperation .
Mojber said Libya is willing to develop relations and exchange views on international issues with Iran .
