Hodgson Quits as Blackburn Hit Bottom
LONDON , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Roy Hodgson has parted company with Blackburn Rovers after the club hit rock bottom following a humiliating 2 - 0 defeat at the hands of relegation rivals Southampton in English Premier League on Saturday .
Hodgson wrote in his regular Saturday newspaper column only hours before the game : " The way a manager behaves in times of crisis can often be the decisive factor in determining whether a team pulls through or slides deeper into trouble . "
Rovers fans will hope his decision to quit will not be the decisive factor leading to their relegation .
The club , who won the championship only three years ago , have won only two of their 14 league games and conceded 22 goals this season .
Ironically , Hodgson had been touted as the next England manager and angry Blackburn fans were mockingly chanting " Hodgson for England " towards the end of game .
Hodgson failed to appear at the post-match press conference , and instead , chief executive John Williams announced that he had left the club .
A club statement said : " Following the run of recent poor results , Jack Walker and Roy Hodgson have agreed that Roy will be leaving the club .
" The club are disappointed at this outcome but feel the decision is inevitable and in the best interests of Blackburn Rovers . "
Hodgson was a surprise appointment in June 1997 as the club attempted to rebuild after they managed only 13th place under Ray Harford .
Not well-known in England , Hodgson was a much-respected coach on the continent .
He built his reputation in Sweden where he led Malmo to five consecutive titles , and then cut his international teeth with the Swiss national team , taking them to the 1994 World Cup and 1996 European championship finals .
That was enough to persuade Inter Milan to offer him one of the biggest jobs in the game , coach to one of the most prestigious clubs in Italy .
Although he took Inter to the UEFA Cup final , he was unable to mount a serious challenge to Juventus in the league and cut short his contract after just one season in charge .
He faced a difficult job at Blackburn , but after taking a while to settle in , he oversaw a late push that secured a UEFA Cup place and restored the faith of the locals .
At the same time he earned a reputation as a shrewd TV analyst and was mentioned as a possible future England manager .
He spent heavily to try to restore Blackburn 's fortunes , but some of his buys raised eyebrows among the Ewood Park fans .
Most notable was the purchase of Kevin Davies for 7.5 million pounds ( 12.46 million U.S. dollars ) from Southampton in the summer .
Davies has failed to score this season and with 2.5 million pounds ( 4.15 million U.S. dollars ) Martin Dahlin struggling with injury , Hodgson splashed out another 4.25 million pounds ( 7.06 mi llion U.S. dollars ) for Bolton 's Nathan Blake last month .
Although Blackburn were struggling in the league and went out of the UEFA Cup in the first round to Olympique Lyon , there was no indication that Hodgson was considering leaving .
" We 've had a bad start but our ambition is still to finish in the top six , " he said three weeks ago .
The league is tight and we should not abandon that ambition . "
He became the fifth premier league coach to leave his club this season after Liverpool 's Roy Evans , Tottenham Hotspur 's Christian Gross , Newcastle United 's Kenny Dalglish and Leeds United 's George Graham .
