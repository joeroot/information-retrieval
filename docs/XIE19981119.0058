Rawlings Stresses Importance of Primary Health
NAIROBI , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings Wednesday appealed to West African countries to lay emphasis on Primary Health Care to ensure good health for the majority of their people .
Building sophisticated health facilities would not make much impact because only a few people can afford to pay for such facilities , Rawlings said .
" Primary health care will have to be revived otherwise we will be wasting our time , diseases will multiply and we will be running a vicious cycle , " the President said when the top brass of the West Africa College of Physicians called on him at the Castle , Osu .
The physicians , led by Nigerian President of the college Samuel Kuku , are holding their 23rd annual general meeting in Accra under the theme " Adolescent Health " , a Ghana News Agency ( GNA ) story reaching here Wednesday said .
President Rawlings recalled the effectiveness of sanitary inspectors of old and said they contributed immensely to environmental sanitation , thus promoting primary health care .
He told the physicians that " you carry so much weight so you have to assist governments to enforce primary health care . "
Rawlings spoke about the exodus of doctors from developing countries and appealed to the senior ones who are staying behind to assist their governments to curb the exodus .
Kuku said the college had stepped up its training programs to churn out more personnel who can serve in all levels of the health delivery system .
