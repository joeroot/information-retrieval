A HINT OF LASTING PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By JOHN MONTAGUE and ELIZABETH WASSELL c.1998 Albany Times Union
BELFAST , Northern Ireland _ We arrived in Belfast a week before the peace referendum in Northern Ireland , for a ceremony lauding John as the first Ireland Professor of Poetry .
Always , coming into Belfast , one is struck by how small a battleground it is .
Just a few streets west of the city center , which resembles any bustling English town , lie the Unionist enclave Sandy Row , and the Nationalist Falls Road , literally side by side .
Barbed wire and bombed-out or dilapidated houses characterize both areas .
The only apparent difference between them is the murals adorning the sooty brick walls .
Along the Falls , one sees Che Guevera and other political crusaders , making it clear that the Catholic extremists regard themselves as freedom fighters , while the Protestant murals depict the defiant , blood-red hand of Ulster , and `` King Billy '' on his white horse few Unionists seem to know that King William of Orange was supported in his campaigns by the pope .
Belfast is a microcosm of the tensions racking the end of our century , the walls between the Shankill and Falls a miniature of the former Berlin Wall , its sectarian strife as hard to decipher as Algeria or Yugoslavia , the pastor Ian Paisley , with his gross historical simplifications , a Protestant version of the Ayatollahs .
But while religion has been a source of conflict in the North of Ireland , it has also provided a name and central symbol for the referendum which was passed last week : the Good Friday agreement .
This agreement will try to remedy the division of Ireland , which began with a famous event bearing another religious name , the Dublin Easter Rising of 1916 .
Arguments abound .
If there had been no Easter rising , would Ireland have achieved home rule after World War I?
After all , Ireland was united before 1921 , albeit under English rule , and a new independent structure might have evolved naturally .
However , the Unionists had already declared their opposition to home rule , which they feared would be `` Rome Rule . ''
To placate them , England gave them their own parliament in 1921 , which they were able to maintain through gerrymandering , or carving up electoral districts to sustain a false majority in the six northeastern counties which make up Northern Ireland .
But in the 1960s the oppressed Catholic minority finally rebelled , under the banner of civil rights .
We are in an unusual position to appraise the current changes , John who was recently named Ireland 's first poet laureate , and Elizabeth , his partner , a novelist who is published in Ireland but who was born in New York .
We had been working on a TV film on John 's home area in County Tyrone , ancient seat of the Kings of Ulster , and the yearning for peace was palpable .
John 's portrait was being painted by a staunch Unionist , a former commander of the Ulster Defence Regiment .
So it came as no surprise that mid-Ulster had one of the highest yes votes , nearly 90 percent .
But what about Protestant Belfast ?
While there , we ventured , somewhat apprehensively , into the Orange Lily Pub in Sandy Row , decorated with triumphal orange sashes , Union Jacks , and photos of the royal family .
When John produced a handful of change to buy our drinks , and the barmaid gazed down at Republic of Ireland coins emblazoned with harps and salmon , we realized we 'd been found out as southerners , and most likely Catholic .
( The different currencies , and the difficulty of making a phone call to someone on the same island , are two of the more absurd and annoying aspects of a divided Ireland . )
But the barmaid remained friendly , and Elizabeth began to speak to her neighbor at the bar , a middle-aged man staring morosely into his pint of Guinness .
He told her that his 5-year-old daughter had been killed by the Irish Republican Army , caught in cross-fire .
Afterward , his wife left him , because his face was an unbearable reminder of their dead child .
`` But I bear them no grudge , '' he said simply .
`` God has told us to forgive each other .
All this hatred and revenge is eating up our souls . ''
Last summer , we went to Feile na Pobail , or the People 's Festival , in the Catholic Clonnard section of Belfast .
Our guide , a cousin of Pete Hamill , was solicitous that we should get a `` right '' ( i.e.
Catholic ) taxi to the site , an enormous greensward close to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams ' house .
Also nearby was a cemetery full of tombstones bearing Republican emblems and hymns to fallen patriots , but with a few Protestants from less divided times as well .
Irish music blared through the loudspeakers , while families played and picnicked .
The only suggestion that this was different from any urban park on a sunny Sunday was the presence of vigilant stewards here and there , keeping a professional eye out for trouble .
Compared to other sections of the city , which were taut with fear , these festival grounds seemed relaxed and happy , as though , to quote the IRA slogan , their day had come .

And , indeed , the Catholic minority has been steadily growing , and Irish literature , legends , music , even films , have caught the imagination of the world , while Unionist culture seems to remain static .
So , even as long ago as last summer , long before the Good Friday agreement , something positive was in the air .
But will this cobbled agreement work ?
Or will it fall apart like the power-sharing executive of Sunningdale in 1974 , a collapse which led to bombs in Dublin and Birmingham , and the assassinations of Airey Neave and Lord Mountbatten ?
It is a bit like Lanty Hanlon 's famous dog , which went a bit of the way with everyone .
The Unionists have been given back their Stormont parliament , and an assurance that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without majority consent .
The Republicans should gain entrance to Stormont ( the castle that houses the Northern Irish parliament ) , and will have the sop of cross-border councils , much-disputed by Unionists .
This is ironic when one considers that the new euro-train can barrel down to Dublin from Belfast in an hour and a half , and that when one crosses the border by car there are few noticeable differences : same green mountainous landscape , same language , same faces .

A bird flying over Ireland would see only one small green island , and be unaware of the divisive lunacies of history .
Anyway , despite the resistance of Unionists , the border seems to be naturally dissolving , especially as all Europe moves toward unity .
But we must still hold our breaths .
The Orange marching season has begun , and there are still the Assembly Elections to the new Stormont , where the extreme Unionists will find themselves in a minority , for the first time .
And there is decommissioning : Sinn Fein maintains that what is important is that the guns are silent , but Unionists want to see them handed over , to which Gerry Adams ironically echoes the Unionist battle cry , `` No surrender ! ''
And there are the stubborn , splinter paramilitary groups on both sides , like the particularly vicious Loyal Volunteer Force , which killed several young Catholics during the cease-fire , as well as the Continuity IRA , the Republican IRA , and the `` Real '' IRA , all of which claim legitimacy .
Soon , the Orange drums will throb through Ulster .
Will the Orangemen , belligerent in their bowlers and sashes , try to force their way through the small Catholic enclave of Portadown , the Garvaghey Road , as before , declaring it their democratic right to march where they please , in their own province ?
The Unionists love to use the term democracy , but Ian Paisley has already declared that he does not recognize that the agreement was passed by a majority .
Couched in this assertion , but unspoken , is Paisley 's belief that a majority formed in part by Catholics is not a genuine majority at all , since Catholics shouldn n't be participating in politics in the first place , but should remain sub-citizens .
Recently , on Irish radio , a comedian was pretending to give Paisley an arithmetic lesson .
`` If you have one apple , and I have three apples , who has more apples ? ''
asked the comedian painstakingly .
The Paisley character thundered , `` I do , because your apples are Catholic apples ! ''
Perhaps this year , finally , things will ease .
The Protestant boycott of a Catholic church in Antrim , called Harryville , has been lifted , as opposed to last year , when Catholic churches were being burned .
John has expressed the tensions and fears which flare up every marching season in a poem _ `` Weeds '' _ that has become well-known in Ireland .
Although maybe this year the fields will be cleared , for a better harvest :
& LR ; & QL ;
March and counter-March
As jagged orange of whin ,
Thick rushy green begin
Again to overcome the fields .
Each year we try to scythe ,
Hack , or burn them down ,
Knowing full well that next Spring
Those same dumb stubborn
Roots will stir underground .
