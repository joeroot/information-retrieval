ECONOMIC BOOM ROBS CALIFORNIA ELECTION OF BIG ISSUE ( JT )
By RICHARD L. BERKE c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
LOS ANGELES _ The most striking thing about the primary election campaigns here , from the candidates ' debate to the deluge of 30-second television commercials and the speeches on the stump , was that the topic that dominated California politics for years rarely surfaced : the economy .
While Californians are savoring economic good times , the adjustment has been troublesome for many politicians who are struggling for something to talk about in the absence of ready-made , bread-and-butter issues that touch the lives of voters .
The challenge for candidates , here and around the country , is to adjust to an electorate that has been remarkably transformed _ and become unusually sedate .
Whatever the outcome in this state 's primary on Tuesday , the campaign here offers the first big snapshot of how candidates everywhere are trying to navigate the politics of prosperity .
With pocketbook appeals largely off the table , the issue of education _ which was entirely neglected four years ago _ came to the fore , not only in a ballot initiative that would essentially eliminate bilingual education , but also in a broader debate over how to improve California 's public schools .
Other close-to-home issues are also bubbling , like growth management and cutting the state 's vehicle licensing tax .
And the void is also being filled by personal attacks .
`` It 's a world of difference in terms of voter attitudes this year , '' said Mark Baldassare , senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California .
In the San Francisco area , for instance , Baldassare said his polling shows that voters are `` most satisfied '' with their jobs and `` most negative about traffic . ''
But aggravating as it can be , traffic is hardly weighty enough to drive the elections in the most populous state in the nation .
With California 's economy soaring _ and a state surplus projected at $ 4.4 billion _ the one time politicians sounded exercised about the subject was when they groused that unemployment was so low that there was a shortage of workers to collect signatures to put initiatives on the ballot .
`` You 're starting with an electorate here that isn n't that interested in politics , '' said Dan Schnur , a Republican political analyst in San Francisco .
`` But when things are going so well , it 's even harder to get them to engage .
We have a candidate for attorney general who , out of desperation , declared that one of her top priorities if elected is dealing with road rage . ''
It is not that candidates did not try to campaign on the economy .
But somehow , sparring over how best to spend a surplus , or how to grapple with worker shortages , did not make for as compelling a debate as campaigns past that featured bleak commercials of closed factory gates and long unemployment lines .
This is mostly good news for incumbents because challengers have had a particular problem in coming up with persuasive arguments to elect fresh leadership at a time when things are going so well .
But even for incumbents , the lack of economic turbulence has led them searching for other , equally powerful messages to connect with voters .
And many have found themselves dwelling more on the prosperous present rather than making a vigorous case for the future .
`` For the first time in 30 years , we passed a balanced budget with a heart , '' said Sen. Barbara Boxer , a Democrat seeking re-election , at a luncheon in San Francisco .
`` We invested in the new economy _ in high-tech and biotech .
We 've created 1 million , three-hundred thousand , new good-paying jobs in California . ''
Building up to her case for re-election , Boxer declared : `` America is back .
California is back .
And guess what ?
I want to go back to the Senate to make sure that America and California are the shining stars of the next century . ''
In the last major elections here , voters despaired about their lives and their jobs .
Four years ago , it seemed , every other word out of the contenders ' mouths was the economy and jobs ( more accurately , joblessness ) .
Everywhere she went , Kathleen Brown , the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor in 1994 , who challenged the incumbent , Gov. Pete Wilson , vowed , `` One million new jobs for California . '' The Democrats relentlessly mocked `` Pete Wilson 's economy . ''
Since then , 1.4 million jobs have been created in California .
Now , according to polling by the Public Policy Institute of California , 6 out of 10 voters in this state think the economy is in excellent or good shape , and many say their own finances have improved , and expect them to improve even more next year .
The economic turnabout helps explain why Wilson 's two-term tenure has barely been mentioned by Democrats during this campaign .
Some politicians , including Wilson , say voters now have the luxury of thinking about the long term .
`` In a time of prosperity , people can be concerned with other issues _ as now they are about education _ and rightly so , '' said Wilson , a Republican who in his re-election campaign four years ago devoted much of his time to staving off attacks about his stewardship of the economy .
`` When the economy is not good people have that deep concern about their own economic well-being and the incumbents can almost do no right .
`` And the converse is true , '' Wilson continued .
`` When it is performing well and producing not just jobs but prosperity , their confidence returns as consumers and they are inclined to be highly tolerant of the incumbents .
You saw that with Bush 's defeat in ' 92 and with Clinton 's re-election in ' 96 .
So one guy paid the penalty for a bad economy as an incumbent and the other guy enjoyed the benefits of a good one . ''

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
Because there is no longer a premium on candidates with economic know-how , the unflagging economy has posed a particular problem for two wealthy candidates here who have presented themselves as outsiders from the business world : Alfred Checchi , the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , and Darrell Issa , a car alarm entrepreneur who is seeking the Republican nomination to take on senator Boxer .
But by a margin of 59 percent to 24 percent , Baldassare explained , prospective voters are more inclined to favor candidates with experience in elective office .
It is a far cry from the presidential campaigns of Ross Perot , whose allure , besides bankrolling his own campaign , was his ability to appeal to voters as a no-nonsense business executive .
It is also a far cry from the general , anti-incumbent mood that roiled the politics of 1992 and 1994 , and produced an aversion to the status quo .
`` Everything but the weather seems to be going well , '' said Steven A. Merksamer , a lawyer in Sacramento who is active in Republican politics .
`` That 's not to say we can n't do better .
But people are afraid of serious change by untested people . ''
