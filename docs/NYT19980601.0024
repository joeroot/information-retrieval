REVOLUTION SCRAMBLE FOR TIE , LOSE SHOOTOUT
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By FRANK DELL ' APA c.1998 The Boston Globe
FOXBOROUGH _ Revolution coach Thomas Rongen continues to preach patience but his team continues to falter .
The Revolution scored a late goal to tie the score , 1 - 1 , against the New York-New Jersey MetroStars Sunday , but lost in the shootout to remain in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with 10 points in 11 games .
Even more discouraging for the Revolution is that they have held the lead for only three minutes of the last 450 played .
`` In the last few games we haven n't been able to take the lead and we have ended up scoring in a desperate fashion , '' Rongen said .
`` But we have enough firepower to be able to get the lead and hold onto it .
And this team will show it can win .
`` We have scored 19 goals , which is more than previous years .
And , with resilience , we are capable of scoring goals and we are capable of scoring early . ''
Last year , the Revolution 's Alberto Naveda scored a hat trick in a 3 - 1 victory over the MetroStars to give them 13 goals in 11 games .
But the Revolution had 17 points in the standings and seemed well-placed to qualify for the playoffs .
Now , the Revolution have improved their skill level and tactical awareness , even without players such as Jair ( broken ankle ) , and Mike Burns and Joe-Max Moore , who are heading to the World Cup .
But the intangibles that contribute to success appear to be missing .
They again fell behind , as Brian Kelly finished a quick strike started in the MetroStars ' half by Jim Rooney in the 69th minute .
Eduardo Hurtado touched Rooney 's pass from just over the halfway line on the left side , and Kelly ran onto it and poked a shot past Ian Feuer with the outside of his right foot .
The Revolution rallied desperately , and Raul Diaz Arce scored his seventh goal of the season , heading in a Ted Chronopoulos cross in the 84th minute .
In the shootout , Tony Meola saved Richard Goulooze 's final attempt as the MetroStars improved to 16 points , 5 ahead of fourth-place Miami .
Edwin Gorter provided entertaining touches as well as midfield direction in the first half .
But after Ivan McKinley was ejected for a deliberate handball to prevent a goal , Gorter moved into a sweeper position as the Revolution played with 10 men .
Gorter set up Janusz Michallik and Imad Baba for the best first-half chances .
But Meola aggressively dove at Michallik 's feet in the 12th minute , then blocked Baba 's point-blank volley and Dahir Mohammed 's rebound in the 35th minute .
The MetroStars took command late in the half .
Mohammed blocked a Paul Dougherty header on the line , then McKinley made a diving clearance of a Kelly shot in the 44th minute of a 50-minute half .
Referee Paul Tamberino signaled a penalty , and , after consulting with linesman Richard Eddy , red-carded McKinley .
This was McKinley 's second ejection and he will be suspended from the Revolution 's visit to Los Angeles June 7.
But the Revolution was rescued by Feuer , who dove low to his left to stop Giovanni Savarese 's penalty kick .
The Revolution made major adjustments in the second half .
Evans Wise replaced Michallik , who had been injured in a first-half collision with Feuer .
Within minutes , Wise nearly set up a goal .
He held possession for what seemed like hours on the left side , allowing Gorter to advance from a deep defensive position .
Then , Gorter curved a long drive toward the far upper corner , which Meola saved .
The Revolution switched from strictly zonal defense to man marking with Mohammed and Brian Dunseth .
The simpler system led to fewer miscommunications , but there were enough breakdowns to cause concern , even before McKinley departed .
`` I 'm happy with the performance of the defense , '' Rongen said .
`` Savarese and Hurtado didn n't get a shot on goal .
This was our best defensive effort in the last three or four games . ''
