British PM Pledges to Continue Welfare Reform
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday denied there would be a U-turn in welfare reform , saying single parents should be helped to get off benefits and into work .
Blair told ITN television in an interview that the goal of the reform was to help families with children and added it was essential that the budget address ways of making work pay .
" We believe it 's right that lone parents get the same benefits as couples do and we also believe it 's right that the additional money that we have is put into helping lone parents off benefit and into work , " he said .
Nearly 50 Labor MPs stood up last December against a cut in benefits for single parents , dealing a blow to Blair 's plan to overhaul Britain 's 50-year-old welfare system .
Blair is keen to limit the rise in Britain 's total welfare bill , now 164 billion U.S. dollars a year , but is thought to be reluctant to squeeze the middle classes , many of whom voted Labour for the first time last May .
So far the government has failed to give a clear line on whether it favors means-testing benefits such as child allowance which up to now have been paid to rich and poor alike .
