& UR ; YOKO AND HER SON REMEMBER THE DEAD & LR ;
& UR ; Yoko Ono & LR ; describes her relationship with & UR ; Linda McCartney & LR ; in the latest issue of Rolling Stone .
`` During the Beatles ' sessions , '' she writes , `` Linda and I quickly learned that our husbands were not all buddy-buddy .
John and Paul were both talented but very strong-willed people .
There was some tension there .
Linda and I left them alone .
But we didn n't go chummy-chummy , wink-wink , ` Aren n't they silly boys ? ' either .
We both stood by our men .
That was how we were . ''
After & UR ; John Lennon & LR ; 's death , Yoko and Linda talked from time to time .
`` We communicated in deeds more than in words .
When she was strong , I felt strong .
She took a sad song and made it better . ''
In a separate interview in the magazine , & UR ; Sean Lennon & LR ; , 22 , describes his childhood .
`` I wasn n't allowed to watch commercials .
I wasn n't allowed to eat refined sugar .
I wasn n't allowed to eat dairy .
I grew up completely macrobiotic .
The sweetest thing I had were these little dried fish , these Japanese fish .
That 's what he would give me as candy . ''
Lennon says his father `` definitely had a violent temper , '' and `` I think it was also hard for him to become a sensitive monogamist .
...
He was a macho pig in lots of ways , and he knew it .
I think his greatest accomplishment was recognizing that he was a macho a_ and trying to stop it . ''
Lennon says he 's friendly with & UR ; Harper Simon & LR ; , whose father , & UR ; Paul Simon & LR ; , `` is constantly showing him chords on the guitar .
It 's nice .
He 's lucky .
On another level , I think it 's made it hard for him , that his dad is constantly over his shoulder musically .
But that doesn n't mean that I don n't wish my dad was around .
Even if my dad had totally repressed me and not allowed me to play music at all , I would take that over him being gone . ''

& UR ; FLASH & LR ;
& UR ; & LR ; _ Election Day special : & UR ; Bill Pates & LR ; says the last time a Democrat not named Brown was elected governor of California was 60 years ago ( & UR ; Culbert Olson & LR ; in 1938 ) .
_ The latest issue of American Benefactor , a magazine about nonprofit organizations , includes a & UR ; Joan Chatfield-Taylor & LR ; story about the De Young museum 's plans and controversies .
The story is accompanied by a photograph of the now-closed Conservatory of Flowers , notes & UR ; Ted Weber Jr & LR ; . , along with a caption saying that `` the post-quake de Young '' is `` in shaky condition both inside and out . ''
_ Angry at country music stations for allegedly ignoring his music and that of older performers , & UR ; Johnny Cash & LR ; and American Recordings placed an ad in the March 14 issue of Billboard .
`` American Recordings and Johnny Cash would like to acknowledge the Nashville music establishment and country radio for your support , '' says the ad , which is reprinted in the June issue of Harper 's .
The picture is of Cash grimacing angrily and flipping a big ole country bird .

& UR ; WRITERS ' BLOCKS & LR ;
& UR ; & LR ; Novelist & UR ; John Fowles & LR ; , who is in his 70s , used a cane as he walked onstage at a City Arts & AMP ; Lectures event in San Francisco last week .
`` If anyone thinks I am drunk , '' he told the audience , `` I am . ''
Whereupon Fowles described some of the substances he 'd imbibed .
Understandably , some members of the audience whispered their displeasure .
But Fowles ' assertion wasn n't true .
`` He wasn n't drunk , '' said lecture producer & UR ; Sydney Goldstein .
& LR ; `` That 's what he wanted to say instead of admitting that he had suffered a serious stroke . ''
Interviewing & UR ; Bernard Malamud & LR ; 16 years ago , Personals was put off by his crustiness and demands to check on his quotes before the story was published .
It turned out that Malamud 's reason was the same as Fowles ' ; he didn n't want to admit that he 'd suffered a stroke .

& UR ; WHO SAID WHAT & LR ;
& UR ; & LR ; `` ( If ) I go to Victoria 's Secret in my local mall and buy 12 pairs of underpants , they won n't get me a discount .
They 'll be like , ` Hey , can you sign my catalog ?
And that 'll be $ 150 , please . ' ''
_ Victoria 's Secret model Rebecca Romijn complaining about tough rules at the company store , in the Cable Guide .
