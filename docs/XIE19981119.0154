Philippines to Strengthen Tax System
MANILA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The Philippines sets to strengthen the country 's taxation system by introducing the necessary corrections on the revenue law , senior official of the Department of Finance said Thursday .
Finance Assistant Secretary Gil Beltran told reporters that since the revenue code of the country was very old , his department was preparing a study on the necessary reform .
He added that the country 's taxation system was " no longer at par with the rest of the world . "
The study placed emphasis on the way of imposing taxes on the funds transfer conducted by financial institutions , Beltran said .
At the conclusion of the preparation for the new tax system , reform plan would be presented to the private sector for necessary consultations .
" I don n't think the Bankers Association of the Philippines and the other financial institutions will oppose the plan as this will even encourage more investments in the country , " Beltran said .
