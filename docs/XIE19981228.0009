50 Rebels Killed in North S. Leone
LAGOS , December 27 ( Xinhua ) -- About 50 rebels were killed Saturday by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG in the fighting for the control of Makeni town in north Sierra Leone .
The rebels were killed during ECOMOG 's bombing raids on rebels ' positions just outside Makeni , said a report reaching here Sunday .
An ECOMOG official in Freetown , capital of Sierra Leone , was quoted as saying Sunday that the peace-keepers were battling rebels holding on just outside Makeni , which is about 100 kilometers northeast of Freetown .
The rebels launched an offensive on Makeni Wednesday and once succeeded in entering part of the city .
The unidentified ECOMOG official said he expected ECOMOG planes to go into action again against the rebels who had regrouped at the Makeni Teachers College on the southeastern highway to Magburaka .
ECOMOG took control of most of Makeni Saturday after bombarding rebels ' positions , said the official .
But the report quoted the fleeing residents who arrived in Freetown Sunday as saying that peace-keeping troops had retaken the town from the rebels Saturday .
Most of the civilians in Makeni and the surrounding area have fled and communications links with Makeni have been cut , said the report .
The rebels , compromising forces loyal to the ousted military junta of Johnny Paul Koroma and those of the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , intensified their offensive on key Sierra Leonean cities including Freetown in recent weeks .
Their attacks have caused a panic in the small west African country , leading to the evacuation of their nationals by the U.S. and Britain .
The United Nations also evacuated part of its staff to neighboring Guinea .
RUF 's No. 2 leader Sam Rockarie said that the rebels wanted direct talks with the government and the immediate release of its detained leader Foday Sankoh , who has been sentenced to death in connection with the 1997 coup of Koroma .
Bockarie threatened that unless the government agreed to the rebels ' terms , the rebels would continue their offensive .
" We are going to march into Freetown on New Year 's Day ...
We have the will and the way , " he said .
President Kabbah has refused the rebels ' demand .
Foreign Ministers of west African countries are expected to meet in Cote d ' Ivoire Monday to discuss the escalating tension in Sierra Leone .
