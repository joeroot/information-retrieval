BILL STRIKING RELIGIOUS OPPRESSION SEEN AS HURTING U.S. ENTERPRISES
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By DAVID GOLDSTEIN c.
1998 Kansas City Star
WASHINGTON _ Religious conservatives won a victory in Congress last month , and Republicans on Capitol Hill were only too glad to give it to them .
By a wide margin , the House passed a bill to punish religious persecution abroad with economic retaliation .
But by quieting the rumblings on its right wing , the GOP upset another important friend _ corporate America .
The division over the religious persecution bill reflects continuing friction in the GOP 's base .
Some business leaders are unhappy that the party 's social and religious agenda has in several cases trumped its traditional business concerns .
`` A lot of American companies are kind of scratching their heads about this ` pro-business Republican Congress , ' '' said Willard Workman , vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , who deals with international business concerns .
Arne Owens , a spokesman for the Christian Coalition , dismissed business ' concerns about the bill as `` much ado about nothing from an economic and trade perspective . ''
He said they reflected `` a callousness on the part of some in the business community to be quite willing to place the profit-making above all else . ''
But Richard O ' Leary , who is chairman of the board of H Enterprises , a Minneapolis company involved in machinery and construction , and who also sits on the chamber 's international and economic policy committees , said , `` We now have the social agenda of the month driving our policies that affect international trade and our standing internationally . ''
The Freedom From Religious Persecution Act is just the latest in a string of actions that business leaders argue damage their interests .
The actions have caused them to wonder who their friends on Capitol Hill really are .
On several key issues _ all supported by a Democratic White House _ business has been thwarted .
Congressional Republicans , bolstered by religious conservatives , blocked the administration 's push for permanent Most Favored Nation trade status for China .
They also stymied a request for $ 3.5 billion for the International Monetary Fund by pairing it with a debate over abortion .
`` Ironically , '' Workman said , `` I was speaking to a group of American businessmen from Europe and said our biggest allies in the House on IMF were Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and the Democrats . ''
The Republicans also couldn n't pass fast-track , the measure to give the president streamlined negotiating authority on trade , although religious conservatives weren n't a factor and the Democrats offered Clinton little help .
But to business , that 's beside the point .
`` If every one of those Republican representatives was as pro-business as they like to maintain when they go home to talk to the local chamber of commerce , you wouldn n't have needed a single Democratic vote to pass it , '' said Charles S. Mack , president of the Business-Industry Political Action Committee , which advises about 1,000 business PACs about which candidates are good investments .
`` I think what is troubling is we 've seen a disturbing number of issues , not all of them trade , in which actions have not matched the rhetoric . ''
Business leaders like Mack and others hint that Republicans could pay a price in this year 's congressional elections if they continue to ignore them or take them for granted .
Mack noted that his group gave about $ 120,000 in campaign contributions in 1996 and would donate $ 200,000 or more this year .
But those numbers are pocket change compared with the group 's potential clout .
`` The effect of that in the ' 96 campaign was that just a hair under $ 10 million went to candidates we endorsed from corporations and associated PACs with whom we have a relationship , '' Mack said .
In its starkest terms , the religious persecution bill became a debate between morality and commerce .
The measure would impose economic sanctions on foreign governments that abuse human rights and practice religious persecution .
It would also ban non-humanitarian aid , oppose loans from development banks such as the IMF and deny visas to foreign officials and others identified as persecutors .
`` Passing this bill will say to the world that the United States will no longer remain silent while people of faith are being tortured , '' Rep. Frank Wolf , a Virginia Republican and the bill 's sponsor , said during the debate .
`` Passing the bill will shatter the silence . ''
It also symbolized one of the legislative fronts where religious conservatives , an influential political voice , hope the Republican leadership will act more aggressively .
Some religious leaders have even threatened to sit out the fall congressional campaign unless they get satisfaction .
That got the GOP 's attention .
The party has only a slim majority in the House , and polls lately show Democrats gaining strength .
After meeting recently with religious conservatives , the Republican leadership emerged newly committed to pushing parts of their agenda .
The religious persecution bill enjoyed widespread bipartisan support and passed 375 - 41 .
Democrats have traditionally backed human rights-related legislation in foreign policy .
Backers also included faith-based conservative groups , such as the Christian Coalition , as well as mainline church organizations such as the Catholic Bishop 's Conference , B ' nai B ' rith and the Southern Baptist Convention .
The Senate will try to pass a modified bill that attempts to mollify some of the opponents , who , besides business , include the White House and the National Council of Churches .
Business leaders said having to choose between morality and trade , as supporters portrayed the debate , was a `` false choice . ''
What about diplomacy , they said , or some kind of multination effort ?
Opponents also contend that the `` one size fits all '' terms of the bill , which treats all potential violating nations the same , could hamstring foreign policy .
And they said the impetus for the bill did not come from overseas , but from domestic groups seeking to make a political statement .
`` We were not getting calls from our people in China and Egypt and Indonesia saying , ` Please , have Congress pass this , ' '' said the Rev. Oliver Thomas , special counsel for religious and civil liberties for the National Council of Churches .
`` A lot of mission people fear that if suddenly we declare all these people to be persecutors , it will seriously impair their ability to do overseas mission work . ''
With the midterm congressional elections on the horizon , political issues are often defined by money and support .
It 's likely that the Christian Coalition , for example , will identify the religious persecution issue as a key vote in the 45 million voter guides it expects to distribute the Sunday before the November elections .
Faith-based conservatives who are politically active also reach voters through religious radio shows that reach as many as 5 million listeners a day .
Business , said former Republican Rep. Robert Walker , now a lobbyist , needs to recognize the changing political landscape , particularly within the Republican Party .
