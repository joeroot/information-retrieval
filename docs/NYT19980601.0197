DANIEL ORTEGA : THE RISE AND FALL OF ` A SKUNK AT A GARDEN PARTY '

He was a young , bookish , bespectacled version of Che Guevara , a young revolutionary whose only romantic touch was the red-and-black silk Sandinista bandanna around his neck .
The Sixties ' style high-heel boots were not a fashion statement , but simply to lift him up to something like average height .
But Daniel Ortega captured the hearts of the post-Guevara generation when he led the ragtag men and women of the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ) into Managua in July 1979 after overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza in a guerrilla war that had soaked Nicaraguan streets in blood .
As `` coordinator '' of the revolution , a man who had spent seven years in Somoza 's jails , often tortured , no one batted an eyelid when the Sandinistas appointed him President of Nicaragua , a post he held until world pressure forced him to hold free elections in 1990 .
As Sandinista leader , Ortega became the new symbol of revolution 20 years after Guevara and Fidel Castro had overthrown Cuba 's dictator , Fulgencio Batista .
With Guevara long dead _ killed in Bolivia in 1967 _ and Castro deeply frozen inside the Cold War , Ortega became the biggest thorn in the side of the United States , and the focal point of Ronald Reagan 's anti-communist paranoia .
His confiscation of property and land , including that of American owners , did not add to his popularity in the U.S.
Reagan called him a `` tin-pot dictator . ''
His successor George Bush called him `` a skunk at a garden party . ''
Genuinely fearing that the Sandinistas would spread their revolution north , up through Central America and Mexico , Reagan ordered Border Patrol guards in such cities as Brownsville , Texas , to be on extra alert .
An awful lot of Americans saw nothing funny about their president 's stand .
More seriously , using the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , President Reagan encouraged and financed the remnants of dictator Somoza 's feared National Guardsmen to form the `` Contras '' _ short for `` Counter-Revolutionaries '' _ a right-wing guerrilla group aimed at overthrowing the Sandinistas and restoring a government more amenable to the Reagan administration .
Based across the Nicaraguan border in Honduras and Costa Rica , the Contras launched hit-and-run attacks , carried out massacres and engaged in combat with the Sandinistas which left tens of thousands of Nicaraguans dead throughout the Eighties .
Like Castro , Ortega thrived on the Americans ' hangups .
He flirted openly with the Cuban leader and became chummy with Iraq 's Saddam Hussein and Libya 's Col. Muammar Qaddafi .
And like Castro , his image of pariah to yuppie America made him even more of a hero to sociallistly-minded youth and intellectuals around the world .
As they had done in the sugar-cane fields of Cuba , young people flocked to Nicaragua to help pick coffee beans `` for the revolution . ''
Usually sandal-wearing backpackers with little money to spend on hotels with hot water , they became known as `` the Sandalistas , '' revolutionary hippies of the Eighties .
Even their Nicaraguan hosts mocked their body odors .
With the decline of the Soviet Union , and an increasingly isolated economy , faith in the Sandinistas faded throughout the Eighties .
What had started as a `` National Liberation Front '' in the jungles of Costa Rica and underground in the slums of cities such as Managua and Leon , had become a disunited party , proven inept at managing the economy .
Nicaraguans were increasingly critical of the ongoing war-footing _ though largely promoted by the CIA-backed Contras _ and the conscription and budget needed to maintain an army seen only as a symbol of defiance against the U.S.
But when Ortega , under worldwide pressure , finally held free elections in 1990 , few doubted his charisma would pull him through for a further six years .
Probably because Nicaraguans had learned to keep their opinions to themselves through years of dictatorship , as well as under the reign of the Sandinistas ' no-nonsense internal security agents , the polls turned out to be all wrong .
Conservative grandmother Violetta Chamorro won easily .
Ortega , now 52 , has been opposition leader ever since , often disrupting public life by organizing strikes and regularly threatening to take up arms again _ a threat few , if any Nicaraguans ever take seriously .
In the 1996 elections , he lost again , this time to conservative Arnoldo Aleman , the current president , who had been jailed by the Sandinistas in the Eighties and seen his coffee farm confiscated .
That defeat came despite an American-style campaign by Ortega and a complete change of image .
Gone was the fiery anti-American rhetoric , replaced by calls for friendly relations .
Gone were the horn-rimmed eyeglasses , replaced by contact lenses .
Gone were the cowboy shirts with rolled-up sleeves , replaced by choirboy-like white collarless smocks .
Gone was the old revolutionary Sandinista anthem with its exhortation to `` fight the Yanqui , enemy of humanity , '' replaced by Beethoven 's `` Ode to Joy . ''
Ortega even brought in former `` Contra '' guerrillas to his campaign , including the notorious Commander Mack , once photographed ordering one of his men to cut a peasant 's throat , in an effort to win conservative votes .
But all to no avail .
Ortega lost again and , despite being reelected Sandinista leader at the party 's Congress last weekend _ four days before his stepdaughter lodged criminal sexual abuse charges against him _ few Nicaraguans believe Ortega will be a presidential candidate next time around .
Even if the rape and sexual abuse charges do not stick , his stepdaughter 's detailed allegations have undoubtedly hurt Ortega 's image at home and abroad .
When she announced the charges , his stepdaughter , Zoilamerica Narvaez , now 30 , was heckled by a few hard-line Sandinista women , shouting `` Crazy Woman , Degenerate ! ''
but backed by other women chanting `` Keep up the fight . ''
Many Nicaraguan women , including Sandinistas , say the party always had a macho bent , shown by the relatively few women given senior government positions despite having served as foot soldiers in the guerrilla war and revolution .
`` Women were always manipulated under Sandinismo , '' Nicaraguan political analyst Moises Hassan , a former Sandinista , was recently quoted as saying .
`` It 's a farce . ''
