GINGRICH PAYS ANOTHER $ 50,000 TOWARD ETHICS SANCTION & HT ; By MARK SHERMAN & HT ; c.1998 Cox News Service
WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich made his second $ 50,000 payment Monday toward the $ 300,000 he owes taxpayers in connection with his violation of House ethics rules last year .
Gingrich , who returned from a trip to the Middle East and Europe on Monday , used personal funds , spokesman Andrew Weinstein said .
He is scheduled to pay another $ 50,000 on Nov. 30 .
The final $ 150,000 is due Jan. 2 , 1999 , the last day of the 105th Congress .
Bob Dole , the 1996 Republican presidential nominee , has agreed to lend Gingrich $ 150,000 for the last payment , but Gingrich has yet to decide whether to take the loan , Weinstein said .
The installment plan was the culmination of a lengthy investigation by the House ethics committee into the partisan political role of tax-exempt , not-for-profit organizations with close ties to , or directly controlled by , Gingrich .
Groups that are exempt from taxes may not take part in partisan activities .
With his speakership on the line , Gingrich eventually agreed to admit that he violated ethics rules by providing false and misleading statements to the committee about the involvement of GOPAC , the political action committee he once led , in the development of a college course he taught in Georgia .
He also acknowledged that he should have sought the advice of tax lawyers about the financing of the course , which was widely broadcast , by tax-exempt groups .
Along with a reprimand from his colleagues in the House , Gingrich agreed to a $ 300,000 sanction , roughly equal to the cost of the investigative work that was required after the speaker provided the false information to the committee .
The penalty was extraordinary in that marked the first-ever ethics punishment of a sitting speaker , but it was sufficiently lenient that Gingrich could continue to serve as speaker .
In his report to the committee , James Cole , the lawyer hired by the committee to lead the investigation , said , `` In addition , the violation does not represent only a single instance of reckless conduct .
Rather over a number of years and in a number of situations , Mr. Gingrich showed a disregard and lack of respect for the standards of conduct that applied to his activities . ''
But in his recent book , `` Lessons Learned the Hard Way , '' Gingrich blamed his lawyers for most of the problem , suggesting that their sloppy work and his lack of attention to their work accounted for his troubles .
He also said he was adamant that he would not agree to any kind of fine .
`` I flatly refused to accept any agreement that would involve or impose a fine , '' he wrote .
`` There is a sharp distinction to be drawn between the principle of reimbursing the House for expenses I had been the cause of and paying a penalty . ''
While final payment will mark the end of this ethics case , the House ethics committee still has a pending complaint to resolve involving Gingrich .
The committee has yet to take action on allegations Gingrich benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed , prohibited aid from GOPAC starting in 1990 re-election campaign and continuing perhaps until 1995 .
And the Internal Revenue Service is investigating whether the tax-exempt organizations violated their non-profit status by helping fund political activities , including the speaker 's college course .
The ethics committee did not reach a conclusion on that issue , deciding instead to let the IRS investigate .
