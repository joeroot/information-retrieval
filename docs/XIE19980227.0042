Chirac Praises U.S. President Clinton
PARIS , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- French President Jacques Chirac Thursday praised United States Bill Clinton as " a responsible and intelligent statesman " and " a bright and open man " who he knows very well .
In an interview with the daily Le Monde , Chirac said that from the very beginning , he knew that Clinton would silently support his diplomatic efforts aimed at peacefully solving the Iraqi crisis .
" I was convinced , because I know him very well , that President Clinton would not launch a military strike without thinking it over deeply and without waiting for the ultimate moment , " said Chirac .
The French president said that as soon as United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed the deal with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad Monday , he and Clinton had a telephone conversation and both of them were relieved that a military confrontation could be avoided .
" When he ( Annan ) returned and we knew the text of the agreement , President Clinton and I called each other .
We were happy and relieved , although we remained vigilant , " said Chirac .
