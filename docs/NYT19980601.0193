It is surprising to find a serene man like Howard Behar in a double-espresso job .
As president of Starbucks Coffee International , the overseas arm of the Seattle-based chain , he has sustained a frenetic pace over the past few months .
In April his firm acquired the confusingly named Seattle Coffee Company _ a London-based chain with 60 stores in Britain _ gaining its first foothold in Europe .
In the past month he has signed deals that will take Starbucks into Malaysia and New Zealand , and has overseen new branch openings in Japan and Singapore .
Meanwhile he has shuttled back and forth to his home in Seattle , a speech at Stanford business school and his son 's wedding in Chicago .
Yet Behar does not seem at all frazzled as he talks about his work , combining a decaffeinated demeanor with generous spoonfuls of sweet sentiment .
His primary goal is to improve people 's lives , he declares , and Starbucks _ the world 's biggest chain of coffee shops , with some 1,600 branches _ is helping him to do so .
First , there are the customers , who can walk into any Starbucks outlet and buy a great cup of coffee , delivered with a smile .
Then there are the employees , who not only earn some money , but also have a chance to feel as good about serving customers as he does .
To the man who is leading Starbucks abroad , therefore , Asia is a place where many different kinds of people share the same goal : `` to be treated with dignity . ''
What is one to make of all this ?
Despite its name , this column is inclined to take wholesome claims at a heavy discount .
And in this case skepticism is no doubt warranted .
For a start , there is the question of whether anyone 's dignity is enhanced by the exchange of $ 2 for a cup of coffee .
Nor , for that matter , is it easy to overlook Behar 's stock options and new Mercedes .
And an opponent seeking to take a cheap shot would in all likelihood point out that , before he joined Starbucks , Behar used to sell time-share property .
To harp on about such things , however , would be unfair .
For one thing , there is no particular reason to doubt Behar 's integrity .
He really seems to mean it when he says that his family has taught him his most important lessons about management .
Moreover , executives such as Behar are nothing rare .
Few talk as plainly , but many share his belief that some of the things employees and customers care about are missed by the accounts .
Behar is undoubtedly right about two crucial points .
Customers like being treated well ; and employees , if they have to work anyway , would rather work in a pleasant environment doing something with a purpose .
Ideally , this has two advantages .
First , if workers treat customers well , there is a better chance that they will come back , thereby boosting revenues .
Second , if employees have the `` tools '' with which to serve those customers , they will receive more smiles and fewer insults , and firms will again benefit _ through better applicants , lower labor turnover , or even lower wages .
For Starbucks , which has a prominent brand and a flexible work force , such things matter .
The firm goes out of its way to buy high-quality coffee beans , and has invested in ways to make better coffee .
But it is hard to charge a premium for coffee if customers can pay less for the same amount of caffeine and comfort just down the street .
Similarly , to compete on costs Starbucks needs a flexible work force .
With low wages and every danger of staff being poorly motivated , it is hard for such firms to cultivate customer-friendliness .
As a result , Starbucks ' core North American business , which Behar used to run , has long emphasized human-resource policies .
It offers all of its front-line employees the same package of health-care and other benefits that its most senior executives enjoy , and tosses in a few stock options as well .
Equally important is the extensive training it gives to its coffee-store employees ( known as baristas , in a nod to Italian supremacy ) , so they can better handle crotchety customers .
Behar thinks this approach is just as crucial in Asia .
It is not enough , he says , simply to attune the firm 's beverages to local tastes : if Starbucks is to win over Asian consumers , it will have to provide topnotch service .
In a city such as Tokyo , where customers may encounter several different branches , the knock-on effects of good or bad service are all the more important .
As a result , Behar has maintained the emphasis on training , and _ despite his demanding travel schedule _ tries to meet all of Starbucks ' growing cadre of Asian employees .
The danger is that all this goes too far , paying too much attention to employees and not enough to prices , margins or distribution .
Paying employees too much , or overinflating their hopes , does not help either .
And shareholders value smiling customers only to the extent that they can be converted into cash .
Starbucks has not been tested yet : its share price has outperformed even a frothy stock market .
Many firms discover how nice they really are only when things start to go wrong .
That said , too many service companies make the opposite mistake .
When a manager is asked to defend his performance , it is easy to document savings in cost or increasing same-store sales .
The fuzzier benefits of happy employees and impressed customers are harder to put in a report .
Unless a true believer occupies a position of power , such things are easily neglected .
Sometimes , a double-espresso job does demand a decaffeinated personality .
