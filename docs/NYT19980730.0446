JETS ' YOUNG PUNTER IS EITHER HIT OR MISS
( th ) By GERALD ESKENAZI c.1998 N.Y .

HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
_ This is not the time of year for a punter _ even a punter whose youth is so prized by Coach Bill Parcells of the Jets _ to be shanking his kicks .
But as soon as Nick Gallery booms one of his 70-yarders _ that 's right , 70 yards _ and his teammates whistle in admiration on the sideline , he will come right back and shank a 25-yarder .
And so it went during Thursday 's morning workout , at which attention was paid to special teams : Gallery , the little-known 23-year-old from Iowa whom Parcells refers to as `` the outhouse or the castle , '' vs. the oldest Jet , 37-year-old Brian Hansen .
Parcells has been so solicitous of Hansen 's age that he does not abuse him by making him punt too often .
You do not get too many boomers from Hansen , but then again , you do not get squibs .
He was in the middle of the National Football League pack last year with a net punting average of 35.3 yards .
His overall average was 43.2 , but the net is what is important to Parcells , and he would like at least a 37 .
Gallery was on the Jets ' practice squad for part of last season .
And he caught the coach 's eye .
`` If there are two positions in my career I 'm spoiled about , '' Parcells explained , `` it 's punters and tight ends . ''
`` Here 's exactly what I think of the punting now , '' he said .
`` If Brian were the punter , we 'd be in the middle third of the league , which is where we were last year .
I think the other guy could be the outhouse or the castle .
With him you see a chance to improve your punting a substantial amount .
But I don n't want some of his punts hitting my earphones . ''
With the Giants , Parcells pointed out , the outstanding punter was Dave Jennings followed by Sean Landeta , a boomer .
Jennings , now a broadcaster , reflected on punting life under Parcells .
`` I punted for him two years when he was head coach , '' Jennings said .
`` What he demanded was production _ the same as he demands from anyone .
Then , in 1985 , I was 33 years old and he told me he wanted to go with a younger player .
I had one of my best camps .
But he cut me for Sean Landeta .
The next day I became a Jet . ''
Hansen was briefly an ex-Jet last year when Parcells first told him he was too old .
But a week before the season , after Parcells had actually cut Hansen in favor of the rookie Todd Kurz , Hansen was brought back .
Kurz was too inconsistent .
`` I 'm being very realistic about this , '' Hansen said Thursday .
`` I know they 're considering getting rid of me .
I guess I wasn n't even supposed to be here in the first place . ''
Hansen also has a philosophical view of his chances .
`` I don n't know if I 'm competing , '' he said , `` as much as it 's up to Nick .
I 'm kind of an insurance policy . ''
EXTRA POINTS
_ Despite their 9 - 7 record , their housecleaning and their attitude adjustment , the Jets remain a team in transition .
And their coach , looking everywhere for youth , is as grouchy as ever .
Bill Parcells looked at the films of Wednesday 's scrimmage , and took it out on several players on Thursday .
It is getting close to showtime : the Jets will open their preseason schedule at Philadelphia next Thursday .
Parcells was especially hard on Jerald Sowell , the second-year player the coach wants to be his fullback over 34-year-old Keith Byars .
But Sowell did not block so well during the scrimmage , and in front of his teammates on Thursday morning , Parcells shouted at him , `` You 're one of those guys good enough to get on the team and not good enough to play .
I know you have the ability , but this is what held you back at Tulane . ''
_ Quarterback Glenn Foley , after being told he had Parcells ' `` benefit of the doubt '' as the top quarterback : `` I 'd like to have a definition of ` benefit of the doubt . '' ' & QL ;
