UK Sees Dramatic Rise in Internet Use
LONDON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- The last six months has seen an upsurge in the amount of adults using the Internet in the UK , especially women , according to a new survey .
Over a million more people have started to use the Web , jumping from 5.9 million six months ago to 7 million now , said the survey carried out by internetTrak .
When the survey first took place two years ago , a mere 14 percent of UK Internet users were women .
That has dramatically risen to 40 percent of first time users now , and the figures are even higher for younger users , where 47 percent of 14 to 17 year olds are female , the survey has found .
" The large increase in the number of users in the last six months clearly demonstrates that the Web is rapidly becoming a day-to-day information source in the UK , " said Shelaine Green , European marketing director of Yahoo , one of the companies to commission the survey .
One of the main reasons for the recent increase of UK Internet users would be the drop in cost to surf the Net with Internet service providers beginning to give free access , analysts said .
