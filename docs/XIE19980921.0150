E. Africa Plans to Stamp out Smuggling
NAIROBI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The revenue authorities of Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania will from early next year revoke the licenses of importers caught smuggling .
The decision comes at a time when smuggling is rife in the east African region , especially in Uganda , where traders say they are being driven out of business , the local weekly East African reported Monday .
The three countries are compiling a directory of all importers in the region .
Those caught smuggling will be de-registered .
" We will work with the registrars of companies to get such companies out , " Elly Rwakakoko , the Commissioner General of the Uganda Revenue Authority , was quoted as saying .
Rwakakoko said the revenue authorities of the three countries had been working together to end smuggling in the region .
Importers and clearing agents currently caught with smuggled goods in Uganda are currently only forced to pay the necessary taxes before their goods are released .
The new measure , according to Rwakakoko , will throw smugglers out of business for good .
In 1996 , Uganda and Kenya introduced cash bonds as a measure to curb dumping and smuggling but they have yet to make an impact in Uganda , said the report .
