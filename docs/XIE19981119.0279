Northeast China Province Steps Up Environmental Protection
SHENYANG , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Liaoning Province , an old industrial base in northeast China , has instructed 929 local industrial enterprises to treat pollution sources within a given period of time .
According to local sources , this campaign to treat industrial pollution at the source will be carried out in three stages , with 37 percent of the task finished by the end of this year and the rest fully completed by 2000 .
It is expected that by the year of 2000 , the province will have treated industrial pollution sources at 1,085 sites which presently cause 85 percent of the province 's total industrial pollution , according to the provincial environmental protection department .
In 1996 , the State Council , the country 's highest governing body , published a regulation stipulating that all industrial pollution sources in the country should discharge according to set pollution treatment requirements by the year 2000 , and polluting enterprises will otherwise be shut down .
Liaoning is China 's heavy industrial base , and discharges of industrial waste have remained high there due to backward technology and out-moded equipment .
The pressure on the environment has become obvious among Liaoning 's dense population .
To support the anti-pollution campaign , the province plans to build more sewage treatment plants , and eight provincial cities will have sewage treatment plants within five years , said the sources .
Construction of four sewage plants in the province is now being carried out , and a sewage treatment plant in the provincial capital of Shenyang , the country 's second largest of its kind , is now in service .
