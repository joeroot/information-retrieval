ROCK RADIO : IF IN DOUBT , WEAR IT OUT
( For use by N.Y .
Times News Service clients ) By BILL GOODYKOONTZ c.1998 The Arizona Republic
( Undated ) - I love the song `` I Got You , '' by Split Enz .
Tuneful , catchy , biting lyrics _ I 've thought it a classic since it was released in 1980 .
The trouble is , I 'm afraid I 'm going to get sick of it .
How , you may ask , is it possible to become tired of a song in 1998 that came out
18 years before ?
Because I live in Phoenix , Arizona , the Valley of the Sun and the home of retread rock radio .
I 'm no wide-eyed naif .
I know that mainstream radio isn n't where I 'm likely to discover new rock songs .
The days of adventuro us , college-radio-style free-form programming , when you could hear a Let 's Active song , followed by a Throbbing Gristle tune , topped off with a Mission of Burma ditty ( `` That 's When I Reach for My Revolver , '' preferably ) , are long gone .
Bu t I heard `` I Got You '' five times in one week not long ago .
You couldn n't hear it that often when it was popular .
Hearing it so many times alerted me to a question that 's long troubled me :
Isn n't anyone else sick of hearing the same old songs ?
Yes , some Valley stations play `` alternative '' and `` new '' rock .
But more often than not , it 's something that has been featured in a movie soundtrack or is already in heavy rotation on MTV .
And when they do latch onto something new , they play
it to death .
Or haven n't you heard `` Sex and Candy '' enough by now ?
Good luck hearing anything else on the Marcy Playground CD until it 's released as a single .
So radio is no longer a useful tool for rock exploration .
That 's OK .
That 's why used-CD stores exist .
It 's incumbent upon the explorer to expend a little legwork when looking for adventure , anyway .
But what are we to make of flipping through the radio dial while driving and hearing Bob Seger warble `` Against the Wind ' ' on three stations at the same time ?
Coincidence ?
Bad luck ?
Alien invasion ?
It 's tempting to blame this on the limited adventurousness of the Rogaine set , the baby boomers who refuse to listen to any music , no matter how interesting or impo rtant , that 's made by anyone who either ( 1 ) didn n't appear at the original Woodstock ( 2 ) hasn n't entered rehab at least once or ( 3 ) falls into the electronic / rap / industrial / ambient / other category ( that 's just so much noise , they 'll complain , much as
their parents did when they heard Jimi Hendrix songs blasting from their bedroom record players ) .
But is that really the answer ?
Some geezers still write good music , after all .
Last year , Bob Dylan released what critics hailed as his best album since before his son was teething , much less leading the Wallflowers .
But where could you hear it ?
At the homes of people who bought the CD , I guess .
Otherwise , tough luck .
`` Classic '' rock rambles on , spewing out a steady diet of old Seger , Bad Company , Journey and the like .
Sure , you may hear `` Born to
Run '' several times a week , but you won n't hear anything from `` The Ghost of Tom Joad , '' Bruce Springsteen 's last _ and well-received _ CD .
As you might guess , money plays a big part in all this .
As in , making it .
`` In a market like Phoenix , which is over-radioed anyway .
.
.
the market is very competitive , '' said Shaun Holly , programming director at KGLQ ( FM 96.9 ) , a `` classic hits '' station .
`` A radio station that really wants to win has to play everything that 's familiar and nothing that 's unfamiliar .
As a result , you kind of narrow the margins of what you 're going to play . ''
And to answer my earlier question , no , apparently you aren n't sic k of hearing the same old songs .
`` You 're going to run the risk and say , ` Man , how many times are you going to play that Bob Seger song ? ' '' Holly asked .
`` And my answer to that is , ` As many times as people want to hear that Bob Seger song . ' ''
Hmmm .
On second thought , forget what I said about `` I Got You . ''
Terrible song .
No reason to play this one on the radio again .
Please don n't request it .
There .
With luck , maybe this will be one song I won n't have to get sick of .
