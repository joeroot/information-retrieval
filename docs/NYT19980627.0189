1998 Cox News Service
ATLANTA -- Quarterback Neil O ' Donnell has several career options after being cut last week by the New York Jets in favor of Vinny Testaverde .
But early indications are that the eight-year veteran 's best chance to regain his starting status and a $ 2 million paycheck probably is in Cincinnati .
Bengals coach Bruce Coslet , concerned by the continuing downward spiral of onetime Pro Bowl passer Jeff Blake , dealt for Indianapolis backup Paul Justin during the spring to push his incumbent starter .
Despite problems in New York , O ' Donnell would represent an even bigger challenge for Blake and possibly an upgrade .
The Bengals , who offered Testaverde $ 2.5 million in the days following his release by Baltimore , would dangle at least that much for O ' Donnell .
There aren n't many other suitors with sufficient salary-cap room to lure O ' Donnell , who also might be limited because he 's represented by agent Leigh Steinberg .
In fact , the only other team that can rival the Bengals as far as money and starter 's opportunity is New Orleans , but Mike Ditka seems satisfied for now with Billy Joe Hobert .
`` Who wouldn n't be interested ( in O ' Donnell ) ? ''
Coslet asked .
`` He 's a tough guy , mentally and physically .
`` He 's an experienced guy who 's won . ''
O ' Donnell might be interested in Carolina , because of his relationship with coach Dom Capers , but Steinberg represents starter Kerry Collins there .
Seattle had legitimate interest in Testaverde and probably will in O ' Donnell .
But the Steinberg stable of clients includes Seahawks quarterbacks Warren Moon and John Friesz .
Rookie Ryan Leaf is said to be struggling enough in San Diego that GM Bobby Beathard could seek veteran help .
But Steinberg has Leaf , plus the club is only about $ 800,000 under the spending limit and still must create cap room to sign its rookies .
Steinberg associate David Dunn called the Bears to gauge interest in O ' Donnell , but Chicago would prefer to restructure the contract of Rick Mirer and retain him as the backup to Erik Kramer .
Raye of hope
Despite his reputation as an offensive innovator , former Kansas City coordinator Paul Hackett rarely allowed quarterbacks Elvis Grbac and Rich Gannon to call audibles in 1997 .
The moratorium contributed to a No. 24 ranking in the passing game , center Tim Grunhard noted .
Under new coordinator Jimmy Raye , quarterbacks will get more freedom to check off at the line of scrimmage with the intent of increasing the number of deep-ball opportunities for wideouts Andre Rison and Derrick Alexander .
Fantasy alert
With quarterback Dan Marino claiming that Troy Drayton is poised for a breakthrough year , fantasy football owners might want to consider the Miami tight end , who has enjoyed a standout offseason .
In the offense redesigned by coach Jimmy Johnson and new coordinator Kippy Brown , the five-year veteran won n't be removed for another wide receiver in third-down situations .
In the last several seasons , Marino asked former coordinator Gary Stevens to expand the role of the tight end .
Among tight ends with 30 or more catches in ' 97 , Drayton averaged 14.3 yards , a figure topped by only Oakland 's Ricky Dudley ( 16.4 yards ) and Shannon Sharpe of Denver ( 15.4 ) .
All in the family
It doesn n't have the makings of a Tom Clancy spy thriller , but the latest chapter in the potential sale of the Minnesota Vikings could create an intriguing twist .
One of the suitors likely to make a bid for the franchise before the July 1 deadline is Bruce Llewellyn , a New Jersey businessman who has joined forces with former Vikes general manager Mike Lynn .
The irony is that Llewellyn is the father of Alexandra Llewellyn , who will marry Clancy when his divorce from Wanda Clancy , his wife of 29 years , becomes final .
Llewellyn and Lynn a few months ago rejected an invitation to be part of Clancy 's bid , which then evaporated .
It might have been an omen when Llewellyn took ill during a meeting with commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Wednesday and had to be hospitalized .
Glen Taylor , who owns the NBA 's Minnesota Timberwolves , appears to be the front-runner to land the club .
One who got away
When Oakland Raiders pro scouting director George Karras resigned last week , it marked the end of a 38-year career bird-dogging for players at the college and pro levels .
Karras didn n't miss on too many prospects but conceded that he failed to recognize potential in a skinny kid who served as equipment manager during his term as assistant head coach at Harvard in the mid-1970s .
The nerdy-looking undergrad was Bill Gates , the founder of Microsoft and now worth $ 51 billion .
Etc.
Fullback Craig Heyward reportedly was one of only two St. Louis veterans to log zero appearances in the team 's off-season conditioning program .

His original team , Chicago , has some interest , but Bears coach Dave Wannstedt would prefer to sign free agent Tony Tolbert , recently cut by Dallas .
...
New Orleans defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian , whose aggressive scheme pushed his unit to a No. 4 overall ranking last year , installed some new 3 - 4 fronts in a recent camp .

The last word ( s )
St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil , asked whether the Rams might be interested in troubled defensive end Alonzo Spellman , recently released by Chicago :
`` Hey , I already take two Advil a day as it is . ''
