CLINTON DROPS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CLAIM , PUSHES FOR ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By JOHN C. HENRY c.1998 Houston Chronicle
WASHINGTON _ Deciding against a Watergate-style fight over executive privilege , President Clinton notified the Supreme Court on Monday that close friend and trusted adviser Bruce Lindsey 's status as a lawyer should protect their conversations about an alleged presidential affair and cover-up .
The president 's attorneys notified the Supreme Court late Monday that he is dropping his executive privilege claim and that there is no longer any reason for the court to act quickly in the dispute over Lindsey 's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case .
Clinton 's decision not to fight over executive privilege and to instead push for a Court of Appeals review of the remaining issue of attorney-client privilege could delay independent counsel Kenneth Starr 's investigation of whether the president obstructed justice by urging a cover-up of his relationship with Lewinsky .
`` The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out , '' White House counsel Charles Ruff told reporters .
`` That 's what courts generally do .
This is not steel seizure , this is not Iranian hostages , this is not U.S. vs. Nixon . ''
Starr welcomed Clinton 's decision not to appeal the executive privilege ruling handed down last month by Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson .
`` I welcome any movement in the direction of our getting more information sooner rather than later , '' Starr said after a speech to a lawyers ' group in Charlotte , N.C .
`` We 're not getting the information .
We 're not getting the facts .
I 'd love to see it move forward as quickly as possible . ''
Clinton had invoked executive privilege in an effort to shield Lindsey and adviser Sydney Blumenthal from having to reveal their conversations with the president or first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to a grand jury being used by Starr to investigate charges of witness tampering or perjury involving the president 's alleged sexual misbehavior .
The abrupt change in tactics by the White House clears the way for Starr to immediately bring Blumenthal back to the grand jury to talk about the sources of derogatory information about Starr and his deputies , which they assert hampered their investigation .
If the Supreme Court agrees with the White House not to review the attorney-client question until the Court of Appeals rules , then Lindsey 's testimony _ if the courts eventually rule that he must cooperate with Starr _ could be delayed at least until fall .
Judge Johnson last month ruled that although the president had a right to exercise executive privilege , that claim was outweighed by the need for information from Lindsey and Blumenthal in Starr 's criminal investigation .
The judge also ruled that Starr 's need for information was greater than the White House claim of attorney-client privilege involving testimony from Lindsey .
In mid-May , the White House notified Johnson and the Court of Appeals that an appeal was being considered , a process that normally could delay the outcome .
Last week , Starr asked the Supreme Court to take the case and issue a ruling before the justices ' summer recess , which usually starts at the end of June .
Starr 's motion focused on Clinton 's assertion of executive privilege and drew parallels to the case 24 years ago that led to President Nixon 's resignation .
The White House responded Monday by dropping the executive privilege assertion and arguing that `` we are not in the throes of a national emergency ...
( and ) the fate of the nation will not hang in the balance '' if the dispute were first settled by the appeals court .
Ruff acknowledged that the gambit could delay the case .
`` There will undoubtedly be folks out there who suggest ...
` Oh , this must be some scheme to delay , '' ' Ruff said .
`` That 's just nonsense . ''
He added , `` When we say we are fighting for an important principle ...
I really mean it . ''
During a meeting with reporters , Ruff also denied that dropping the executive privilege claim was done to avoid further comparisons to Nixon 's use of that argument to keep the White House tapes out of the hands of Watergate prosecutors .
`` I suppose if we were worried about those echoes , we wouldn n't have even started this , '' Ruff said of Clinton 's initial claim of executive privilege .
`` Whatever black cloud of history others are casting over this , it hasn n't affected us . ''
As Ruff 's deputies filed the documents with the Supreme Court , the Justice Department filed a notice that it would appeal another ruling by Johnson that would require the Secret Service agents who guard the president to tell Starr 's grand jury what they know about Clinton 's relationship with Lewinsky .
The Justice Department and the Secret Service had sought a new `` protective function '' privilege that would shield Secret Service officers from having to disclose what they observe while protecting the president .
Secret Service Director Lewis Merletti has said he wants to appeal the case to the Supreme Court if necessary , warning that requiring agents to testify could lead to a presidential assassination .
In her May 22 ruling , Johnson rejected the argument that presidents would put dangerous distance between themselves and their Secret Service detail if agents had to testify about a president 's private life .
