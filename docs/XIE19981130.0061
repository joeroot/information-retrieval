Competition in Tanzanian Beer Market to Get Tense
DAR ES SALAAM , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Competition in Tanzania 's beer market is expected to become tense with a new brewery going into operation in the northern town of Moshi .
The first bottle of beer from Kibo Breweries Ltd. will hit the market in mid January after its building is completed in late December , the company 's New Product Development Manager Donogh Lane said here Monday .
Kibo is expected to produce 3.6 metric cases annually , gaining 10 percent of the beer market in Tanzania , Lane told Xinhua in an interview .
The company was founded in 1997 as a joint venture between East African Breweries , the largest brewing group in east Africa , and the Tarimo family at Moshi .
Investment in the company totaled 19 billion Shillings ( about 28 million U.S. Dollars ) , with East African Breweries controlling 82 percent shares and Tarimo family having the rest stake , Lane said .
" Our entry into the market means that there will now be real competition ... , " he said .
However , he added it will encourage all competitors to improve their standards through training and investment .
He said Kibo will recruit 300 people when it reaches full capacity , but in the short term plans to have some 250 employees , 95 percent of whom are Tanzanians .
Kibo 's brands include Tusker Lager , Tusker Keg , Pilsner Lager , Pilsner Extra and Guinness Stout , he said .
" We intend to launch some new Tanzanian beers , which will be of the highest quality , combined with a significant investment in marketing , " the manager added .
Lane said the South Africa-backed Tanzania Breweries Ltd. ( TBL ) and the Dar es Salaam-based Associated Breweries will control 85 percent and five percent of the country 's beer market respectively .
Major brands of TBL include Kilimanjaro , Safari , Castle and Ndovu , while Associated Breweries is famous for the Serengeti beer .
He said Tanzania 's beer market is still at very young stage of development , and at the moment consumers do not tend to have as much disposable income as in other markets , and so the rate of purchase is relatively low .
A standard bottle of beer of the company is sold at 500 Shillings , he noted .
" As the economy develops and grows , we expect the rate of purchase to increase quite strongly , so there is a good opportunity for all beer companies to grow their sales in this situation , " he said .
