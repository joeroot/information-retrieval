Willy Claes Found Guilty of Passive Corruption
BRUSSELS , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Ex-NATO Secretary General Willy Claes has been found guilty of passive corruption and sentenced to a reprived prison term on Wednesday by the Belgian Appeal Court .
The final verdict from the trial , nicknamed " the trial of the century " , found all 12 defendants guilty and sentenced them all to reprived imprisonment .
The former NATO chief was sentenced to three years in prison with a reprive of five years .
Claes was forced to resign from the top NATO post in October 1995 when allegations rose that the former Belgian economy minister , responsible for comparing rival bids from helicopter manufacturers , received bribery from the Italian company of Agusta .
Guy Coeme , former defense minister of Belgium , and Guy Spitaels , former chairman of the Belgian Socialist Party , were both sentenced to two years of imprisonment with reprive .
The lightest punishment was handed to Francois Pirot who got three months of imprisonment with a reprive of three years .
The trial , that lasted more than two months , investigated into the cash gifts allegedly given by the Italian helicopter company Agusta and the French electronics company Dassault in the late 1980s after they won multi-million franc contracts to supply Belgium with 46 A-106 helicopters and to refit the electronic systems of the country 's F-16 fighter planes .
Total bribery was alleged to be 140 million Belgian francs ( 3.8 million U.S. dollars ) but all the 12 defendants pleaded not guilty .
The death of Socialist Party politician Andre Cools in 1991 led to the discovery of irregularities in party funds that in turn led to a report alleging that the granting of the 1988 contract to Agusta was tainted with illegal acts .
The report also suggested that technical evaluations of the rival bids were handled by Belgian cabinet members to make Agusta 's and Dassault 's bids more favorable .
The trial finally got underway on September 2 this year after a hiatus of a decade but was interrupted when the defendants asked to check up the legal procedures .
It was resumed on September 16 .
