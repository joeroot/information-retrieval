MERGER MAY BOOST AMGEN 'S PROSPECTS
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) BY BEN SULLIVAN c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES -- The news that drug makers American Home Products Corp. and Monsanto Co. will merge in a $ 34.4 billion stock swap has revived speculation over the future of biotechnology powerhouse Amgen .
Under terms of the deal announced early Monday , American Home will exchange 1.15 shares for each Monsanto share , based on Monsanto 's closing price Friday of $ 55.56 a share .
American Home makes products such as Advil painkiller and Chap Stick lip balm .
Monsanto makes products ranging from the artificial sweetener Nutrasweet to Roundup herbicide , and is active in agricultural biotechnology .
Management of the two midsize companies determined they could no longer face bigger rivals alone .
If shareholders and regulators approve the merger , it would create a $ 96 billion life sciences company with $ 3 billion in expected annual profits .
The new entity , still to be named , will be 65 percent owned by American Home shareholders .
The stock swap provides American Home with a strong partner following a difficult year .
In September , the company withdrew two obesity drugs after it was found they could cause coronary bleeding .
And earlier this year , merger talks with British drug maker SmithKline Beecham PLC collapsed .
For Monsanto , the merger has allowed the company to choose its business partner rather than have an acquisition thrust upon it .
A mid-May report in Business Week 's `` Inside Wall Street '' column said Monsanto , along with Amgen , was a leading candidate for a takeover by chemicals giant DuPont .
Indeed , DuPont has made clear it plans to be a major player in the biotechnology arena , with Chief Executive Officer Charles Holliday Jr. saying he expects drugs and biotechnology to account for one-third of the company 's sales within five years , compared to 18 percent today .
The company recently agreed to pay more than $ 2 billion for a 50 percent stake Merck & AMP ; Co. holds in a biotech joint venture the two companies formed in 1991 .
With Monsanto now effectively off the market , Amgen is one of the few remaining firms that immediately could thrust DuPont to the front of the biotech industry .
What would make a DuPont bid plausible , said Genesis Merchant Group Securities analyst Robert LeBoyer , is that Amgen 's research and development infrastructure is unmatched in the industry .
The company spent $ 152.5 million on R&AMP ; D in the first three months of this year , and it has 12 potential medicines in various stages of development for diseases ranging from obesity to cancer .
In addition , Amgen is experiencing slowed growth in sales of its two standard-bearer drugs and has no blockbuster products near completion to make up the difference .
The projected earnings growth shortfall could make institutional investors particularly receptive to a takeover offer , especially one as generous as the $ 25 billion -- or $ 95 a share -- DuPont was rumored to be considering for Amgen .
Prudential Securities analyst Caroline Copithorne said there is far more logic in a DuPont purchase of Amgen than similarly rumored deals in the past featuring pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & AMP ; Johnson and Eli Lilly .
With virtually no commercial biotech drug presence currently , she said , DuPont would benefit from getting Amgen 's research brains and marketing brawn .
Existing drug companies like Eli Lilly already have their own sales forces and would therefore be paying at least in part for redundant personnel , Copithorne said .
But both Copithorne and LeBoyer said a DuPont bid for Amgen remains a long shot .
`` For one , I don n't think Amgen is looking to be acquired , '' LeBoyer said .
And while DuPont wants to grow its biosciences presence , it is still digesting the Merck purchase , Copithorne said .
Taking on Amgen any time soon would strain the company 's management .
`` I 'm just not sure that 's the route DuPont would want to take , '' she said .
