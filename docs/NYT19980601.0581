OFFICER SAYS YOUNGSTER IMPLICATED FATHER IN DOUBLE HOMICIDE
( bb ) c.1998 N.Y .

POUGHKEEPSIE , N.Y . , _ On the opening day of New York 's second death penalty trial , a police officer testified that a 6-year-old boy had implicated his father in a double homicide .
Officer Gregory Wagler described finding the boy , Anthony Williams , crying and screaming that his father had shot him as he sat in the back seat of a car .
The boy , now 8 , is expected to testify later in the trial .
In his opening statement , Assistant District Attorney Edward Whitesell told the jury that Dalkeith McIntosh , 38 , had committed a `` final act of domestic violence '' on Aug. 12 , 1996 .
McIntosh , he said , had shot his estranged wife , Francine Williams , 47 , twice in the head that day as she sat in the idling car on a secluded street here .
Whitesell said McIntosh then turned his gun on the boy , who survived being shot in the face .
And finally , the prosecutor said , McIntosh murdered Mrs. Williams ' 23-year-old daughter , Eunice , as she tried to flee the car .
Part of McIntosh 's motivation , the prosecutor said , was to prevent Mrs. Williams from testifying against him in a pending assault case and to make sure there would be no witnesses to her death .
But the defendant 's lawyer , William Tendy , said the police had picked up the wrong man and carefully rebutted each point raised by the prosecution , in particular asking how Anthony Williams could have said his father shot him if the boy had a mouth full of shattered teeth .
Tendy urged the jurors to keep an open mind .
`` Everything you hear is going to point to someone other than this defendant , '' he said .
`` And you will see the danger of convicting someone _ let alone killing someone _ based on the evidence you are going to hear . ''
If the jury finds McIntosh guilty of first-degree murder , it will then decide on his punishment _ death by lethal injection or life in prison without possibility of parole .
The first witness of the day , a woman who happened upon the scene just after the shooting , appeared to cloud the prosecution 's case .
She said the gunman was carrying a shiny , silver revolver _ something that looked very different from the dull , black weapon shown to her as evidence in the courtroom .
But jurors had already heard in Whitesell 's opening statement that the murder weapon was missing in a swampy area for nearly a year after the shootings , and that exposure could have altered its coloring .
Proceedings in the small courtroom were quiet and orderly _ even when McIntosh turned and waved at the mother of one of the victims .
`` It shows that he has no conscience , '' said Francine Williams ' mother , Maxine Green , with tears in her eyes .
