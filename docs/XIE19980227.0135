Three-Fold Increase in Number of Chinese Cities
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The number of Chinese cities has quadrupled to 666 since 1980 , according to the latest statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Construction .
Vice-minister of construction Li Zhendong told Xinhua today that China 's urbanization is characterized by growth in medium-sized and small cities , and an increasing number of cities in central and western parts of China .
The country 's urbanization strategy aims at " controling the number and scale of large and extra-large cities and to give greater room to medium-sized and small cities as well as small towns in rural areas , " he noted , adding that it has begun to pay off .
Of the 666 cities , 75 are extra-large and large cities , 192 are medium-sized , and 399 are small .
The official said that the rapid urbanization has improved the uneven distribution of cities in eastern , central , and western parts of the country .
These three regions now account for 44 percent , 37 percent , and 19 percent , respectively , of the total number of cities .
Urbanization in the Inner Mongolia , Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions and Hubei , Qinghai , Shanxi , Anhui , Henan and Jiangxi provinces is faster than in other parts of the country .
The official said the number of cities in China is expected to reach 800 by the turn of the century .
