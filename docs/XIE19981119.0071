Man United Manager Plays Down Aussi
LONDON , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- English Premier League club Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has played down reports of a possible line-up with Australian club , Adelaide Sharks .
The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper claimed the Old Trafford club was interested in buying a majority stake in the Sharks , once a decision had been reached on their own proposed 623 million pounds takeover by BSkyB .
" We are not merely talking about players here , the proposals involve a lot more than that , " said former Adelaide player Neil McGachey , friend of Alex Ferguson since the United manager 's former club , Aberdeen , toured Australia in the 1970s .
The news surfaced only hours before United fans opposed to the BSkyB takeover were due to question members of the Board at the annual general meeting .
" Alex wants to set up the best possible opportunities here for Manchester United .
He has a clear vision of where he wants to go .
" He has told me he will be putting the Australian proposals to the new owners as soon as the situation settles down , " added McGachey .
The report says the deal would involved United buying a 51 per cent stake in the Adelaide club , resulting in player exchanges and a takeover of major merchandising rights .
But Ferguson said : " We had lengthy discussions with the Sharks during the summer but the club feels the time isn n't right to take matters any further at present .
We want to concentrate our efforts in Europe . "
Manchester United signed a " memorandum of co-operation " with Royal Antwerp earlier this week , which will result in the Belgian side helping United attract young talent from outside Europe Union .
