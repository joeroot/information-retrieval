Zimbabwe Faces Shortage of Maize
HARARE , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Zimbabwe 's Commercial Grain Producers Association ( cgpa ) Saturday said the country is facing a critical shortage of maize .
Maize is Zimbabwe 's staple food grain .
Zimbabwe this year was forced to import 200,000 tons of maize from South Africa to cover the shortfall of 400,000 tons , cgpa said .
It said there is urgent need to increase maize production so that Zimbabwe does not end up importing the crop at exorbitant prices .
Cgpa Chairman J. Burger told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana that his association has expressed concern about the lack of interest shown by farmers in maize production because of viability problems .
" We need zimbabwe to be self-sufficient to maintain food security , " he said .
Burger stressed the current maize planting process should be speeded up before the planting season draws to an end .
