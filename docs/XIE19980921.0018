Lebanese Government Rejects Militia Conditional
BEIRUT , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- The Lebanese government Sunday rejected pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) 's proposal to conditionally withdraw from its controlled Christian town of Jezzine in south Lebanon .
Responding to the proposal made on Saturday by SLA 's leader Antoine Lahd , Lebanese Minister of Transportation Omar Miskawi said that Jezzine is not a special place compared with any other area in south Lebanon , the official National News Agency reported .
" As every Lebanese , we should be aware of what the enemy is planning , " he said at a news conference held in the country 's northern port city of Tripoli .
He urged SLA militia to pull out of Jezzine without any preconditions as the country 's call for an Israeli withdrawal from south lebanon .
In April this year , Israel said it would withdraw its troops from south Lebanon if the Lebanese government agrees to guarantee its northern security .
Lebanon flatly rejected the offer , asking Israeli forces to leave the country without any preconditions .
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas .
On Saturday , Lahd made a similar withdrawal proposal , saying that his army is prepared to pull out from Jezzine if the government agrees to send its troops to Jezzine and maintain its security , and prevent the region from being used as a base for operations against them .
The SLA has been policing Jezzine and helping Israeli forces patrol its occupied security zone since it was established in 1985 .
Local media reports said that the militia wants to give up Jezzine , an area it has controlled for more than a decade , as it recently suffered increasing casualties inside the area by Hezbollah ( Party of God ) guerrillas bombing attacks .
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is waging a guerrilla war trying to oust 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 SLA militiamen out of the country .
