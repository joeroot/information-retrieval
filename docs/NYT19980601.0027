MARTINEZ BELIEVES WIN WAS TOO LONG COMING
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By LARRY WHITESIDE c.1998 The Boston Globe
NEW YORK _ Winning is everything to Pedro Martinez , that 's the bottom line .
But despite being the winning pitcher in a 13 - 7 decision over the Yankees before a crowd of 55,711 Sunday , Martinez left in the sixth when he lost a chunk of an 11 - 0 lead .
He was happy that the Red Sox held on , but after the game he lashed out at the umpiring crew he believes made his early exit necessary .
In his 5 2 / 3 innings , Martinez threw 130 pitches , 84 of which were deemed strikes .
But Martinez believes he threw many more strikes than that but was not getting the calls from plate umpire Jim Joyce , although he was careful not to mention him by name .
He had another criticism of the crew , which also included crew chief Al Clark , John Hirschbeck , and Ted Barrett .
Martinez , who improved to 6 - 1 , believes they allowed the Yankees ' Bernie Williams to ignore the new directive designed to speed up games .
Williams , Martinez claimed , was allowed to step out of the box at will , often after Martinez was set on the mound .
This made for longer at-bats and contributed to the game lasting 3 hours 45 minutes .
`` I think this is the first time ever I threw in a game over three hours , ever , '' said Martinez .
`` I pitch quicker than anybody on this team and this might be the longest game we played this year .
You 're trying to speed up the game and they don n't want to .
Sometimes it seems the game is very long .
But oftentimes , it 's not our fault .
I keep urging Williams to get into the box .
( Joyce ) gets on me and protects Williams . ''
Martinez is no fool ; he knows such remarks will get back to Joyce , who had departed when an attempt was made to get a response to the remarks .
But even though Martinez is fresh from the National League , he still wants American League umpires to treat him with the respect that goes with being a Cy Young winner with a reputation for pitching quick games .
True , it took the Red Sox 43 minutes to score 11 runs in the third inning .
Manager Jimy Williams said if there would have been a rain delay that long , he wouldn n't even have sent his ace righthander back out there .
But Martinez said he was undaunted by the delay and came out throwing strikes , or so he thought .
Such an outing was personally embarrassing , he said , especially since he gave up four runs , three on a homer by New York 's Joe Girardi in the sixth .
`` I wasn n't tense when I came back , '' said Martinez .
`` That 's why I was pretty upset to be pulled out in that inning .
I did everything I can do to get the three outs .
`` I can see the strike zone better than anybody .
And I 'm not crying about any particular strike .
But some of those pitches were right there .
All it did in an 11 - 1 game in the fifth inning was slow down the game .
We ended up winning the game and I ended up the getting the win .
But the game took three hours , almost four . ''
Martinez wasn n't the only member of the Red Sox to criticize the umpiring .
Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan also thought Joyce 's strike zone was more narrow than usual .
He was even more incensed by the conduct of Williams in the batter 's box .
Just last Wednesday , the Red Sox received congratulations from AL president Gene Budig for their efforts to speed up their games .
An outing like this , said Kerrigan , defeats the whole purpose .
`` I told him we have tried to get our pitchers to work fast , '' said Kerrigan , `` And to throw first-pitch strikes .
The pitchers should dictate the game .
The hitter should not be allowed to step in the box and step back out .
`` There were 55,000 people here .
I don n't think they came to see Bernie Williams stepping in and out of the batter 's box .
That 's bad for the game , bad for the industry .
And the umpire let him do it .
We 're trying to follow the directive of the AL by working fast and have a good tempo .
The nature of the game is that the pitcher has the ball and he controls the pace of the game . ''
Dennis Eckersley issued a bases-loaded walk on a borderline pitch to Tim Raines in a three-run Yankee seventh .
But after giving up a single , he got out of the inning with a strikeout and a double play that halted a threat with Boston ahead , 11 - 7.
New York never came close again .
`` That 's the beauty of having a veteran like Eckersley on your staff , '' said Kerrigan .
`` He doesn n't let umpires upset him .
He just keeps throwing strikes . ''
Martinez says he will do the same thing next time .
He just hopes for better results .
`` I had everything I needed today , '' he said .
`` I had a breaking ball , a changeup , a good fastball .
I felt stronger than the previous two outings when I felt a little tight .
I thought I was going to fly through the game .
`` The long inning was no problem .
I went out there and threw strikes .
That 's your main concern .
Once you get the runs , you want to throw strikes and forget about everything else .
`` It 's just too bad things didn n't work out the way I thought .
When you see Eckersley , who averages half a walk per nine innings , getting squeezed at the plate , it 's unbelievable .
I understand you can have a bad day at the plate .
But if you 're going to ( miss ) it five or six times ...
you 've got to do better than that .
Not only on us , but also on the other team , too . ''
