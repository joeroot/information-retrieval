Smoking Causes 4 Million Deaths Yearly : Conference
BANGKOK , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Cigarette smoking kills about 4 million people a year across the world and half of these victims are in developing nations , experts attending an on-going international health conference here said Thursday .
An official from the World Health Organization said at the " Global Public Health Perspective : Challenges for the Future " conference that cigarette smoking will be the major cause of death in many developing countries within 20 years if governments take no immediate action .
Although illnesses and deaths from other diseases were beginning to stabilize or decline , the risks associated with smoking were rising , he said .
According to the World Bank , unless smoking behavior changes , premature deaths caused by tobacco in developing countries will exceed the combined deaths expected from AIDS , tuberculosis and complications in childbirth .
Participants of the conference urged the governments of developing nations to do more to stop smoking .
Referring to the host country , experts said that although Thailand had introduced tough measures to counter smoking , it is still a major cause of death , via lung cancer , heart attacks , strokes and chronic disorders .
They urged the Thai government to keep the momentum going because results of actions implemented today will be seen only in 10 years ' time .
