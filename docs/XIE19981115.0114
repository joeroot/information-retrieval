UNITED NATIONS -- Iraq assured its unconditional cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspection mission on Saturday night .
It said that a previous letter allowing the return of the U.N. arms inspection teams , sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday morning from Baghdad , was " unconditional and unequivocal " and quite separate from an accompanying annex voicing Iraqi wishes .
The annex was said to have become the focus of the on-going discussion here by the 15-member Security Council , and one U.N. official said that " this could be a long night " for the Council .
Earlier , the United States said the annex set unacceptable conditions for the return of U.N. arms inspectors .
