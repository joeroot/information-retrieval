Chongqing to Breed Southern Tigers in Test Tubes
CHONGQING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- The Chongqing Zoo in this southwest China municipality plans to breed southern tigers , one of the most endangered species in the world , with self-developed tube-breeding techniques .
Southern tigers are found only in China , and a total of 53 are now living in zoos .
The southern tiger in the wild is nearly extinct .
The Chongqing Zoo has bred 24 southern-tiger cubs in recent years , and 16 of them have survived .
The zoo has been cooperating with the city 's genetic and reproduction center and the ultra-sonic medical engineering institute to research test-tube-breeding techniques for southern tigers , and major progress has been achieved .
The zoo will also construct a 5,860-square-meter area as a natural habitat for the test-tube cubs .
