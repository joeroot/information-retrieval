Draft Securities Law Sparks Heated Debates
Many law-makers said that it is necessary for the law to have some provisions to limit the power of government administrations in charge of securities market management and supervision .
They suggested setting up a special committee to keep a check on the CSRC .
Standing Committee member Yu Xinrong pointed out that the draft law contains articles confirming the rights of a stock market supervision body as well as one for the stock exchanges , but no articles covering their obligations .
The draft law bans state-owned firms from getting involved in stock trading .
Some members said this provision does not treat firms of different ownership as equals in market competition and so it should be removed .
The draft should instead stipulate that state firms must not use bank loans to carry out stock trading , said Chi Haibin who is a former vice-minister finance .
To best protect investors , an association to look after their interests should be established , suggested senior economist Li Yining .
" Investors can turn to the association for help if they feel cheated by false financial reports provided by certain companies .
The association can also bring cases to the courts on behalf of investors . "
Many law-makers said the revised law should include harsher punishments for irregularities or violations and the majority of them called for it to have an early passage .
