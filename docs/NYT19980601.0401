A fascination with birds , mammals and other animals takes hold in early childhood and , in many of us , never abates .
And there 's nothing quite like photographing a wild animal to give you the thrill of the hunt without harming the animal itself .
A wildlife photographer 's greatest asset is not equipment nor scientific knowledge , but patience .
Failures , near misses and numbing repetition are as much a part of the experience as any glossy photograph of a bird or beast .
Recognizing the fragility of their subjects , wildlife photographers adhere to a strict code of ethics .
The cardinal rule : If anything you do directly or indirectly endangers , restricts or harasses an animal , stop it and leave .
The integrity of a wildlife photograph vanishes if the subject is not free to come and go , if it shows fear or anxiety , or if it has been provoked to attack or to defend itself .
Beginners must impose upon themselves additional constraints .
Under no circumstances should a novice photograph a bird 's or mammal 's nest , for example .
Your presence is a severe strain on the parents and young , and can have dire consequences : abandonment of the young , exposure of the nest to predators or exposure of unattended young or eggs to life-threatening heat or cold .
Don n't even check the robin 's nest outside your front door .
A skunk or raccoon may later follow your scent trail to the young , whose only defense is their camouflage .
Risk can go both ways , of course , if animals perceive you as a threat .
It was an attack from a disturbed owl that cost British bird photographer Eric Hosking an eye .
& UR ; CHOOSING THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT & LR ; & QL ;
The best wildlife photographs are the most natural ones , and by no means do you need powerful or costly equipment to get them .
Although professional wildlife photographers use super-telephotos in the 400-to-1 , 000-mm range , a 70-to-210-mm zoom lens _ standard equipment for many users of 35-mm , single-lens-reflex cameras _ is adequate in most situations .
Use 200-to-400-speed color film for a good balance between sharpness and light sensitivity .
At many wildlife refuges , animals are plentiful and , because of the almost constant presence of nonthreatening human visitors , relatively tame .
The 200-mm focal length of your zoom lens will often give you a frame-filling image of the subject .
At the world 's most famous wildlife areas , such as the Galapagos , Florida 's Everglades National Park , Antarctica and East Africa 's wildlife preserves , where the tameness of birds and mammals can be remarkable , even the 200-mm setting may be too powerful .
Some wildlife-photography enthusiasts , however , find the lure of a longer lens hard to resist .
For the more timid species , or for potentially dangerous animals from which you must maintain a safe distance , consider a 300-mm lens .
It provides an image 50 percent larger than that of a 200-mm lens , and usually is about as `` fast , '' meaning that it gathers almost as much light _ f/4.5 is commonly the maximum aperture .
Although the increase in size and weight is significant , in good light a 300-mm lens can be hand-held .
Longer lenses almost always require a tripod , because as image magnification increases , so do the blurring effects of camera shake .
You can get extreme close-ups , the kind you see in wildlife magazines , by using a blind _ a tent or wooden structure with openings only large enough to accommodate a lens .
For viewing and photography , some wildlife refuges have permanent blinds in strategic locations .
A blind is especially effective in photographing birds , which lack the keen sense of smell that warns a mammal when the blind is occupied .
& UR ; ` STALKING ' WITH A CAMERA & LR ; & QL ;
Lacking a blind , you 'll have to use stalking techniques .
The tips that follow are designed to minimize an animal 's alarm while letting you get close enough for a good shot :
+ Approach slowly in a zigzag fashion .
A fast , direct approach will cause the animal to flee sooner .
Sometimes it helps to walk sideways , like a crab .
The eyesight and hearing of birds is so acute that , short of using a blind , there is little point in trying to hide .
Simply approach without making any sudden movements .
With mammals such as deer , whose sense of smell is much better than their vision , you 'll be able to get closer if you approach downwind .
If an animal stops feeding and begins staring at you before you 've gotten close enough , either stop or retreat until it again appears unconcerned .
+ Keep low .
As you near the point from which you 'll be able to get a good shot , stay low and take only occasional quick glances at the subject to get your bearing .
If trees are nearby , lean against one to blend with the surroundings .
Animals are suspicious of the upright posture of humans , and it makes them nervous when a perceived predator stares .
+ Raise your camera slowly .
If you don n't have an autofocus lens , don n't waste time focusing and refocusing _ you may get only one brief chance for your shot .
Be prepared for the bird to flush or for the mammal to bolt .
There 's no need for caution then _ stand up straight and shoot .
Don n't hound an animal by endlessly repeating the above steps .
Attempt to photograph it once or twice , then leave it alone .
If you need more than two chances , practice your stalking , focusing and shooting with an imaginary subject .
Don n't be discouraged if you can n't get as close as you 'd like .
Group wildlife shots and pictures that incorporate the landscape are valid , too .
Wildlife magazines have conditioned us to believe closer is better , but often the best wildlife photographs show the animal in relation to more than just its immediate environment .
Ironically , the automobile is one of the wildlife photographer 's most valuable tools .
A car can be used as a movable blind from which animals perceive little threat .
When you photograph from a car , move up to your roadside subject slowly .
Shutting off the ignition will eliminate engine vibrations , but when you start up again the noise may scare off the subject .
For long lenses , camera stores have damps with pan-tilt heads designed to support a camera from a car window .
From the hatch of a Land Rover , the vehicle often used on African photo safaris , a beanbag will cushion a 300-mm lens as you photograph lions , wildebeests , zebras , gazelles and cheetahs .
If you photograph on a safari , be sure to vary your camera position _ shooting only from the Land Rover 's hatch will give your pictures that telltale look of a camera always aiming down .
Protect equipment in a foam-padded camera bag .
A plastic bag over that will keep out dust and sand .
In extreme heat , store film in an insulated bag or cooler , allowing it time to reach air temperature before use .
In East Africa , a van or Land Rover will allow you to get within 50 feet of the world 's most famous animals .
At such ranges a 200-mm or 300-mm lens may be too powerful , but it may not be powerful enough for extremely wary animals such as jackals and leopards .
Successful animal portraiture involves the same patience , skill and quick reflexes that you need for good portraits of people .
Look for something characteristic , unusual , exciting or evocative _ and remember that the light itself may create your picture .
Have patience , but react quickly when the moment occurs .
& UR ; REPAYING THE ANIMALS & LR ; & QL ;
Since the rewards of wildlife photography are so great , can we do something to repay the animals that make them possible ?
Unfortunately , photographs alone do not fully reveal , and may even conceal , the plight of wildlife .
Habitats diminish day by day .
Humankind continues to encroach on nature , and the risk of extinction increasingly threatens the weakest links in the wildlife chain .
By supporting the cause of conservation , a photographer helps strengthen awareness of wildlife 's predicament and proves that his or her interest is in the animals themselves , not merely in their images .
