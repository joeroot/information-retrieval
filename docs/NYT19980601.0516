BULLS SEEK THEIR BIGGEST WIN ON THE ROAD
( ja ) By SELENA ROBERTS c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
CHICAGO _ The Bulls will leave the plane and take their first giant steps of this finals appearance with the trepidation of an astronaut .
There will be excitement , but uncertainty as they plant themselves on the Delta Center floor in Salt Lake City for Game 1 Wednesday in a land that might as well be another planet this year .
The Utah Jazz has changed , from the climate of its confidence to the topography of its mind-set .
This is not the same Jazz team that was at first awestruck before stretching Chicago to six games in last year 's National Basketball Association finals .
And this is not the same swaggering Bulls team that typically enters the finals with all the advantages of the upper crust .
They still have Michael Jordan , but the Jazz holds the home-court advantage .
This has to be unsettling for a Bulls team that was humbled in surviving a seven-game Eastern Conference final against the Pacers , an experience that left the defending champions looking as worn as dust rags .
Perhaps there was only one thing that saved the Bulls ' dynasty from extinction Sunday night : home-court advantage .
This most coveted intangible may be the difference between a sixth title for the Bulls and the dismantling of a gilded franchise .
The Jazz will have the Delta Center and all of its inspirational decibels on its side for Games 1 and 2.
Simply turn back the calendar a day , listen to the blunt voice of Scottie Pippen , and understand exactly how vulnerable the Bulls may be without their home court to lean on .
`` Indiana gave us all we could handle , '' Pippen said moments after the Bulls grabbed Game 7 from the Pacers at the United Center on Sunday .
The Bulls failed to win a game at Market Square Arena , a place that has the same feel and hometown flavor as Utah 's Delta Center .
In tight towns like these , there is intense loyalty .
Usually , somewhere in a crowd , there is a pocket of respectful cheers for Jordan .
Not so in Indianapolis , not so in Salt Lake City .
A home crowd can feed its team , lift it up when it 's down .
Just look at how Reggie Miller sprang alive on his sprained ankle with a little support from his Hoosier friends .
So how did the Bulls lose this valuable asset for the finals ?
In the past , the Bulls have been so above the rest of the league that the other teams looked like ants .
They were not above the Jazz in the regular season .
The Jazz and Bulls had identical records ( 62 - 20 ) .
But the Jazz won the tie breaker and secured home-court advantage throughout the playoffs because they swept the Bulls this season , the only team to do so .
To find the last time the Bulls did not have the home-court advantage for a final , go back to 1993 .
That was the year Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns tested them , but a spry Jordan swooped down to capture the title .
Jordan might be too tired to swoop these days .
On two days ' rest , the Bulls will travel and play against the most-rested team in the history of the league finals .
The Jazz will have been waiting for 10 days .
`` We are curious to find out how we 'll recover , '' Coach Phil Jackson said .
`` Utah runs a great fast break .
If we 're fatigued , we 'll get hurt . ''
So extra naps are on the Bulls ' schedule .
And no junk food .
Last year , a sour slice of pizza left Jordan as green as a surgeon 's gown , although he was able to work his magic at the Delta Center and suck the life out of the Jazz in Game 5.
The Jazz players say they are mentally stronger now and less prone to bow down while Jordan whips up a victory .
But the Jazz has to be wary , as well .
Home court is only an advantage if you keep it .
`` Chicago can steal one of those first two games , '' Indiana Coach Larry Bird said .
`` I was in a situation once where I had eight days off .
There 's no way you can stay in game shape by sitting around .
Chicago could go out there and get one early . ''
It will be against the odds , though .
The Jazz will likely be more stoked than stale when Game 1 begins , ready to seize upon the punch-drunk champions .
`` We 're tired , but out heart isn n't tired , '' Jordan said .
`` For a team that 's trying to win for the third time in a row , it 's not uncommon to fight yourself .
That 's the battle we face now .
There are so many expectations people have for us , and you try to live up to them . ''
But if the Bulls can rise above their weariness , if they can take a game at the Delta Center and swipe the home-court advantage from the Jazz , this could go down as the greatest achievement of their supreme era .
This would be the ultimate challenge .
That 's all Jordan and the Bulls have ever needed .
`` We 're fighting an uphill battle , but we haven n't lost our confidence .
Believe me , '' Jordan said .
`` No one has ever taken anything from us .
If you look at our record , we 've never lost in the finals . ''
