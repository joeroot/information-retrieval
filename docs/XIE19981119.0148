China 's administrative departments for industry and commerce , which are in charge of trademark registration , increased the the fine for trademark infringement to 4,063 yuan per case , on average , seven percent more than last year .
They also turned over 43 persons to judicial organs for further penalties , an increase of 72 percent .
Statistics also indicate that east China 's Zhejiang and Shandong provinces handled more than 1,000 cases respectively during the period , the most in the country .
Local analysts point out that since the Trademark Law was put into effect in March 1983 , China has established a comprehensive series of trademark laws .
China has become one of the top 10 countries in the world in trademark registrations in force , said Teng .
The number of trademark registrations in force topped 860,000 last year , compared with only 80,000 in 1982 .
