Israeli General Leaves Army to Run for PM
JERUSALEM , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Israel 's former chief of general staff Lt . - Gen.
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak was officially discharged from the army Thursday and decided to run in the upcoming general elections .
Shahak left his official post in July and under the army regualtions , he has 100 days on leave .
During this period , he could not engage in any political activities as stipulated by law .
Shortly after the discharge , Shahak went directly from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to call on President Ezer Weizman as a civilian .
During the meeting , the two discussed Shahak 's political future and issues concerning the upcoming elections in the country .
Recently , the opposition Labor Party has tried to ask Shahak to join the Labor , but the attempt failed .
Shahak intents to set up a centrist party together with former Tel Aviv mayor Roni Milo and Dan Meridor , parliament member from the Likud Party .
Meridor left the Likud on Wednesday .
Milo and Meridor met in Jerusalem Wednesday to discuss the merger with Shahak , but nothing has been finalized .
Shahak said Wednesday night that he will do everything possible to topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the most effective way to do so is by establishing a center party .
The Left can not win the elections for prime minister , and therefore a center party , which will include representatives of broad segments of the public , has to be created , he said .
The political restructure has began in Israel shortly after the parliament passed on Monday its first reading of the bill calling for early elections .
The ruling Likud Party is facing a split as several key members are trying to replace Netanyahu as the party leader .
The Likud 's Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert , supported by key Likud members Uzi Landau and Communication Minister Limor Livnat , decided on Wednesday to oust Netanyahu from the party 's leadership .
Olmert met with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Thursday morning to decide who will come out to contest Natanyahu .
Mordechai will announce soon whether he will leave Likud or cooperate with Olmert .
