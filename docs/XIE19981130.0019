Although the exact number of voters who have registered will not be known until Thursday , the Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) estimated that five million of the 12.7 million eligible voters in the five provinces have had their names on the voters ' roll .
The registration points throughout the provinces were scheduled to be closed at 9 p.m. local time Sunday .
