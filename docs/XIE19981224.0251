Nigerians Asked to Brace up for Difficult
ABUJA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Nigeria 's economy faces a " bleak " future following the crash at the international oil market , the counry 's Minister of State for Finance Wilson Etuk-Udo warned Wednesday .
Speaking at the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee ( FAAC ) meeting in capital Abuja , the minister described the revenue prospects for next year as " hazy " because the price of crude oil is unpredictable at present .
At the meeting which is part of the on-going meeting of the Federal Executive Council ( FEC ) , he said next year 's budget would focus on priority programs and projects as well as on-going projects , especially those in the final stages of completion .
Etuk-Udo stressed the need for fiscal discipline in consonance with the dwindling national revenue with the federation account receiving 30 billion Naira ( 86 Naira equal to one U.S. Dollar ) , less than the 284 billion Naira projected .
Nigeria is the sixth largest oil producing country in the world with a daily export of about two million barrels of crude oil and some 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings depends on oil export .
The country 's 1998 budget is based on 17 U.S. Dollars per barrel of crude oil but the actual price declined to less than 12 Dollars per barrel for the past 11 months .
The effect of the reduced resource to the federation account which provides the funding for the three tiers of governments in the country are that allocations have been drastically cut in line with revenue , said the minister .
The federal government received only 126 billion Naira for 1998 instead of 138 billion Naira while the 36 states and capital Abuja received about 66 billion Naira instead of 68 billion Naira for the year .
Local government councils received about 5 billion Naira less than the 56 billion Naira projected for the year of 1998 , the minister told the meeting .
According to him , the only good news is the inflation rate which stands at 6.6 percent instead of nine percent projected for the year while interest rate remains stable throughout the year .
At the two-day FEC meeting expected to end Wednesday , ministers and senior government officials discussed next year 's budget , the privatization of some government-owned companies , the dual exchange rate and Monday 's price increase of petroleum products .
