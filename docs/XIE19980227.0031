Roundup : Lesotho Preparing for General Elections
JOHANNESBURG , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Lesotho will dissolve its parliament Friday , paving the way for the mountain kingdom 's third democratic general elections on May 23 .
Authorities said Thursday the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy ( LCD ) would pass a motion calling for the dissolution of parliament , after which the country 's head of state , King Letsie III , would by proclamation declare parliament dissolved .
The independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) Wednesday gave an all-systems-go signal for the election , to be run by the IEC for the first time .
" Voter registration ended Sunday and we expect the returns tomorrow , " IEC chairman Mafisa Sekara told the press Thursday in the capital city of Maseru .
After the announcement of the election date , the IEC drew up the election program , and plans to set up more than 2,400 polling stations countrywide were progressing smoothly , said Sekara .
According to the chairman , helicopters will be used for the hard-to-reach rural areas to ensure that voting goes smoothly there as well .
LCD Deputy Secretary-general Monyane Moleleki said the thrust of the party 's election campaign would focus on social security , job creation , education and the economy .
He said the LCD was going into the election , confident that the foundations for democracy had been laid .
The challenge Lesotho now faced was to entrench the gains made in democratic governance over the past five years , he added .
The LCD 's former leader , 79-year-old Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle , has declared himself unavailable for re-election .
He recently declined re-election to the party leadership , citing ill-health and old age .
Deputy Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili , who filled the position of party leader , and his deputy , Foreign Minister Kelebone Maope , are expected to contest the premiership .
Political analysts believe poverty , unemployment , crime and the government 's intention to prevent religious groups from playing a role in education will be among the issues opposition parties will raise during the campaign .
They said poverty remained the number one problem in the country , and with the continuing retrenchment of Lesotho mine workers in South Africa , the situation would get worse .
The increasing theft of livestock was also expected to feature high in the minds of the electorate .
Cattle farming is the major income earner of most rural population in Lesotho .
The analysts believe that the government 's introduction of legislation threatening the involvement of religious groupings in education would result in religious issues affecting the poll .
