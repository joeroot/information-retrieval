Japan 's October Trade Surplus Up 23.9 Percent
TOKYO , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Japan 's merchandise trade surplus in October jumped 23.9 percent from a year earlier to 1.37 trillion yen ( about 10.6 billion U.S. dollars ) , marking the 19th straight month of increase , the Finance Ministry said Thursday .
The ministry attributed the rise in trade surplus to a rapid decline in imports , which contributed to a setback in exports .
Exports fell 5.7 percent to 4.382 trillion yen ( about 33.9 billion dollars ) , down for the first time in five months , due to the continued weakness in demand from other Asian nations , the ministry said .
Imports slipped 14.9 percent to 3.012 trillion yen ( about 23.3 billion dollars ) , posting the 10th straight month of a decrease , it said .
Japan 's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States soared 31.9 percent to 719.7 billion yen ( about 5.6 billion dollars ) , its 25th consecutive monthly increase .
Japan 's surplus with other Asian countries totaled 315.5 billion yen ( about 2.4 billion dollars ) , down 40.9 percent , while that with the 15-member European Union ( EU ) advanced 41.8 percent to 426.1 billion yen ( about 3.3 billion dollars ) .
Japan 's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of goods clearing customs and is reported before an adjustment is made for seasonal factors .
The yen averaged 129.37 to the U.S. dollar in October , down 6.3 percent from a year earlier .
