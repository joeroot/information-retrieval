GOLDMAN , SACHS NEARS DECISIVE TALKS ON GOING PUBLIC

NEW YORK _ The partners of Goldman , Sachs & AMP ; Co. are deep in discussion about how best to structure their storied firm and whether to open it to public ownership , Jon Corzine , Goldman 's senior partner , told employees Monday morning , executives at the Wall Street firm said .
`` Consideration of this complex issue will quickly be coming to a head '' and `` will be considered by the full partnership , '' Corzine said in a broadcast to employees that was taped , according to several Goldman executives who heard the tape and relayed what he had said .
`` The guiding principles in this discussion , '' Corzine continued , are `` what 's in the long-term best interests of Goldman , its mission and its employees . ''
While proposals for taking Goldman , Sachs public have come up several times in years past , the recent rapid pace of change in the financial-services industry _ in particular , the planned $ 70 billion combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group , and the rapid expansion of Goldman 's chief competitors , Merrill Lynch & AMP ; Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter _ make the current discussion at Goldman more urgent .
Its competitors are able to use their stock to expand rapidly into new areas of business and into other parts of the world .
The pressure to expand has prompted discussion within Goldman , Sachs over selling the firm 's shares , perhaps even linked with a partnership with another big financial institution .
At Goldman , a firm whose employees are considered the most disciplined and the most loyal on Wall Street , there is increasing anxiety about the partnership 's ability to hold its own with just $ 6.3 billion in capital when its main competitors count their capital in the tens of billions of dollars .
In the past , disagreements between senior and junior partners have often derailed proposals for going public .
In general , Goldman 's more senior partners , with their much larger shares in the firm , have tended to favor going public , but the junior partners _ who have yet to acquire substantial stakes _ are less willing to sell .
But some junior partners and managing directors reached in recent days say that there is now a stronger chance of a sale of shares , perhaps as a first step toward a merger or a significant acquisition .
Referring to prospects for an initial public offering , a junior partner , who declined to be identified by name .
said , `` An IPO is not interesting except as a step toward a merger or significant acquisition .
And `` if there is a sale of stock , '' he added , `` it is likely to involve a minority of the firm , widely expected to be 15 percent or less . ''
On June 12 , Goldman 's 190 partners gather in Rye Brook , N.Y . , in Westchester County , for their annual meeting , where they will review an extensive internal report on the firm 's current and proposed financial structure now being prepared by a small internal team led by Christopher Flowers , a partner who advises financial institutions .
The time is right to consider these issues now , Corzine told employees Monday , precisely because the firm is doing so well , without `` the anxieties of business or leadership stress . ''
Last year , Goldman made more than $ 3 billion in profit before taxes , a record .
In this year 's first quarter , which ended on Feb. 28 , Goldman made $ 1.02 billion before taxes .
As members of a partnership , Goldman partners settle their taxes individually .

Colleagues say Corzine favors finding a strong consensus on whether the firm should remain a private partnership of sell itself in a public offering .
Without such a consensus , it is unlikely that the question of whether to go public would be put to a vote of the partners , several of the firm 's executives said Monday .
Corzine has in past votes been one of the partners who has supported the efforts to take Goldman public .
But he believes that without a consensus , the issue should not be put to a vote of the 190 partners at the June meeting , his colleagues say .
`` I would be shocked if we were asked to vote up or down on one plan for the future at the meeting , '' the junior partner said Monday .
`` But I do think that by June 13 we will know either that there is the consensus for moving forward in some strategic direction , or whether people want to leave things as they are . ''
Among the leaders who appear to be leaning toward some kind of stock sale are Henry Paulson Jr. , Corzine 's co-chairman and co-chief executive ; Roy Zuckerberg , Goldman 's longest-serving partner , who has one of the largest shares in the firm ; and Robert Hurst , a vice chairman , who runs the investment banking business .
But there are key leaders who question such a move , asking whether altering the firm 's structure would damage it just as it is achieving such success .
John Thain , the finance director , and John Thornton , the star of Goldman 's European business , who is often mentioned as a potential future leader of the firm , are in this group , Goldman executives say .
