Cyprus , Greece to Protest Turkey Over Nuclear Plant
NICOSIA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Cyprus and Greece on Thursday agreed to join forces to protest against Turkey 's construction of a nuclear power plant on its southern coast .
The agreement was reached during a meeting here between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and visiting Greek Minister for the Aegean Elizabeth Papazoi who arrived here Thursday .
Speaking after the meeting , Papazoi said that Turkey aspires to be a tourist destination , but its intention to construct thirty nuclear power plants , most of which would be erected on its southern coast , is " an unjustifiable energy choice . "
Turkey has announced a plan to construct a nuclear energy plant in Akkuyu , on Turkey 's southern coast , north of Cyprus .
Papazoi noted that the plant would directly affect the environment and the tourist industry in the whole region .
The Greek minister said that Turkey , " with its anti-environmental profile , can not guarantee that this plant will operate on modern models , " adding that it would only cover two percent of Turkey 's future needs , at a price three times higher than today 's cost of hydroelectric and natural gas power .
She said that the Akkuyu plant would be an environmental hazard , as the location is prone to earthquakes , adding that a nuclear accident would greatly affect the Aegean .
It is for this reason that Greece and Cyprus must cooperate to prevent the construction of the plant , Papazoi pointed out .
Referring to her meeting with Clerides , Papazoi said that they also discussed other matters such as bilateral cooperation , as well as the multiple pollution caused by Turkey 's heavy industries and their untreated toxic waste that flows into the sea .
