MANAGUA _ The sky is thickly overcast ; the smoke makes eyes water and lungs gasp for breath ; the muggy heat is unbearable .
This is the Nicaraguan capital , Managua .
Life was much the same this week in Mexico City , which was on full smog alert .
Honduras reported a continuing sharp rise in respiratory disorders , and until Monday the country 's four main airports had all been closed for some days for lack of visibility .
At Tikal , in Guatemala , 700 firefighters were struggling to protect historic Mayan temples .
For weeks now , fires have raged in scrub and forests from Panama to southern Mexico .
Their effects are devastating , and will long outlast the human discomfort .
In Nicaragua alone , a British-aided monitoring program using satellite images has counted many thousands of fires , especially on the Caribbean side , whose forests , stretching across into Honduras , are the last really large area of pristine forest in Central America .
In some places the fire front is 20 , 30 , even 50 kilometers wide .
Nicaragua has about 40,000 square kilometers ( 15,450 square miles ) of forest .
But that is only half what it had in 1960 _ and about 500 square kilometers a week have recently being going up in smoke .
At last , Central Americans are noticing their own threatened environment , and listening to the experts who have been warning them for years that far more must be done to protect it .
It is easy , this year , to blame El Nino .
But many of the fires were started deliberately to clear land , only to run out of control in the drought and heat .
The real trouble , now as for 30 - 40 years past , in Nicaragua and Honduras alike , is not weather but people : big ranchers clearing land for cattle , slash-and-burn peasant farmers , timber companies logging indiscriminately and often illegally : `` They get permission for 50 trees and take 500 , '' says one angry conservationist .
And behind these are the politicians and officials who allow it all and often profit from it .
In Nicaragua things have grown worse as thousands of destitute former Contra guerrillas , many with little skill in farming , have moved into uninhabited ( and theoretically protected ) forests in the north , and burned them to get land .
Timber companies have played their part ; a Korean one has been accused not only of cutting into precious hardwood forests around and in the Bosawas reserve on the Caribbean coast , but of opening trails into the forest for settlers like the ex-Contras .
Peasants who might wish to protest _ there are such _ dare not : they would pay for it if they did , they say , and they don n't mean in money .
A Nicaraguan ecologist , Kamilo Lara , says that if destruction goes on at the current rate _ and he is not just thinking of this year _ `` Nicaragua will be a desert in 50 years ' time . ''
At least he is alive to utter the warning .
In Honduras , in this decade , two leading ecologists have been murdered .
Others have received death threats and are now afraid to speak out .
That it is worth silencing such people shows how high the economic stakes are .
The two ecologists ' friends readily name the army officer widely believed to have been behind the murders .
No one has ever been put on trial , let alone punished , for them .
In Honduras , there is no effective control of logging , say ecologists .
Local indigenous peoples have complained in the capital , Tegucigalpa , of ladino settlers moving into their ( supposedly protected ) areas in Mosquitia and elsewhere in the east , and even killing those who resist them .
No one has much cared .
Yet El Nino is forcing even the previously indifferent to sit up .
Mosquitia is far away , but in the latest fires some 70 percent of the pine forests around Tegucigalpa have burned .
The capital 's three reservoirs are all but dry .
Water is being taken by tanker around San Pedro Sula , the country 's commercial capital , as it is in the Nicaraguan highland city of Matagalpa .
The authorities ' response , however , has not been impressive .
A diplomat in Honduras talks of a natural disaster of `` catastrophic proportions , '' about which the government , he says , is doing `` damn all . ''
Honduran businessmen , lamenting the economic disruption , echo his complaint .
In Nicaragua there is said now to be `` serious concern at the highest levels , '' but still no consensus about what is to be done .
A meeting to decide on and coordinate action is scheduled _ for early June .
But neither government action nor a flood to match Noah 's could restore the forests as they were .
Once burned , say conservationists , forest areas will inevitably be taken over by farmers .
Siegfried Kasl , a technical adviser to a German project in Nicaragua 's Bosawas reserve _ named a UNESCO `` biosphere '' reserve only in February _ says that it will need military protection : otherwise , `` after the vegetation is destroyed , peasants will invade . ''
Leave the last word to Nicaragua 's La Prensa , not a famously radical newspaper : `` Desolation and destruction are everywhere ; if nothing is done Nicaraguans will be without flora , fauna or food . ''
