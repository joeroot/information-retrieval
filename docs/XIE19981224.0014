French Judges End Inquiry into Roland Dumas
Dumas , 76 , who served as foreign minister under President Francois Mitterrand and is now president of France 's top legal authority , the Council of State , was accused of abusing social properties and concealing his participation in the act by conspiring with his former mistress Christine Deviers-Joncour and others .
The judges did not reveal the outcome of the investigation by the two judges , Eva Joly and Laurent Vichnievsky .
Judicial sources said they will most likely send Dumas and the others involved in the case back to court for further investigation .
Dumas is suspected of helping Joncour receive a monthly payment and millions of francs in commissions from the oil group Elf-Aquitaine from 1989 to 1993 .
In one particular incident , Elf won support and approval from Dumas , who was then serving as foreign minister , in a 1992 deal involving the sale of three French frigates to Taiwan .
