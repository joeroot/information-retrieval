GOVERNOR 'S RACE ENDS WITH TUB-THUMPING BARNSTORMING
By CARLA MARINUCCI and ROBERT B. GUNNISON
In the frenzied closing hours of this year 's gubernatorial primary , four battling candidates delivered what has been largely lacking in the 1998 TV-dominated campaign : color , excitement , talk about issues and face-to-face appearances before thousands of real live voters .
Democratic front-runner Gray Davis was fired up and emotional Sunday before a receptive congregation at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles _ and talking like a winner .
A spirited Rep. Jane Harman , fueled by internal polls suggesting she is gaining on Davis , barnstormed the state in a six-seat airplane filled with powerful female backers , arguing for `` bold leadership '' on education , gun control and health care .
Businessman Al Checchi finished up a statewide school bus tour _ seemingly oblivious to polls showing him in last place _ with a push for the Latino vote , crooning `` Guantanamera '' to the strains of a mariachi band in Los Angeles .
Meanwhile , state Attorney General Dan Lungren , all but unopposed for the Republican nomination , was relaxed enough to joke about how his campaign against Davis might go .
As an estimated 6 million California voters prepare to go to the polls Tuesday , the final weekend marked a clear departure from the carefully crafted barrage of 30-second TV spots that have defined the political season .
Instead , the candidates at last let their guard down _ giving voters a glimpse of the personalities and passion at the heart of their quests .
The differences were most dramatic in Los Angeles , where Davis and Checchi nearly crossed paths at morning services at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church , a powerhouse of social and political activism .
The church 's pastor , the Rev. Cecil `` Chip '' Murray , had endorsed both candidates _ and both delivered memorable campaign moments at two different morning services .
Davis , accused of blandness throughout his campaign , abandoned & UR ; & LR ; his usual restraint _ raising his arms with the choir on the church dais .
`` Praise the Lord and thank the Lord for this great church , this great ministry and your great pastor ! ''
said Davis before several hundred worshipers at the 8 a.m. service .
Davis , a Roman Catholic , took on an evangelical air , telling churchgoers that his wife , Sharon , `` brought me back to the Lord a few years ago . ''
`` We need a governor who will bring us together .
We 've had enough of the division , '' said Davis .
`` I 've spent my whole life in service to you .
I went to Vietnam 30 years ago , '' he reminded them , adding that he also worked for former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and former Governor Jerry Brown .
`` I believe how you live your life counts on at least two days , '' Davis said , `` Judgment Day and Election Day . ''
Checchi , who polls show has left a sour taste in voters ' mouths with his $ 30 million spent on mostly negative TV advertising , changed tactics .
His campaign pulled harsh attack ads from some San Francisco television stations , and in other areas of the state substituted more homey spots , like one starring kids mispronouncing his name .
At the First AME , Checchi , also a Catholic , shared a prayer book with hometown Congresswoman Maxine Waters _ whose autographed 8-by-10 glossy photo `` suitable for framing '' was mailed statewide to voters with her endorsement of Checchi .
Then , with the cadence of a preacher , Checchi talked about the state 's $ 4 billion surplus as he delivered one of the most passionate and effective speeches of his campaign .
`` I may not be a professional politician , but I 'm not blind , '' he told churchgoers .
`` We do not have a surplus of classrooms .
We do not have a surplus of teachers .
We do not have a surplus of educated children .
I go to these communities , and the only thing I see is a surplus of jails . ''
`` I don n't see a surplus of programs after school , '' Checchi told them .
`` I don n't see a surplus of drug treatment programs .
...
I don n't see a surplus of anything except wedges and meanness .
And I 'm telling you , we can n't have another 25 years like the last years . ''
Later , with state Sen. Richard Polanco , D-Los Angeles , he let loose again , crooning with a mariachi band , holding babies , and handing out copies of his 90-page `` Checchi Plan '' at El Mercado , a favorite Latino marketplace .
Harman 's weekend marathon by small plane was also full of spunk and vigor _ clearly energized by what her campaign manager , Bill Carrick , said were internal polls suggesting the candidate was within 5 points ' striking distance of Davis .
On Saturday , she barnstormed the state _ from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to San Jose , Sacramento , Oakland and Berkeley .
Throughout , she hammered on themes that studies show women care most about _ gun control , health care reform , reproductive choice , education , and tobacco .
Harman abandoned her more cautious speaking style for outright passion , repeating four questions at each stop : `` Who offers bold leadership ?
Who will heal this state ?
Who has run a positive campaign ?
And who can beat Dan Lungren ? ''
The three-term congresswoman was upbeat as she crisscrossed the state .
At her side was Ellen Malcolm , the founder and president of Emily 's List , the influential Democratic pro-choice women 's political action committee .
Joining them at various stops were Congresswomen Zoe Lofgren and Anna Eshoo of San Jose , Lois Capps of Santa Barbara and Juanita Millender-McDonald of Torrance .
San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer , retired Rep. Ron Dellums , and state Sen. Hilda Solis of Los Angeles , also appeared along the way .
`` We do not want the limp of Davis , the lip of Checchi , or the soup-warmed-over of Lungren , '' Millender-McDonald yelled to the crowd at a Santa Barbara park .
`` It 's not just because she 's a woman , but I 'm happy that she is . ''
In a community center of `` Sal Si Puedes , '' the San Jose Latino heartland , Solis urged immigrant voters to support the candidate whom she said could work with both political parties and yet had & LR ; `` el corazon de una madre , '' & LR ; the heart of a mother .
At each stop , Harman told supporters not to believe the polls .
`` In 1992 , no one thought I could win , '' Harman said .
`` Most of the likely voters are still undecided _ and undecided is not going to beat Dan Lungren . ''
Harman 's personal appeals clearly moved some off the fence .
`` I 'm definitely with her , '' said Toni Wellen , co-chairwoman of Santa Barbara Women Against Gun Violence , who watched Harman give a strong anti-gun talk .
`` Hearing her made the difference . ''
And in Sacramento , the candidate had a craving for ice cream and stopped at Vic 's , a local institution .
The young woman behind the counter dished her up a mocha swirl and said , `` I 'm voting for you . ''
Meanwhile , Republican Lungren took some time to joke about the medical marijuana guru who is his `` main '' rival on Tuesday 's ballot .
`` I do have to get past this guy from San Francisco , Dennis Peron , '' Lungren told a GOP rally in Torrance .
`` I confess , I did indict him .
But that was before he was a candidate and also before he was a Republican . ''
Lungren barnstormed across Los Angeles on Saturday , hinting about his possible strategy against Davis .
`` I thought I was going to have to spend millions of dollars reminding people that he worked for ( former Democratic Governor ) Jerry Brown and he brought it up three times in the first debate , '' Lungren said .
`` We 're going to have some fun out there . ''
