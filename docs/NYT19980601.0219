ALL POLITICS IS ...
FUN
Commentary ( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By ROB MORSE c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
SAN FRANCISCO _ `` You write too much about politics , '' said a woman who works the checkout stand in my grocery store .
I admit it .
I do .
There are other things I enjoy in life , like comedy , drama and heaps of money .
Politics has it all , plus the ability to reshape life _ or end human life on this planet .
In what other field but politics would Al Checchi , an unknown businessman who became a Democratic candidate for governor , spend $ 40 million of his own money to become hated all over California ?
Some entrepreneur Checchi turned out to be .
Bill Gates made $ 45 billion while becoming hated all over the entire world .

Barry Goldwater died on Friday , and his death affected me a lot more than I would have predicted when I was 18 .
He 's the man who got me interested in politics , in a reverse sort of way , when he sank himself in the 1964 presidential election by saying , `` Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice . ''
Visions of mushroom clouds danced in voters ' heads .
Instead we got Lyndon Johnson and a long , sad education in napalm and street politics .
The best man didn n't win .
On the other hand , we 'll never know if Goldwater would have found his place in history by ending history with Gen. Curtis LeMay 's nukes .
Goldwater did better by losing , and being remembered as the honorable man and true conservative he was .
What I recall best is having to defend Johnson 's brand of liberalism in discussions with my conservative friends .
Except for civil rights , it wasn n't easy .
But they were discussions , not fights .
Those were the days when conservatives and liberals still talked , and were friends .
Those were the days when people still called themselves liberals , before liberals in Washington started liberally killing kids in Vietnam .
Those were the days .
Now almost everyone is a little conservative and a little liberal , and hates being labeled .
Maybe these are better days .
Maybe it 's because these are better days that we can afford to hate politics and concentrate on the finer things .
Still , I don n't know why everyone hates politics .
What 's to hate besides the politicians ?
It 's a great spectator sport .
It has to be at the national and state level , because only those who can pony up big donations or the family fortune can play .
Despite the higher entrance fees , politicians are smaller .
However , they 're examined under bigger media magnifying glasses .
The Congress is a much smaller place than when Johnson and Goldwater were there .
When you speak of principles , the names `` Trent '' and `` Newt '' don n't spring to mind .
But for shtick political comedy , you can n't beat car-alarm mogul Darrell Issa running for Senate in California amid allegations he stole cars as a youth , inflated his military record and once took a gun into an office during a business transaction .
His response was : `` Shots were never fired . ''
Politics is about the redistribution of wealth , and I 'm not talking about communism .
Rich people distribute some wealth into campaigns .
Consultants distribute that money to themselves and highly skilled makers of crummy TV ads designed to keep people from voting .
After the election , the politicians redistribute your income , generally in the direction of the people who gave to them .
It 's what you might call a closed system .
It 's closed to you .
All politics is local , and probably more so than ever now that national politics is all spin and dirt , and nothing washes .

The ballot initiative supposedly was invented to bring citizens back into politics , but it 's just added a new and more distasteful meaning to the word `` proposition . ''
I like sitting in the bleachers of politics .
I try not to do endorsements .
But when it comes to propositions , I sometimes do disendorsements .
In California 's primary on Tuesday , please consider voting against Proposition 226 and Proposition 227 .
Proposition 226 is a trick to lock organized labor out of politics .
It would make unions get members ' individual permission to use their dues for campaign contributions , even though union leaders are democratically elected .
It further reduces the power of working people , and ultimately will redistribute income to the rich .
If Proposition 226 were at all fair , it would make shareholders sign off on corporate campaign contributions .
As for Proposition 227 , vote against it not because bilingual education in California is so wonderful , which it hasn n't been .
Vote against it because it 's an effort by one rich guy , Ron Unz , to tell parents , teachers and local schools what to do with children in the classroom .
Teachers can be held financially liable if they don n't follow Unz 's dictates about language .
Who made him language god ?
Politics is supposed to be entertaining .
It isn n't supposed to mess with kids ' minds .
