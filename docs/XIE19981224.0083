Egypt and Libya wrapped up Wednesday the two-day fourth session of the Policy Coordination and Advisory Committee , co-chaired by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his Libyan counterpart Omar Mustafa al-Montassir .
The committee is a forum for the two sides to coordinate stances on international and regional issues .

The United States and Britain have accused two Libyans of blasting the Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 over Lockerbie , Scotland , which killed 270 people .
