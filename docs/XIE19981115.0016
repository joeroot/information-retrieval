Vietnam Faces Power Shortage in 1998 - 99 Dry Season
HANOI , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Vietnam will face an estimated shortage of more than 400 million kwh ( kilowatt-hours ) of electricity in the 1998 - 99 dry season , double the figure it suffered during the previous dry season .
Vietnam News Agency quoted the Electricity of Vietnam ( EVN ) as saying that the shortage will seriously affect the country in late May and at the beginning of June next year .
Hydro-electricity makes up 70 percent of Vietnam 's total electricity output .
To ease the shortage , the EVN has been running all its thermal , gas and coal-fueled plants and stations to supply more power for the national grid and has spared no efforts to store water in reservoirs to serve the hydro-electric plants .
EVN produced 18 billion kwh of electricity in the first 10 months of this year and expects to raise the figure to 21.32 billion kwh for the whole year .
