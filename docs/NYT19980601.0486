SPORTS COLUMN : FOR DURAN , IT 'S A GARDEN OF MEMORIES

NEW YORK _ Nearly 100 fights and 27 years ago , Roberto Duran arrived in New York , a 20-year-old Panamanian lightweight with a 25 - 0 record and the sneering snarl of a Caribbean pirate in an old Errol Flynn movie .
All he needed to fit the part was a bandanna around his head and a knife between his teeth .
And in his Madison Square Garden debut on Sept. 13 , 1971 , all he needed to dispose of Benny Huertas was 70 seconds .
`` It was a dream for me to fight here , '' he said Monday with a soft smile that soon turned into that old sneer .
`` But when I walked around the city , nobody knew who I was .
I told myself , ` The next time I come here , they 're going to know me . '' '
The next time , he arrived as the challenger for the world lightweight title , then held by Ken Buchanan of Scotland .
`` I remember seeing Buchanan eating a piece of bread with butter and drinking a Coke , '' Duran recalled through Juan Rolon , his interpreter .
`` They asked him why he hadn n't looked at films of my fights and he said , ` Duran 's too slow for me . ' I started laughing inside .
I knew I was too tough for him . ''
Too tough and too rough .
He doubled up Buchanan with a low blow , took the title in the 13th round and everybody in boxing knew who Roberto Duran was .
They still do & UR ; , & LR ; and they always will .
He 'll be 47 years old in two weeks , but Saturday night he will go up the steps into the Garden ring again , this time with a 102 - 13 record , with 69 knockouts .
In his eighth Garden bout , he will try to dislodge the World Boxing Association middleweight title from William Joppy before Evander Holyfield defends his heavyweight title against Henry Akinwande .
`` I don n't want to talk a lot about Joppy , I want to show you , '' he said , sitting near the Garden ring in the exposition hall where he and other boxers will train this week .
`` But you can n't imagine the emotion I feel about being in the Garden . ''
On the peak of his cap were the weight classes he has won titles at : 135 , 147 , 154 and 160 .
Some boxing people think that , at 135 pounds , he was the best lightweight ever .
As a welterweight and middleweight , he has never had quite the same punch .
But of his seven Garden fights , he lost only one , a 10-round nontitle decision in 1972 to Esteban de Jesus , whom he knocked out twice in rematches .
He also outpointed Adolfo Viruet and knocked out Monroe Brooks in 1978 , outpointed Carlos Palomino in 1979 and stopped Davey Moore in 1983 .
`` Even a lot of people in my country didn n't think I would beat Moore , '' he said , `` but I did . ''
Three years earlier , some of those same people had scrawled `` Duran , Traitor '' on walls in Panama City after he had turned to the referee , muttered `` no mas '' and walked away from Sugar Ray Leonard in the seventh round in the Louisiana Superdome .
To him , Leonard had been clowning and taunting , not fighting .
But in winning the WBA junior-middleweight title from Moore and the World Boxing Council middleweight title from Iran Barkley in 1989 , Duran was an idol again in Panama , where he once punched out a horse .
`` My mother 's town , Guarare , every year they have a feast , '' he recalled .
`` I went there with $ 150 , a lot of money for me then .
My whole family was drinking whisky & UR ; , & LR ; and now I was down to about $ 30 .
Then this guy said , ` I 'll bet you a bottle of whisky and $ 50 you can n't knock out that horse over there . '
`` I looked at the horse and I thought , ` The horse has no jaw ; where am I going to hit him ? ' But my uncle , Socrates Garcia , told me : ` Hit him behind the ear .
If you hit him there , he will go down . ' I said , ` Somebody hold the money , ' then I walked over and hit the horse behind the ear and the horse went down . ''
`` I tore a hole in my hand , nothing broken , but it was bleeding , '' he said , holding out his right hand and pointing to the knuckle area .
`` My uncle wanted me to go to the hospital to bandage my right hand , but I had so many drinks in me , I didn n't feel the pain .
I stayed at the party . ''
But the horse isn n't why Roberto Duran is known as Manos de Piedras , meaning hands of stone .
`` I took a picture once with two rocks in my hands , '' he said .
`` That 's how that started . ''
Those hands aren n't what they used to be , but they will be throwing punches in the Garden again .
