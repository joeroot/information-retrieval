Lawyers ' Role Enhanced in Chinese Courts ( 2 )
Law experts share the view that all these major changes will lead to a greater demand for lawyers nationwide .
China 's contingent of lawyers has been expanding rapidly over the past few years .
Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that the number of Chinese lawyers surged to 170,000 at the end of 1997 , from 50,000 in 1992 .
China now has over 8,000 law firms , whose advocates defended 140,000 criminal cases in the first half of 1997 .
Xu Longchao , a lawyer with the Junhui Law Firm in Tianjin , said that the new Criminal Procedure Law has given Chinese lawyers more room to display their forensic skills .
" There are more confrontations and debates between the prosecutor and the defending attorney nowadays , as the judge has been placed outside the fray , " he said , adding that the defendants and their lawyers are now given more opportunities to make statements in court .
He also noted that judges are paying increasing attention to lawyers ' advice , and that he himself has successfully defended several clients .
Zhou Saijun , an official with the Ministry of Justice , pointed out that lawyers re-emerged in China only in 1979 , and that before the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Law , lawyers were denied access to both the defendants and their case files until seven days before the trial .
" The Law on Lawyers and the amended Criminal Procedure Law have laid a solid legal foundation for enhancing the role of defense attorneys , " he said .
" This is really another major example of progress in China 's human rights protection . "
