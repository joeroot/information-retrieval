Beijing Plans Nine Percent Growth Rate for 1999
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Beijing plans to score a nine percent growth in the gross domestic product for 1999 , according to vice-mayor Liu Qi .
The growth rate will be two percentage points higher than the country 's projected rate for 1999 , he said , adding that the new target is not only necessary but also attainable .
Beijing 's growth rate for this year is expected to reach 9.5 percent , exceeding the projected target by 0.5 percentage point .
He said without a relatively high growth rate , the city will have difficulty creating more jobs , increasing revenues and further improving people 's living standard .
Beijing will host a series major events in 1999 , including activities to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of New China and Macao 's return to the motherland .
Liu pointed out that such activities require a good economic environment but at the same time will create business opportunities .
He cited some other positive factors that can sustain the growth .
For example , the city will invest some 124.5 billion yuan in investment in fixed assets and will begin construction of 2.35 million square meters of housing .
The city also plans to export 2.7 billion US dollars worth of goods and introduce 2.5 billion dollars in foreign funds in the new year .
