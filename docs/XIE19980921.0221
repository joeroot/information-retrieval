NZ Dollar Forecast to Bottom Out in 2000
WELLINGTON , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The New Zealand dollar is forecast to " bottom out " at 47 U.S. cents in the year 2000 before recovering to about 53 U.S. cents in 2003 , according to the latest predictions of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research .
The New Zealand currency will continue to decline but at a slower pace , the local newspaper The Dominion Monday quoted the institute as saying .
The foreign exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar was 1 : 0.5078 last Friday .
Over the research group 's five-year forecasting period , the Kiwi dollar will stay fairly close to the Australian dollar , slipping back to 80 cents of the Australian dollar in the next two years before recovering slightly in the year 2000 .
Overall the New Zealand dollar will drift down a little against the Japanese yen , the institute said .
According to the institute , the trade-weighted index of New Zealand will fall steadily in the next two years but strengthen in 2001 as the current account finally improves .
The institute predicts the current account will be 3.4 percent of gross domestic product by March in 2002 from 7.2 percent in March this year .
Ninety-day wholesale interest rates have fallen 2.3 percent since June with the easing of monetary conditions .
The institute expects 90-day rates to start to rise in the year 2000 as the currency stabilizes and monetary conditions tighten .
