Indonesia Calls on OPEC to Meet Over oil Prices
JAKARTA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesia has called for an emergency OPEC ( the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) meeting to address decreasing oil prices .
The call was made by Minister of Mines and Energy L.B .
Sudjana on Thursday after meeting with President Soeharto , a local newspaper " The Jakarta Post " reported Friday .
Sudjana , who is also OPEC president , called for the meeting following a drop in oil prices this week .
World benchmark brent crude oil traded at 13.73 U.S. dollars per barrel on London 's International Petroleum Exchange Tuesday , the lowest level since April 1994 .
" I must take the initiative on this because of the oil price drop .
We should think together about the market developments .
If they ( OPEC ministers ) want to meet , we will look for a solution , " Sudjana said .
Some oil analysts blame the oversupply on OPEC which decided to raise its production ceiling to 27.5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) from 25.03 million bpd during its ministerial meeting last November in Jakarta .
But Sudjana said OPEC 's current production ceiling was not too high .
The weak oil price was because of lower demand , he added .
Sudjana said if OPEC ministers agreed to meet , the conference would be held in Vienna after Indonesia 's presidential election next month .
