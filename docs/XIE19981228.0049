Traffic Accident Explosion Kills 18 , Injures Nearly 100
HEFEI , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- A major explosion caused by a traffic accident Saturday afternoon claimed 18 lives and injured nearly 100 in Dingyuan County in east China 's Anhui Province , local authorities announced here today .
The accident took place on December 26 at around 3 : 00 pm at Zhongxin Village in Dingyuan County , some 65 kilometers from the provincial capital of Hefei , when a mini-bus carrying nine passengers crashed into a cargo van loaded with 60,000 detonators and 40,000 meters of fuse , according to the report of a local authority .
Both the mini-bus and the van caught fire after the crash , and the passengers ' calls for help brought rescue efforts from several hundred villagers and passers-by , who had no idea of the dangerous cargo aboard the van , said the report .
The volunteer rescuers managed to extinguish the fire on the bus with water , and helped the injured passengers to get out , but the fire on the van burned out of control after about 10 minutes .
While several dozen people gathered around the van , trying to push it away from the bus , a seriously injured man escaped from the burning cabin and told them about the explosives .
However , the blast occurred before everyone could escape , killing 17 on the spot and leaving some 100 others injured .
The report said the injured were rushed to a nearby hospital , where one seriously wounded victim died .
There are now 63 people still in the hospital undergoing further treatment ,
" There were many volunteers during the rescue efforts , " recalled Wang Zhennian , one of the injured rescuers still in hospital .
" We saw piles of paper boxes on the back of the van , but they had no marks or labels telling us what was inside . "
" If the survivor on the van had not fled to give warning , the casualties would surely have been much greater , " said Wang .
