Refugees Assimilated Into Zambian Society : UNHCR
LUSAKA , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Nearly 14,000 refugees in Zambia have been assimilated into the local society in the past years , according to a report obtained Monday from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) in Zambia .
These refugees who reside in urban areas of Zambia , mostly in capital Lusaka but also in the towns of the Copperbelt province , have been integrated into the Zambian society since they have been in the country for many years and have secured means to sustain themselves , said the report .
Currently , Zambia hosts some 167,000 refugees with the majority originating from Angola while others arrived in Zambia from such countries as the Democratic Republic of Congo , Rwanda , Burundi and Somalia .
The Zambian government only allows refugees to assimilate into the mainstream society if they could fend for themselves .
The UNHCR supports some of the refugees , who find it more difficult to assimilate , through skills training activities or the provision of micro-loans , to facilitate their economic self-reliance .
In its report , the U.N. refugee body hailed the Zambian government for upholding and protecting refugees ' basic human rights and maintaining an open door policy toward the victims of war , political and other forms of persecution .
