Ivanov Vows to Solve Problems With Azerbaijan
MOSCOW , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Wednesday that unsolved problems exist in relations with Azerbaijan , and that " some of them are serious . "
He said that Moscow will do its utmost " to resolve these problems , " Ivanov said after his talks with visiting Azeri Foreign Minister Tofik Zulfagarov .
Zulfagarov , who arrived here Tuesday on a working visit , called for " mutual understanding " in tackling such differences as in determining the legal status of the Caspian Sea .
He also expressed concern over Russia 's perceived expansion of military and technical ties with Armenia .
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been at odds over Nagorno-Karabakh , an enclave in Azerbaijan populated mainly by ethnic Azeris , who declared independence in 1991 .
Subsequent violence and war claimed about 15,000 lives .
Ivanov said the Russian-Armenian cooperation is based on international law and " is not aimed against Azerbaijan . "
Despite the differences , the two ministers agreed that their positions " on a number of issues " had been brought closer during the talks .
" Compromise is possible where our views differ , " Zulfagarov said .
