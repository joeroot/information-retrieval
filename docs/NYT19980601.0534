`` GENIUS GRANTS '' GO TO INTERNET INVENTOR , 28 OTHERS
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By SCOTT ALLEN c.1998 The Boston Globe
Four Massachusetts residents _ including the inventor of the Internet 's World Wide Web _ were among the 29 winners of prestigious `` genius grants '' from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation , the philanthropy announced Monday .
The MacArthur Fellowship grants , which range from $ 220,000 to $ 375,000 each , are like the Publishers ' Clearinghouse Sweepstakes for the very smart , given to unsuspecting intellectuals who have not applied for the money and rarely know they are under consideration .
Internet pioneer Timothy Berners-Lee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Brandeis University religion professor Bernadette Brooten , University of Massachusetts-Amherst , economist Nancy Folbre , and Karl Sims of Genetic Arts Inc. in Cambridge received surprise phone calls last week telling them they had won a fellowship .
`` It 's really a quest for the most extraordinary among us , '' said Daniel Socolow , director of the MacArthur Fellows Program .
`` People are doing the good things they are doing anyway .
This is a statement to them that , ` Congratulations , you 're doing a good job .
Keep it up . '' '
The Chicago-based philanthropy , with assets of about $ 4 billion , uses `` talent scouts '' to find prospective grant recipients in fields ranging from painting to law to biochemistry .
Since the unusual program began in 1991 , the foundation has given away $ 166 million to fellows , which they can spend as they choose .
Only California and New York had more MacArthur Fellows than Massachusetts this year , foundation officials said , and more than 50 of the 531 past and present grant winners now live in Massachusetts .
`` It 's a rich resource up there in the Northeast .
You 've got a lot of brainy people , '' said MacArthur spokesman Ted Hearne .
Berners-Lee , 43 and principal research scientist at MIT 's Laboratory for Computer Science , helped transform the Internet from a tool for computer experts to the world 's most powerful new information medium .
He developed the uniform resource locator system that allows Internet users to search for documents , and he set up the first web server to post information on the Internet .
Brooten , 47 , author of the book `` Love Between Women , '' uses Biblical texts and other ancient documents to contest church teaching against homosexuality .
Though Biblical-era writing inveighs against homosexuality , she argues that the texts use hateful terms and ideas that shouldn n't guide the modern church .
`` I want to persuade the Christian churches to rechannel their energies away from opposing lesbians , gay men , and bisexuals and toward preventing the sexual abuse of children and adults , '' said Brooten .
Nancy Folbre , 45 , of Montague said she expected to be rejected for an unrelated grant application when MacArthur Foundation president Adele Simmons told her she would receive $ 280,000 over the next five years .
`` She had a hard time talking about it .
She had a hard time even telling me about it '' because she was so surprised , said Folbre 's husband , Bob Dworak , who likened the call from Simmons to a visit from Ed McMahon of the Publishers ' Clearinghouse contest .
MacArthur officials said they were impressed with Folbre 's research into the work role of family members and the scarcity of `` caring labor '' to raise children , care for elders , and fill other non-market jobs .
Karl Sims , 36 , of Cambridge won for his work in using computers to simulate evolution and solve genetic problems .
Sims developed models that show how creatures evolve over time in response to their environment _ for instance , from a single-cell creature to a swimming fish .
Now , Sims runs Arts Images , a company that provides software for special effects in motion pictures .
The makers of `` Titanic '' used Sims ' software , which , among other things , can blank out the background for superimposing images .
