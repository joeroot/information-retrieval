AUSTIN , Texas _ In April , the country 's biggest meat-packing company recalled more than 282,000 pounds of ground beef after a virulent strain of E. coli bacteria was found in a package .
That same month , two children in Abilene and four in Greenville became ill with E. coli .
On Tuesday , in nearby Grayson County , a 33-year-old Denison man died from E. coli infection .
Public health officials have been working to rule out a connection among the cases _ one that would point to a common food source still endangering other people .
Coming to the epidemiologists ' aid is a new , nationwide early alert system for identifying E. coli 0157 : H7 , the bacterium that in 1993 killed four children and was traced to Jack in the Box restaurants .
`` We 're going to be able to act while the meat is still out there , '' said Virginia Headley , a public health bacteriology specialist for the Texas Department of Health .
`` By being able to get it off the market , we 'll be able to prevent cases .
That 's the ultimate goal -- to react in a quick enough time to make an impact . ''
The Texas Department of Health is one of 16 state labs participating in PulseNet , a computer database network linked to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta that can rapidly compare different strains of E. coli from different sources .
At its most deadly , E. coli causes bloody diarrhea and severe dehydration .
The system , unveiled by Vice President Al Gore in Washington last week , utilizes DNA fingerprints , which resemble bar codes .
Public health officials say the system , which will eventually incorporate other germs , such as shigella , which causes dysentery , and a common strain of salmonella , is an important defense against the growing threat of food-borne disease .
The medical sleuthing that once took months can be sped up to a matter of weeks -- or a few days .
`` We 'll be able to put things together in a lot less time than we were before , '' said David Maserang , bureau of laboratories chief at the Texas Department of Health , the first lab to go on line .
`` E. coli is a very dangerous organism .
Kills people .
Or physically affects them for the rest of their lives . ''
In the past , food-borne illness outbreaks were local events .
For example , everyone who ate potato salad at the office picnic became ill .
Today , with meat and produce companies distributing over large areas , contaminated food has the potential to make thousands of people sick all over the country .
Last summer , Hudson Foods Co. had to recall a record-breaking 25 million pounds of beef in 34 states after E. coli sickened people in Colorado .
Food-borne illness such as shigellosis can be spread with alarming ease .
Maserang cited the example of a food worker who fails to wash his hands after a trip to the bathroom .
Millions of shigella germs , invisible to the eye , cover his fingers .
He holds a potato , slices it , then tosses it into the potato salad where the germs , now on separate pieces of potato , continue to multiply and grow .
Using the contaminated knife and cutting board , he spreads the bacteria to the rest of the food he is preparing .
E. coli , found in cattle feces , can contaminate meat during the slaughtering process and be spread through grinding and packaging .
Thorough cooking kills the bacteria .
Officials estimate that food-borne illnesses -- such as E. coli , salmonella and others -- contribute to hundreds of deaths and millions of illnesses in the United States each year .
PulseNet , which originated in Texas , Massachusetts , Minnesota and Washington state , will eventually link agencies in all 50 states .
`` The biggest significance ( of PulseNet ) hinges on the fact we have such a huge network of food distribution in this country .
We don n't locally produce and consume our food , '' Headley said .
`` The animals are grown in one area ; they go someplace else for slaughter , another for grinding .
...
Trace-backs get real complicated .
When you have a large manufacturer of a product , it gets distributed quickly over a large portion of the United States . ''
Dr. Carolyn Fruthaler , director of the Grayson County Health Department in Denison , where the 33-year-old man died , welcomed the availability of PulseNet .
Right now , she knows of no contaminated food in her area , but she said she 's on high alert .
`` ( E.
coli ) has been connected to so many foodstuffs , it 's getting to be quite interesting and , in a way , scary .
Maybe cooking your meat all the way through isn n't going to be enough to protect you , '' she said .
`` ( PulseNet ) sounds like a wonderful tool that 's going to be very helpful when we do have outbreaks , '' she said .
`` If either one of ( the specimens ) comes back positive , we 'll be having to get the word out . ''
Of the six children struck in Abilene and Greenville , all have survived , although two are still in the hospital , said Brad Walsh , regional epidemiologist for Texas Department of Health in Arlington .
Three of the children suffered kidney failure in the course of their illness .
Thanks to DNA fingerprinting technology , Walsh said , he was able to rule out a connection between the Abilene and Greenville cases early on .
None of the cases appear to be related to the recent meat recall or the Denison death .
Walsh is still trying to figure out how the two families in Greenville -- who don n't know each other -- may have encountered the germ .
