AS BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN , D ' AMATO RAKES IN THE MONEY
( mk ) By CLIFFORD J. LEVY c.1998 N.Y .
Times News Service
NEW YORK _ The amendment was brief , so it attracted scant notice when Sen. Alfonse D ' Amato helped tuck it into a bill he was shepherding through the Senate as chairman of the Banking Committee .
But the provision , which weakened a consumer protection statute governing mortgages , was decidedly important to one company .
D ' Amato agreed to support the provision in late 1995 after lobbying by MBNA Corp. , one of the nation 's biggest issuers of credit cards .
MBNA is also one of the senator 's biggest benefactors , having channeled more than $ 500,000 in recent years to campaign committees that he leads .
Throughout his career , D ' Amato has been a tireless fund-raiser , a politician who works the phones with a barker 's gusto .
But since taking over the Banking Committee in 1995 , he has made his previous fund-raising seem almost pedestrian , harvesting millions of dollars from individuals and companies in the financial industry that , like MBNA , have a stake in legislation that as chairman he can control with a penstroke .
The money has not only filled D ' Amato 's Senate campaign account .
It has also enriched the New York Republican State Committee , strengthening the senator 's formidable political network and reinforcing his status as the state 's dominant Republican .
There is nothing unusual or illegal about members of Congress reeling in contributions from interests they oversee .
D ' Amato , though , has far exceeded the fund-raising of any other senator through his positions as chairman of the Banking Committee , which oversees much of the financial industry , and as a member of the Finance Committee , which governs tax legislation .
In MBNA 's case , D ' Amato has unsuccessfully supported the company 's efforts to revamp the consumer protection statute , which in most instances bars mortgage providers from paying fees to get referrals .
MBNA says the statute is hindering its expansion in the mortgage business , while consumer groups say lifting the ban would drive up the cost of buying a home .
But MBNA is not the only financial behemoth that has given heavily to D ' Amato .
Others _ including Travelers Group ; Bear , Stearns & AMP ; Co. ; Goldman , Sachs & AMP ; Co. , and Beneficial Corp. _ have also directed the kind of large sums to D ' Amato 's campaign committees that were once the sole province of the national parties .
Some have held private fund-raisers for D ' Amato .
`` That facilitated entre to the senator , '' said Dave Williams , chairman of Alliance Capital Management , referring to contributions to D ' Amato 's committees .
Alliance , a money management firm in New York City , held a fund-raiser for the senator last year as he was successfully sponsoring a proposal providing for a tax break that the firm wanted .
With the money from Wall Street and other financial companies fattening his Senate campaign account , D ' Amato has raised more than $ 17 million _ far more than any Senate candidate this year _ as he tries to overcome a strong Democratic challenge and win a fourth term .
He has nearly $ 11 million in the bank .
The only other congressional candidate in the nation who has even come close is a Democrat who wants his job , Rep. Charles Schumer of New York .
Schumer serves on the House Banking Committee and has also benefited from Wall Street 's largesse .
He has raised more than $ 10 million .
D ' Amato faced ethics inquiries over his ties to donors earlier in his career , but no serious wrongdoing was found .
He has not come under official scrutiny since he became chairman of the panel _ known as the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs _ which covers a broad swath of the nation 's economy , from banking and securities regulations to export controls to urban mass transit .
But some campaign finance experts say D ' Amato has a pattern of seeking money from companies with interest in Banking Committee business , knowing donors are unlikely to ignore the requests of a powerful legislator .
They contend that D ' Amato has used the Republican State Committee to accept big donations from the financial industry because the committee 's accounts are subject to little regulation .
D ' Amato declined to be interviewed about his fund raising .
His aides said he had become the biggest fund-raiser in Congress because donors were pleased by his stewardship of the Banking Committee and his overall record .
`` The senator is recognized as the most effective legislative voice in New York state because he gets things done for the people , '' said Lisette McSoud Mondello , a spokeswoman for D ' Amato .
`` Clearly , the people who contribute to Sen. D ' Amato support the principles of the senator , not the other way around . ''
In recent years , D ' Amato has been in a prime position to collect donations since the the financial industry has been undergoing rapid changes , with some companies seeking the overhaul of decades-old regulations , and others lobbying to keep them in place .
For example , D ' Amato recently scheduled hearings on long-stalled legislation that would do away with Depression-era regulations that have stymied many mergers between banks , securities firms and insurance companies .
The senator called for the hearings after meeting with three prominent Wall Street executives , including Sanford Weill , chairman of Travelers Group , which would have great difficulty completing its huge merger with Citicorp if such legislation is not approved .
Travelers and its subsidiaries have given more than $ 375,000 to committees controlled by D ' Amato in recent years , including $ 190,000 to the New York Republican State Committee .
`` There is no doubt that Sen. D ' Amato has capitalized on his very powerful position to raise money from very wealthy sources , '' said Jennifer Shecter , a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington .
`` The bottom line is that Al D ' Amato is in the catbird seat when it comes to fund raising .
The special interests who care about legislation that comes before his committee are usually the ones with the most giving power . ''
D ' Amato has also received large contributions from donors with interest in legislation before the Finance Committee , which oversees most tax and health-care policy .

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS )
Last year , he successfully pushed a proposal through the Finance Committee that granted a tax break to a group of limited partnerships .
D ' Amato 's campaign committees have received more than $ 200,000 from donors connected to the limited partnerships , records show .
One of those firms , Alliance Capital Management , raised about $ 40,000 for the senator , both through a fundraiser and donations from the firm 's executives .
Williams , the firm 's chairman , has contributed $ 63,000 to the Republican State Committee in the last two years , including $ 13,000 as he was lobbying D ' Amato on the tax break .
Alliance 's parent , Equitable Cos. , gave $ 6,000 to the state party at the time of the lobbying , and another $ 25,000 later in 1997 , records show .
Asked about a connection between the donations and the legislation , Ms. Mondello , D ' Amato 's spokewoman , said , `` That 's just nonsense . ''
`` Sen. D ' Amato is always fighting for New Yorkers and New York companies , '' she said .
It is D ' Amato 's position on the Banking Committee , though , that is perhaps his most potent lure as a fund-raiser .
Most of the Senate bills of interest to MBNA , for example , go before the Banking Committee , according to lobbying records .
Over the last four years , D ' Amato 's Senate campaign has received more than $ 220,000 from MBNA 's political action committee , its executives and the executives ' family members , according to disclosure records .
The donations from the executives and their families came after MBNA ran a fund-raising drive for D ' Amato , sending memos throughout the company asking for contributions .
MBNA , which is based in Wilmington , Del. , has given $ 170,000 to the New York Republican State Committee .
The company and its PAC gave $ 127,500 to the National Republican senatorial Committee when D ' Amato was its chairman in 1995 and 1996 .
MBNA 's donations to this committee dropped sharply after another senator became its chairman in 1997 , records show .
Finally , the company gave another $ 5,000 to a state political action committee controlled by the senator .
David Spartin , an MBNA vice chairman , said `` there is no connection between any campaign contributions and any piece of legislation .
We support good government . ''
The relationship goes beyond Senate business .
Last year , D ' Amato attended a ceremony at Columbia University honoring the company 's chairman , Alfred Lerner , where the senator made remarks praising Lerner .
The mortgage law that MBNA has sought to revise generally bans mortgage providers from paying fees to real estate agents for referring business to them .
D ' Amato said at a hearing last year that the law has `` restricted the growth of the new marketing systems for mortgage products . ''
He said scaling back the law could lower the cost of mortages `` and help make the dream of home ownership available to more Americans . ''
Consumer groups fear that if mortgage companies are allowed to pay fees for referrals , it could lead to customers being steered to more expensive mortage products .
MBNA wants an amendment to the law that would allow it to pay fees to so-called affinity groups _ such as alumni associations _ for referrals .
MBNA has specialized in issuing credit cards through affinity groups , and it wants to use those relations to expand its mortgage business .
MBNA first obtained the support of two Republicans on the Banking Committee who were sponsoring a bill to scale back some banking regulations .
But the key backing came from D ' Amato , who was a co-sponsor of the bill and as chairman can control amendments to it .
Also lobbying for the measure was another major credit card company , Household International , which has given more than $ 100,000 to D ' Amato 's committees .
In late 1996 , the provision came under attack from consumer groups , Democratic senators and the White House .
Other mortgage providers joined them , saying that while the statute needed to be revamped , the amendment was biased toward credit card companies .
Several lobbyists and Senate staff members who worked on the legislation recalled that D ' Amato fought fiercely for the provision .
`` Sen. D ' Amato was really the force behind it , '' said one lobbyist , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
But faced with opposition from the White House , D ' Amato and the other Republican senators dropped the provision .
`` D ' Amato 's people really held out for a long time '' in the negotiations , said another person who worked on the legislation .
Ms. Mondello denied that D ' Amato was a staunch backer of the provision .
`` He supported it , but never fought for it , '' she said .
A new version of the provision is in a bill that is now before the Banking Committee and is being co-sponsored by D ' Amato .
