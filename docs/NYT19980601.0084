& HT ; Gingrich no statesman on Middle East & HT ; By Martha Ezzard & HT ; c.
1998 Cox News Service
ATLANTA _ Sooner or later , Madeleine Albright , the first female secretary of state , was bound to have a public brush with chauvinism .
Surely there was a touch of it in the comments of House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga . ) when he declared for the benefit of the world _ and especially Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu _ that Albright was nothing more than an `` agent of the Palestinians . ''
Can anyone imagine Gingrich saying that about Henry Kissinger , George Shultz , James Baker III , Warren Christopher ?
The historical myth that prevented women from serving in high foreign-policy positions is that they would be too easily influenced , too weak .
It was a gender thing .
Aside from picking on Albright , Gingrich , the history professor , knows the first lesson of statesmanship is to share foreign policy concerns of a delicate nature with the secretary or the president privately .
But Gingrich hardly qualifies for the list of Georgians in Congress who have distinguished themselves on foreign policy : Sen. Walter George , who won high praise from President Dwight D. Eisenhower for his bipartisan approach ; Sens. Richard Russell and Sam Nunn , for instance , both of whom advised Republican and Democratic presidents .
Gingrich claims to have learned a number of lessons the hard way in his book , '' Lessons Learned . ''
Now we all know one lesson he didn n't learn .
He might have taken a cue from respected GOP colleagues , Sen. Bob Dole and former President George Bush .
Bush once declared he would never oppose openly the foreign policy of a seated president .
He never has .
And Dole won Democratic kudos on numerous occasions for his bipartisan approach , most recently when he supported President Clinton in retaining U.S. troops in Bosnia past a prior congressional deadline .
Gingrich has left himself open to speculation that he had an even more troubling motive for publicly bashing U.S. policy in the Middle East at a delicate time for reviving peace negotiations : fund raising back home .
The pro-Israeli Political Action Committees are no small campaign donors , funneling millions each year into candidate and party coffers .
Federal candidates in both parties make command appearances before the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee , the powerful pro-Israel lobbying force that alerts a network of Jewish PACs about politicians ' remarks and votes .
Those PACs are such a well-established part of Washington fund raising that despite recent concerns about the illegal money influence on American foreign policy , no one seems to care about the `` legal '' PAC influences .
Gingrich 's latest candidate disclosure reports reflect almost no contributions from pro-Israel PACS , though his separate `` Monday Morning PAC , '' from which he assists other GOP candidates , has collected some pro-Israel money .
( The pro-Israel PACs are difficult to identify in campaign filings because , like other interest groups , they have neutral names : `` Washington PAC '' and `` Americans for Good Government , '' for example . )
Historically , Democrats have collected more money from Jewish PACs than have Republicans .
Maybe Gingrich will change that , but he isn n't likely to change his image as the ultimate partisan to the kind of statesman Americans prefer in high office .
