FALLING IN LOVE WITH BEANIE BABIES
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By ADRIENNE FREEMAN and SHARON OKADA c.1998 Albany Times Union
ALBANY , N.Y .
_ Collecting Beanie Babies _ the little stuffed animals that made their debut in 1994 and now sell in the millions _ has become a phenomenon notable for its appeal to adults .
Two moms share the hold Beanie Babies have on them , and offer a glimpse into the local Beanie Baby network that is tuned in to all things Beanie :
Yes , we confess .
We are Beanieholics , adults obsessed with bagging that new , overlooked , coveted bit of plush out there for under $ 7.
We are not serious collectors , just part of the crowd bitten by the Beanie bug .
But lately , we 're noticing our tales of Beanie pursuits are being greeted by the rolling of eyes instead of enthusiasm .
Our children are starting to worry about us .
Our co-workers wonder what powerful substance , possibly embedded in the plastic pellets or `` beans '' stuffed inside these creatures , keeps us continuously on the hunt .
Our Beanie information is gleaned on-line , by word of mouth , and via an informal telephone network of the similarly obsessed .
We also make phone calls to favorite retailers , although this now frequently means listening to recorded messages on Beanie availability .
Store owners , often the only staff at the small shops that typically sell Beanie Babies , say they can no longer spend the time to personally answer what can be hundreds of Beanie calls they receive each day .
Ty Inc. , the manufacturer of Beanie Babies , has printed its popular Web site address right on the heart-shaped `` hang tag '' that has accompanied all Beanies since their introduction in 1994 .
Our on-line forays add to the 1.6 billion hits the ty.com Beanie Baby Web site has received .
This number is constantly updated at the top of the Web site , like the McDonald 's signs of years past .
We 've completed the on-line Beanie Baby survey on the beaniemom.com site and have discovered that even our enthusiasm for Beanie Babies pales next to others .
Two hundred and fifty six respondents admitted to following UPS trucks and personnel in their pursuit of Beanies .
Six hundred and two checked `` Beanies are my primary vocation . ''
We 're glad we haven n't lost it that much .
We have bought ( literally ) into Ty 's brilliant marketing strategy of maintaining interest in the Beanie collection by periodically , via the Web and their vendors , announcing the `` retirement '' of batches of Beanies .
This results in Beanie `` hunters '' snatching up any remaining `` retirees . ''
Ty then announces the introduction of new `` species '' ( type of Beanie Baby ) as they go into production .
These new ones are then not available to the public for a few months , resulting in a Beanie frenzy as UPS shipments of them trickle into stores .
Since Ty does not sell its products to large retailers like Toys R Us , bypassing them to sell to smaller toy and gift retailers , Beanie Babies have been a real boon to these businesses .
Small shops that have sold Ty products long before the Beanie craze also get preference when it comes to shipments of limited release Beanies .
The Beanie craze also has spawned a thriving resale or secondary market .
Entrepreneurs in malls , Beanie shows , and on the Web resell Beanies for as much as the market will bear .
The high prices some retired Beanies are fetching is based on rarity .
Collectors are willing to pay as much as $ 5,200 for a Peanut the Royal Blue Elephant because only 2,000 were made in 1995 , before the fabric was changed to the more available light blue .
We long ago gave up on putting together a complete collection of 53 currents and 118 retirees ( including the 28 retired on May 1 ) .
But , like dreaming of winning the lottery , we still pursue the total Beanie deal .
A hobby that started as gift-buying for kids , nieces and friends has changed into something not quite controllable , and even a little ridiculous , but still fun , in a deliciously guilty sort of way .
