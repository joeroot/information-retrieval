IOM to Discuss Impact of Migration on AIDS
GENEVA , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV / AIDS ( UNAIDS ) will hold a two-day meeting here next Monday to discuss the impact of migration on the spread of HIV / AIDS and of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) .
Representatives of concerned international agencies and independent experts will look into the results of an IOM / UNAIDS joint review of the current knowledge , policy and research on the impact of migration on HIV / AIDS / STD .
It is estimated that over 30 million people are living with HIV / AIDS , and over 90 percent are in the developing countries .
One of the key contributory factors to the rapid spread of HIV in many parts of the world is migration , the IOM stated on Friday .
There are more than 50 million people worldwide who are either refugees , displaced persons or migrants , it added .
" The unsettled lifestyle of these people , the disruption of their family lives and stable relationships , and the loosening of traditional social controls on their behavior mean that they become particularly vulnerable to HIV infection , " it said .
The IOM stressed that this situation is compounded by the fact that many do not have ready access to health and social services in their new environments .
UNAIDS is jointly sponsored by the United Nations Children 's Fund , the United Nations Development Program , the United Nations Population Fund , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , the World Health Organization , and the World Bank .
