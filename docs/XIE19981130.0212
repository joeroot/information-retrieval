China 's Shoe Manufacturers Facing Serious Challenges
BEIJING , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's shoe industry , one of the world 's largest , is now facing serious challenges in a more competitive market as well as from its large capacity , and analysts are calling for a new round of changes .
Since the late 1980s , China has imported a large amount of production equipment that made the industry grow rapidly .
According to the State Statistics Bureau , China produced more than 6.29 billion pairs of shoes last year , about four times the 1985 figure .
Nearly half of those were sold abroad .
But in recent years , more shoe manufacturers have had market problems , leaving some 300 million pairs of leather shoes in warehouses .
By the end of 1997 , even the best manufacturers had to operate at least 50 percent under capacity .
Analysts attribute this partly to a lack of variety and disorderly competition between manufacturers and dealers and say that manufacturers should improve their product line to meet international demand , and should replace imported materials with domestic materials to cut costs , while looking for new overseas markets .
A major part of Chinese shoes are made with imported materials for re-export worth of 5.78 billion U.S. dollars each year .
