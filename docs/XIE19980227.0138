Carlos Lopes , director of the Macao Posts and Telecommunications Department , told a press conference Friday that the gross income from stamp sales last year was estimated at more than 150 million patacas ( 18.75 million U.S. dollars ) , more than double the figure in 1996 .
He said further accounting is being conducted and final figure will not be available until the end of March .
Along with the fever for Hong Kong stamps around the handover of Hong Kong , Macao stamps also turned out to be hot pieces for many collectors in China 's inland , Hong Kong and local Macao .
In the peak period , buyers queued up for hours to buy just two sets of new stamps .
Vendors sometimes immediately sold the newly-bought stamps at double prices .
Macao last year issued 13 sets of stamps , each at less than two million pieces .
Most stamps feature traditional Chinese customs , well-known Macao buildings or typical Macao costumes .
A set of new stamps featuring Macao gateways will be issued Sunday .
