MEMPHIS , Tenn. _ Three years ago , Daira Hodges was a 14-year-old ninth-grader and honor student who lived with her family in a middle-class suburb .
`` I thought everything was a utopia , '' she said recently , `` I mean , to me , the next-best place to be besides home was school . ''
After May 9 , 1995 , she would never see her world that way again .
Just after lunch that day , a former boyfriend of hers , also 14 , dragged Ms. Hodges into a vacant classroom of their academically renowned junior high school and choked her until she passed out .
He then stabbed her 21 times , left her for dead and went to take an algebra test .
But she regained consciousness more than an hour after the attack .
Despite the bleeding and weakness , she managed to make her way into the hall , where a classmate saw her .
She spent a month in the hospital , including two weeks in an intensive-care unit , before she was able to go home .
But Ms. Hodges did more than survive .
On Wednesday , she will graduate from East High School as the valedictorian of her class .
This fall , she will begin working toward a premed degree at Vanderbilt University in Nashville .
She wants to be a gynecologist .
She is a joyful , poised and confident 17-year-old , but she is not unaffected by her experience .
`` Before this happened , '' said Ms. Hodges , `` if I cried , it was because something happened to a dog .
Maybe I was in a fantasy world .
But this opened my eyes .
Now I know violence is out there and it always will be . ''
She felt a connection to the victims of the recent school shootings in nearby Jonesboro , Ark. , Pearl , Miss. , and West Paducah , Ky. , and to the one last month in Springfield , Ore. `` I know what their families will go through , '' she said .
Ms. Hodges had to recover from a punctured liver , and she had her gall bladder removed .
She had so many stab wounds on her neck that she could not speak for a while .
And scars remain all over her body .
`` I didn n't want to see myself in a mirror for a long time , '' she said , `` I remember thinking , ` I 'm not cute anymore . '' ' She hopes to get plastic surgery someday .
Ms. Hodges ' mother , Jacquelyne Hodges , 38 , a toxicology lab assistant , said , `` That summer right after it happened , there was no way my baby was going anywhere alone .
I was paranoid . ''
Ms. Hodges and her family credit open lines of family communication and their deep religious faith with guiding them through the ordeal .
`` After a while , I saw that I couldn n't always be there to protect Daira , '' Mrs. Hodges said .
`` I 'm still apprehensive , but at the same time I realize that she can n't go through life hiding . ''
A year after the attack , Ms. Hodges attended a summer academic program at Choate Rosemary Hall , a private school in Connecticut .
This spring , she was honored by the Children 's Defense Fund as part of their Beat The Odds program .
Her mother , worried that her daughter would never trust men , has been glad to see Daira dating again .

Ms. Hodges ' former boyfriend came from a two-parent home in the same middle-class section of Memphis as she did .
He had been a Boy Scout , an honor student , a junior minister at his church and a football player who worked on the school newspaper and sang in the school choir .
She had known him since fourth grade .
They broke up two weeks before the stabbing , and she thought they had remained friends .
Cary Woods , an assistant district attorney in the Memphis Juvenile Division , who first prosecuted Ms. Hodges ' case said , `` He was the first to fit the profile of a new breed of juvenile defendant we are seeing more often now , who are smarter than usual and have a lot going for them . ''
The teen-ager claimed he was set up by a gang member but in December 1995 , a jury convicted him of attempted second-degree murder .
Because he was a juvenile when he committed the attack , he can remain in state custody only until he is 19 years old .
At the time , state law did not allow juveniles to be tried as adults on attempted-murder charges .
That loophole has been closed , but the old law still applies to him .
Now he is 17 , and in a step-down program where he is being allowed to work part-time at a grocery store in Memphis .
He hopes to go to college one day .
Ms. Hodges ' father , Daryl Hodges , 40 , manager of a franchiser of 50 McDonald 's in Memphis , said : `` The system was disappointing .
Minors get exceptions and they take advantage of it . ''
Despite her triumphs , Ms. Hodges is troubled that what happened to her might have marked the start of a new era of brutal school violence .
`` In my case , it was a young black man who did this , so people didn n't pay as much attention .
Then white people started doing it .
Now I think people are seeing that it can happen anywhere . ''
