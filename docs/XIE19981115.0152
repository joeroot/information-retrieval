Low Expectations for Indonesian Athletic Success in Asiad
JAKARTA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- With 125 Indonesian athletes taking part in the upcoming Asian Games in Bangkok next month , sports authorities have voiced their satisfaction with a haul of only six gold medals , the Indonesian Observer reported Sunday .
Assuming that the national sports development organization has maintained a badminton team with the same high standards that won three golds in the Hiroshima Asian Games four years ago , these medals should remain safely in Indonesian hands in December .
The anticipated golds are expected to include two in the badminton events and another four , each from the karate , taekwondo , weightlifting and tennis competitions .
Given Indonesia 's past record at the Hiroshima Asian Games , where the nation 's athletes took three gold , 12 silver and 11 bronze medals , the new target of six golds is predicted to be a reasonably realistic task .
However , considering the high level of competition the sportsmen and women will be facing at the games , the anticipated results are not a forgone conclusion .
Indonesia will certainly have to struggle to meet its target of six golds , let alone bidding for nine , and a number of the country 's athletes have even predicted a figure far lower than that announced officially .
M.F .
Siregar , a former official on Indonesia 's sport governing body ( KONI ) , said it would be " good " if Indonesia could manage three golds , and " excellent " if it could get four .
Such lowly predictions follow from the ongoing monetary crisis which has adversely intervened during the team preparations .
The soaring U.S. dollar has prompted KONI to tighten its budget , effecting the training programs of most of the country 's sports federations .
Indonesia may be the dominant nation at the Southeast Asian Games , the paper said , but it has yet to seriously challenge top athletes from other Asian nations and since its best ever performance in the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta , it has consistently struggled .
In the Asian Games in Seoul , the Indonesian contingent could only carry one tennis gold , four silver and 11 bronze medals .
Four years later in Beijing , Indonesian athletes improved their haul to three golds in tennis and boxing , with six silvers and 22 bronzes .
During the upcoming Asian Games , Indonesia will be fighting to maintain its three gold medals , won at the Hiroshima Games .
