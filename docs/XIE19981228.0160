Nepal 's New Ministers Sworn In
KATHMANDU , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Ten newly appointed ministers were sworn in Monday , bringing into operation Nepal 's new tripartite government designed for general elections by March / April 1999 .
In the presence of King Birendra , Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala administered the oath of office to the ministers appointed last Friday , a notice issued by the king 's Principal Press Secretariat said .
Under an agreement reached between the Nepali Congress ( NC ) and the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxism-Leninism , CPN-UML ) , the two major ruling partners , the objective of the coalition is to conduct free , fair and impartial elections .
The 11-member cabinet comprising the NC , the CPN-UML and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party is expected to be expanded later for the inclusion of other parties wishing to enter in the spirit of an all-party government for the elections .
The government , the sixth since the mid-term polls in November 1994 , was formed following the collapse of the coalition between the NC and the Communist Party of Nepal ( Marxism-Leninism , CPN-ML ) .
The CPN-ML pulled out on December 10 after sharing power with the NC for three and a half months .
It alleged that the NC had failed to abide by the agreements reached with it and other left parties in August .
On December 20 , the NC and the CPN-UML agreed to form an all-party government for conducting " free , fair and impartial elections " by March / April 1999 .
The exact date is expected to be decided by the cabinet .
