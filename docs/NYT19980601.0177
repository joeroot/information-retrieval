` ALMOST ' DOESN ' T EVEN COME CLOSE
HEROES-TEX ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By ROBERT PHILPOT c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
In the very first scene of `` Almost Heroes , '' Chris Farley is on the gallows , telling the crowd what it can do with his fat rump .
Not only is the scene a creepy reminder of his recent death , it 's a reminder of how he lived his life : not caring much what anyone thought of him , and willing to do anything for a laugh .
Too often , Farley did the most extreme things for a laugh .
His philosophy seemed to be that no matter how lame the line , bellowing it would make it funny ; no matter how weak the sight gag , if Farley screamed and abused himself enough , maybe you 'd at least crack a smile .
Farley does a lot of bellowing and screaming in `` Almost Heroes , '' but nobody could have saved this script , written by a trio whose names don n't merit looking up .
Although a few laughs come through , this story of a cut-rate Lewis and Clark ultimately defeats normally dependable talents , including Matthew Perry and Eugene Levy , with its disjointed gags and aimless story .
But it 's director Christopher Guest who suffers the biggest defeat .
Less than a year after his `` Waiting for Guffman '' made some of 1997's 10-best lists , he 's delivered a movie that 's a good bet for 1998's 10-worst lists .
Maybe Guest needs to write his own material when he directs ; whatever the case , he winds up with a movie about cross-country exploration in which everyone in the cast seems to be going in a separate direction , and nothing seems to click .
Despite Farley 's bluster , he changes pace somewhat with his role as Bartholomew Hunt , the slovenly 19th - century explorer who teams up with the effete Leslie Edwards ( Perry ) to lead a ragtag band toward the Pacific Northwest .
Most of Farley 's earlier movie characters were innocent doofuses , but Hunt knows his way through the wilderness ; he just suffers a lot of indignities in finding it .
But the change of character doesn n't make for much of a change in the performance , and the gallows opening isn n't the only reminder of Farley 's demise .
He doesn n't really play well off Perry , but then Perry seems uncomfortable throughout , throwing out his usual engaging cleverness in favor of a pomposity that never really finds the right note .
Call it the `` Friends '' curse _ like his cast mates David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston , who also made bad movies this year , he seems forever doomed to play his TV persona .
But hey , he 's well-paid for it ; we should all be so doomed .
Levy , as a maniacal French interpreter , and Kevin Dunn , as a ruthless conquistador , do what they can to breathe life into things , but all their performances amount to is huffing and puffing ; Bokeem Woodbine , Lisa Barbuscia and Fort Worth 's Patrick Cranshaw are wasted in supporting roles that are all set-up and no payoff .
But then , the whole movie is a bit of waste _ a fitful struggle for laughs with a terrible ending .
Kind of like Farley 's life .
