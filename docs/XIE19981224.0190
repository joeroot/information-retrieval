Colombian Rebels Reject Christmas Truce
BOGOTA , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- A Colombian leftist rebel group on Wednesday rejected a Christmas truce , accusing the army and pro-government paramilitary group of not joining the ceasefire .
The National Liberation Army , or ELN , Colombia 's second l argest guerrilla group , said in a statement that there were " no conditions " for the truce since " the ceasefire should include all the players . "
On the eve of peace talks with the country 's major rebel groups , President Andres Pastrana 's government had called for an end-of-the-year ceasefire .
The country 's largest rebel movement , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) and a smaller group , the People 's Liberation Army ( EPL ) had accepted the truce .
Colombia 's United Self-Defense forces , an umbrella organization for paramilitary groups , announced in recent weeks it would stop fighting between December 20 and the first week of January .
