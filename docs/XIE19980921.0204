Swedish Ruling Party Vows to Rule on Despite Lower Support
STOCKHOLM , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Sweden 's ruling Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , reeling from its worst setback since 1922 in the weekend general election , has vowed to rule on by seeking support from other parties .
According to official results , the SDP led with 131 seats in the 349-member Riksdag parliament with just 36.6 percent of the votes , far short of the majority needed to govern alone .
The figure , 30 seats less than what the SPD won in 1994 , marked the poorest performance by Social Democrats in their 75-year history .
Prime Minister Goran Persson , after the announcement of the election result , said the SPD " will continue to govern " but he planned to negotiate with possible partners on forming a cabinet .
" The new situation might be that we must need the support of two other parties , for which we are not unprepared , " he said .
The left wing of the Riksdag , consisting of the SDP , the Left party and the environmentalist Green party , retained the majority with a total of 190 seats .
The Leftists won 43 seats or 12 percent and become the third largest party in the country while the Green party won 4.4 percent and 16 seats .
The opposition right wing got 159 seats and 44.3 percent of the votes .
The Moderates won 22.6 percent and 81 seats ( up one ) , the Centralists 5.2 percent and 19 seats ( down eight ) , the Liberals 4.7 percent and 17 seats ( down nine ) while the Christian Democrats won 11.8 percent and 42 seats ( up 15 ) to become the fourth largest party .
The election turnout was reported to be 80.3 percent .
