Canadian Casinos Get Anti-Cash-Laundering Rules
OTTAWA , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Canadian Casinos will be required from October 16 to keep records on people who spend or win more than 10,000 Canadian dollars ( 6,600 U.S. dollars ) , the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday .
The requirement is one of several changes to regulations aimed at preventing money laundering .
The government has spent more than a year drafting the changes , which were released last week , as a way of tackling the growing problem of money laundering .
The Solicitor-General 's Office estimates that up to 17 billion Canadian dollars ( 11.2 billion U.S. dollars ) are laundered in Canada every year .
Until now , only banks and some other financial institutions have been required to keep records of large transactions in Canada .
The new rules will require casinos to keep the name , address , phone number and occupation of anyone involved in a transaction worth 10,000 Canadian dollars or more in one day .
If a casino extends credit to a customer beyond 2,500 Canadian dollars ( 1,650 U.S. dollars ) , it must also record the same personal information , the regulations say .
The records must be kept for five years .
Casinos are a big business in Canada , and they operate in nearly every province .
