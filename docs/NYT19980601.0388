WYNALDA MATURES INTO POWERFUL SOCCER FORCE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By JILL R. DORSON c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
SAN FRANCISCO _ Eric Wynalda grew up in the 1970s in a Southern California town where boys played ball in the streets and parents sent their children into the community to test their mettle .
Yet Eric Wynalda was scared .
As the story goes , Dave and Sue Wynalda 's middle child went to the drugstore in Westlake Village with his brother Brandt to buy some candy .
But the slight boy who would become one of the most recognizable names in his sport was unable to make a purchase .
`` Brandt ( Wynalda 's older brother ) made his purchase and left the store , but Eric was kind of hanging back , '' Dave Wynalda said .
`` Brandt went to see what was going on and Eric whispered in his ear and Brandt made his purchase because Eric was too shy . ''
Many years later , Eric Wynalda overcame that shyness on a global stage .
Before an international television audience , before tens of thousands of fans , a long way from the cocoon of Westlake Village , Wynalda was so bold in World Cup ' 90 in Italy that he threw an elbow and became the first U.S. player ever to get ejected from a World Cup .
`` That 's what gives people the wrong impression , '' Wynalda said .
`` I did that in 1990 and it was a world-scale nightmare .
I became all the things that people thought I was and I 'm still living with that . ''
When the U.S. men 's national soccer team opens World Cup ' 98 June 15 against Germany in Paris , Wynalda will be on stage again .
But this time , Wynalda , among the most celebrated players in U.S. soccer history , will be trying to make a different kind of statement .
America 's all-time leading goal scorer is haunted by that most embarrassing , defining moment .
Since that incident , Wynalda has grown from upstart forward for a fledgling U.S. team to veteran goal scorer _ 32 international goals in all _ for a team that hopes to break into soccer 's elite by advancing to the second round of the Cup .
And Wynalda 's hope is to change the image he so carelessly created eight years ago .
`` I 'll live with that for the rest of my life , '' Wynalda said .
`` But I think it 's one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me because it taught me so much about myself .
Maybe I wasn n't ready for that and I needed to handle it differently .
I created that situation with my attitude , I 'm a target now . ''
Wynalda is known as the brash bad boy of his sport .
On a basketball court , Eric Wynalda 's counterpart is Charles Barkley .
On the baseball diamond , it is Albert Belle .
They are players known as much for temperament as talent , defined more by their miscues than their triumphs .
`` He 's an enigma , '' said Brian Quinn , coach of Wynalda 's MLS team , the Clash .
`` He 's such a diverse personality .
He 's serious , smart , funny , bright , impatient .
...
But the maturity shows on the field , he doesn n't get rattled as easily .
Before he would have said , ` Screw you ' and lashed out .
But now , he is more patient . ''
Wynalda 's growth is borne out by his tempered persona on the field , his decision to forgo a second chance to play soccer in Germany so he could be in the United States to focus on the World Cup , and his desire to give back to the game .
To those closest to him , Eric Wynalda has become a leader , an advocate , a teacher and a man .
`` People compare him to Barkley or ( Dennis ) Rodman , but how many kids can go and touch Barkley after a game ? ''
said Eric 's wife , Amy .
Soccer , as Dave and Sue Wynalda tell it , saved their son .
Before the game fell into their lives , Wynalda was prone to tantrums and trouble .
`` He would just stand there with his hands on hips and just kick things , '' Sue Wynalda said .
`` He was just terrible . ''
But one day , when Eric was 5 , he went to watch Brandt play soccer .
The kid absorbed the game , the strategy , the atmosphere .
He may not have known then what he could become , but he certainly knew that he had found his way .
`` Who would have thunk it ? ''
asked Dave Wynalda .
`` I 'm serious , you can n't make a soccer player like this .
But we have this saying in our family , that God touches every one of us with genius .
Eric found his in soccer . ''
