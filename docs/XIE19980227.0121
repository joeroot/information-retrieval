Government Builds Closer Ties with Think Tank
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- China 's top decision makers have formed closer ties with their major think tank , the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) .
Ru Xin , vice-president of CASS , told an academy information work meeting here today that its scholars submitted hundreds of reports last year to the central government concerning urgent issues , including the return of Hong Kong to the motherland , the financial situation , reform of state enterprises , Sino-US summit talks and the environment .
Chinese leaders have studied the reports , giving instructions concerning many of them , and government departments have been applying CASS ' research findings in their practical work .
" These reports touched on a variety of subjects and provided fresh ideas for policy makers , " said an official in charge of information work at the State Council .
Ru said that the researchers always make the fullest investigations before submitting their reports , which are characterized by independence of thinking .
He added that an electronic information channel is to be set up between CASS and the central government .
In the past , Chinese officials ' ignorance of experts ' suggestions resulted in great losses , he noted , adding that it was only after the debut of the reform and opening policies 18 years ago that officials began to pay attention to scholars ' research findings .
Deputies to the National People 's Congress have repeatedly called for the establishment of more think tanks to help them cope with complicated situations .
Late senior leader Deng Xiaoping was said to have considered a sociologist 's opinions before introducing reforms to the rural areas , according to Ru .
Jiang Zemin and other top leaders now always pay close attention to social science researchers ' opinions before making important decisions , he added .
In addition to CASS , think tanks have been created in the Chinese Academy of Sciences , and in several ministries and commissions of the State Council .
