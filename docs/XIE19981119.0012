Greece Criticizes Turkey for Ocalan Affair
ATHENS , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Greece Wednesday reacted sharply to Turkey 's threat , saying that the Turkish claims were rejected as " unfounded and groundless . "
Turkey Tuesday accused Athens of supporting the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) and its leader , Abdullah Ocalan , and threatened that Athens was " playing with fire . "
In a statement released Wednesday , Greek Foreign Ministry said that Greece had condemned terrorism from wherever it might originate and had categorically stated to the Turkish side at the highest level that it had not provided any support whatsoever to the PKK .
" The Greek government with regret notes that Ankara , rather than attempting rapprochement , has chosen the path which takes it further from the civilized democratic countries of Europe , " the ministry said .
Earlier this month , 109 Greek parliamentarians signed an invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece , but the Greek government has made it clear that it has not invited the PKK leader to visit Greece .
