NEW HAMPSHIRE TOWN REMEMBERS HOLE RIPPED IN ITS HEART
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By LOIS R. SHEA c.1998 The Boston Globe
& UR ; & LR ; COLEBROOK , N.H .
_ Last Aug. 19 , a hole was ripped in this town 's heart .
Carl Drega , his soul full of rage and arms full of semi-automatic weapons , murdered four people .
& UR ;
& LR ; Drega killed New Hampshire state troopers Les Lord and Scott Phillips first , as they sought to question him about the dilapidated state of his pickup and threats he 'd made against District Judge Vickie Bunnell .
& UR ; & LR ; Then Drega drove to Bunnell 's office .
He killed her as she ran .
When newspaper editor Dennis Joos tried to wrestle the gun away , Drega turned it on him .
In New Hampshire , Colebrook is the tragedy by which people measure time .
There is Before Colebrook , when such things were inconceivable .
And then there is now .
`` It is New Hampshire 's tragedy of the decade , '' says New Hampshire Attorney General Philip McLaughlin , `` maybe tragedy of the century . ''
Chuck West , a New Hampshire state trooper who was involved in the shootout in which Drega was killed , says the murders `` rocked us right to the foundation . ''
Colebrook is somehow more Alaska than New England _ its downtown more Western frontier than Eastern pastoral .
To locals , points south are simply `` down below . ''
Colebrook is in the northern mountains , where everything seems to happen just a little closer to the sky ; far enough north that French accents lilt Acadian .
Keys sit in car ignitions on Main Street .
Keys to kitchen doors are lost and never missed .
People wave .
None of that has changed .
`` There was a real setting of the jaw here , almost before the shots had died away , that this monster and this horror were not going to change this place , '' says John Harrigan , publisher of the weekly News & AMP ; Sentinel , where Joos worked and where Bunnell had her office .
`` That we were too good for that , to let that bastard win . ''
Colebrook 's sense of community has only intensified since last August 19 .
`` All the time now , you see people approaching other people and saying , ` You doing OK ?
How are things going ? '' ' Harrigan says .
`` That 's not the idle sort of ` Howya doin ' ? ' And if you tell them you 're not doing OK , well , they 'll haul you off somewhere for supper or out for a beer or out for a drive . ''
Many people here are tired of rehashing the event , weary of the tears that flow with each new memorial .
The families of the victims are not interested in talking to reporters .
`` I think most of the town feels it 's time to put this to rest , '' says Sylvia Collins , who manages the state liquor store here .
`` We 're never going to forget it , but it 's time to try to heal it . ''
But August 19 is a constant undercurrent .
Angry public outbursts are no longer shrugged off .
The manager of the IGA store where Lord and Phillips were shot notices now `` if somebody odd-looking comes in . ''
New Hampshire has considered expanding its death penalty law ; a gun control measure introduced in the state Legislature this session failed .
New Hampshire 's stalking law has been strengthened , and Vermont has enacted a criminal threatening law .
New Hampshire police are poring over a recently released 2,600-page report of the killings to see if procedural changes are needed .
Communication among law enforcement agencies is being improved .
When the news hits that a boy with a gun killed four people in Oregon , the intake of breath in Colebrook is sharper than in most places .
These people know exactly how that feels .
Exactly .
`` We 'll have good days , and then there 's days you just don n't want to get out of bed , '' says Colebrook Police Chief Mike Sielicki .
`` I think that 's everybody in town . ''
Audrey Noyes is 65 .
Her family has been in Colebrook since `` eighteen-six . ''
This town , she says , has lost something forever .
`` I keep comparing that Drega thing to a woman being raped , '' Noyes says , sadly .
`` We lost our innocence is all . ''
Karen Lamontagne still has the dream .
The one where the spirits of the four victims wander through town , having been ripped away so suddenly that they can not find peace .
The one where Drega 's specter invades Colebrook again , restless and menacing .
Lamontagne , a nurse , was across the street from the News & AMP ; Sentinel when Joos and Bunnell were shot .
She ran to them , saw Vickie lying in so much blood that she knew she could only be dead .
She tried hard to save Dennis , felt one of the final flickers of his pulse .
Sometimes she still goes to sleep crying .
Sometimes she still wakes up crying .
John Harrigan has come to expect the crashes .
His small staff at the News & AMP ; Sentinel still has them sometimes _ days when August 19 rears its head and makes the work of newspapering impossible .
`` I think we 're doing damn well , considering , '' says Harrigan .
`` We 're not doing real well compared to what life should be .
We 're still living this nightmare . ''
Last week alone , two staffers could not make it to work .
Each day , they walk across the parking lot where Bunnell 's blood-soaked body lay for hours as police conducted their investigation and the paper 's staff soldiered on and put out the next edition .
Her body was just there , near a spot filled now with spring pollen .
Each day , they look out the newsroom window at the shiny black granite memorial .
Just there , near the place where Dennis fell .
Each day , they work in a building with a bullethole in it .
A bullethole that could , conceivably , be repaired .
`` Yeah .
Why not push over the monument and fill the puddle in and ...
no , '' says Harrigan .
`` In fact , maybe living with it day to day is a strengthening process . ''
Harrigan and Bunnell had been close for years , dated sometimes .
From the roof of Harrigan 's refurbished Cape-style home on South Hill , you can see Canada .
He points down over the hill , past the sheep 's watering trough , to where Bunnell lived .
They both loved thunderstorms .
When the sky grew dark and the lightning started to flash over Monadnock Mountain , they would call one another and bet supper on whose house the storm would hit .
The other day , a storm came in , roiling and beautiful .
Harrigan reached for the phone .
& UR ; & LR ;
For his work under unimaginable duress on the night of the massacre , Harrigan nearly won a Pulitzer Prize .
He 's glad he didn n't win .
Not for something like that .
On the afternoon of August 19 , Nila Venne stopped at the IGA .
Her 13-year-old son , Ian , stayed in the car to take a nap .
Her 9-year-old daughter , Ariel , went into the store with her .
Nila Venne heard that someone was shooting in the parking lot .
She ran to the front of the store .
In silhouette , through the white window posters , she saw Drega standing next to her car , the one with her child in it , shooting .
She was told to get to the back of the store .
Despite that instinct that all mothers think would send them running directly into gunfire , Venne knew there was nothing she could do .
& UR ; & LR ; Ian heard the gunfire , sat up , saw Drega shoot at Phillips , heard Phillips screaming for help .
The child ducked back down .
He thought he would die , too .
When Drega drove away , and the doors of the IGA slid open , Ian and his mom ran to one another .
Ian 's nightmares have subsided now .
But Colebrook 's children , Venne says , learned that day that people _ even big , important , strong people like police officers _ can die .
Chief Sielicki says the months since the shootings have been wrought with discipline problems in the schools .
Anger management workshops have been set up for the kids .
Sielicki says he 's not sure how much of that is a direct correlation to Drega , but that they 've never had so many problems in the schools .
Life , of course , goes on .
The lilacs are in bloom , the peas are planted .
There are Little League games to be played , fences to mend .
But Colebrook is the tragedy by which people measure time .
There is Before Colebrook , and then there is now .
Healing will come , eventually , and the searing pain will fade .
`` What will not fade , '' says Harrigan , his blue eyes like storm clouds , `` is the image of Shangri-La lost . ''
