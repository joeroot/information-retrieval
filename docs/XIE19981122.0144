Foreign Plane Producers Battle for Chinese Orders
BEIJING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Boeing Co. is now involved in an aerial battle with Airbus Industrie to win orders from Chinese airlines for aircraft to serve high frequence short-to-medium range routes , said today 's China Daily .
According to the English newspaper , Boeing introduced its newest twinjet , the 106-seat 717 - 200 , to China during Airshow China ' 98 , which will close in Beijing today .
At the same time , Airbus Industrie intensified promotion of its large wide-body A340-500 / 600 series .
So far this year , Boeing has delivered 40 aircraft to Chinese airlines , while Airbus has delivered 19 .
In terms of sales value , Boeing is still doing nearly three times better than Airbus , said the paper .
" Fuelled by demands from growth in tourism , trade , and visits between Chinese relatives , China 's air transport market will continue to experience sustained growth between now and 2017 , " Rolf Rue , president of Airbus Industrie China Operations , was quoted as saying .
During the period , he predicted , Chinese airlines will need to purchase 1,381 airliners with 70 or more seats , worth some 130 billion US dollars .
Most Chinese airlines have incurred losses recently due to a sharp decline in traffic and profits caused by the economic turmoil and a slowdown in domestic economic growth , said the China Daily .
But it quoted analysts as saying that the downturn was temporary , as China 's aviation sector can still expect rapid expansion of passenger and cargo demand .
Bai Zhijian , president of the China Aviation Supplies Import & AMP ; Export Corp. , China 's only authorized civil aircraft importer , told the newspaper : " The government is not saying it is suspending approval for purchases of aircraft ; the policy is to decelerate the pace of fleet expansion for the time being because of the Asian crisis .
