McGWIRE FAST BECOMING A BASEBALL IMMORTAL ( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By MARK SOMMER c.1998 Albany Times Union
ALBANY , N.Y .
_ When it comes to baseball lore , Babe Ruth 's presence has loomed so large that he might just as well be one of the gods on Mount Olympus .
That has made the accomplishments of Mark McGwire in recent years all the more astonishing .
It can now be argued the veteran player has been hitting home runs farther , and more frequently , than anyone who has come before him , the Babe included .
Indeed , it sounds like heresy to say it , but the St. Louis Cardinals slugger may actually be hitting more home runs of Ruthian proportions that the almighty Ruth himself .
In a culture where casually tossed around terms like `` superstar '' and even `` star '' have lost much of their meeting , both in sports and entertainment , McGwire is metamorphosing before our eyes into a living , breathing baseball immortal .
For a public constantly retrofitting the present with a wistful glance back to the past , he 's the real thing in present time .
Take McGwire 's latest home-run tear : From May 12 to May 24 , he launched seven home runs that rocketed out of ballparks at distances estimated between 440 and 545 feet , with five traveling more than 470 feet .
Those statistics are simply staggering .
No stranger to tape-measure home runs , McGwire last year deposited a pitch delivered by fireballer Randy Johnson some 538 feet from home plate , and tagged another months later that went 517 feet .
He crushed six other balls during the season that traveled at least 445 feet .
McGwire has homered over Busch Stadium 's left-field scoreboard , reached the fifth deck in Toronto 's Skydome , blasted a ball on top of the left-field roof at Tiger Stadium and tattooed the Budweiser sign on the Jacobs Field scoreboard in Cleveland .
While McGwire seems to have entered another realm in his playing , the 12-year veteran has been one of the premier home run hitters in baseball since coming into the league with the Oakland Athletics in 1987 .
That year he shattering the rookie home run record by hitting 49 .
But the baseball world began to really take notice of McGwire 's home-run-hitting prowess when he hit 52 home runs in 1996 , despite missing 32 games due to injury .
Speculation mounted that he could make a run at what is baseball 's most appealing record , Roger Maris ' all-time season mark of 61 homers set in 1961 .
McGwire came close last year with 58 , despite a weeks-long tailspin that preceded his late-season trade to the Cardinals .
This season 's pace , with two-thirds of a season still to go , has McGwire hitting over 80 home runs , which simply isn n't going to happen .
Whether he can eclipse Maris ' coveted record , which has stood the test of time 37 years , longer than Ruth 's previous record of 60 , also remains very much to be seen .
But for those who doubt whether McGwire really belongs in the same league with Ruth , consider the following :
_ Percentage .
McGwire recently edged past Ruth to have the highest percentage of home runs per at bats over the course of a career .
Whether McGwire 's frequency eventually tails off , it 's an almost certainly the two will be 1 - 2 in the record books .
_ Distance .
During much of Ruth 's playing days , he was in a class by himself when it came to hitting homers .
But it was rare when anyone actually measured how far balls went .
What we know is simply anecdotal , but stories abound of Ruth hitting king-sized home runs .
McGwire , of course , seems to hit colossal shots with a greater frequency than such prodigious modern-day home run sluggers as Mickey Mantle , Willie McCovey , Richie Allen and Cecil Fielder .
_ Ballparks .
Ruth had the advantage of playing in Yankee Stadium , with its cozy right-field porch that was a left-handed hitter 's dream .
Maris benefited from that , too .
McGwire , on the other hand , has had to play most of his career in cavernous Oakland Coliseum , until the last couple of seasons one of the tougher parks in the majors for hitting home runs .
_ Career totals .
McGwire recently passed Ruth to become the fastest player to reach 400 home runs .
That still leaves McGwire around 300 home runs behind the Sultan of Swat , and it 's doubtful he can reach him , given his age ( 34 ) and that he is injury-prone , which accounted for missing more than 300 games alone between 1993 and 1995 .
Still , the frequency and distance of McGwire 's home runs have earned him the right to be put in the illustrious company of the mythical Babe Ruth .
The two also share something that 'll never show up in the record books : their love of children .
The Babe 's affection for kids is legendary .
Last year , a teary-eyed McGwire announced he was setting up a special foundation to aid abused children .
`` When people put my name next to Ruth 's name , '' McGwire recently said , `` it still blows me away .
I 'm still in awe . ''
So are we .
But it can now be said .
Babe Ruth .
Mark McGwire .
