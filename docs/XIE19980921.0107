Hong Kong Inflation Dives to Record Low
HONG KONG , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Consumer price inflation in Hong Kong fell to a 17-year low of 2.7 percent in August , the latest government statistics show .
The August Composite Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) increased 2.7 percent on a year-on-year base , lower than that of 3.2 percent in July , the Census and Statistics Department said Monday .
It is the lowest inflation rate ever recorded since October of 1981 , when the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI was first computed .
A substantial decrease in food prices was responsible for the low inflation rate in August , when prices of food declined by 3.5 percent against a high base of comparison a year earlier .
Private housing rentals and prices of miscellaneous goods continued to ease during the month .
A government spokesman said Monday that the continued moderation in consumer price inflation to a record low of 2.7 percent in August was a reflection of the adjustment process that has been going on expeditiously in the economy against the impact of the Asian financial turmoil .
