Indian Military Exercises Being Monitoring Closely :
ISLAMABAD , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Pakistan is closely monitoring the current military exercises being conducted by India which are the largest since 1987 , a spokesman for the Foreign Office said Thursday .
Pakistan can not remain oblivious to the fact that these exercises , which involve the Indian army as well as the airforce , navy , marine corps and coastguards , are being conducted in the vicinity of its territory , the spokesman said .
What is more alarming , he said , is that the exercises involve amphibious assault operations described as a " seabourne attack " on a " hostile " shore .
" Such operations can only be perceived as aggressive maneuvers and raise questions about their intent and purpose , " the spokesman said .
" They , therefore , cause justifiable concern among India 's neighbors , " he added .
It is regrettable , the spokesman said that " this provocative demonstration of force is taking place soon after tensions in the region have been exacerbated by Indian nuclearization of South Asia and continuing stalemate in talks with Pakistan as a result of New Delhi 's intransigent attitude . "
