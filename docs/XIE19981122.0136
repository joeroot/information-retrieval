More Firms Set To List in Hong Kong
BEIJING , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- A fresh group of mainland companies is poised to go public in Hong Kong as the market show signs of stabilizing , reported China Daily today .
The China Securities Regulatory Commission last week said it had completed the selection of the fifth batch of firms for overseas listing , and Hong Kong is the prime choice for such firms .
The Hong Kong market has returned to around 10,000 points from its low of about 6,000 last year , buoyed by a reviving Japanese currency and a belief that regional economies have reached the bottom , and are set to recover .
And many international investors are coming back to the Hong Kong market from the United States as the prospects of the US economy remain unclear .
The full list of H-share candidates has not been publicized , but market sources said the majority of the enterprises are from industries in the infrastructure sector such as airport and highway construction and power generation .
Infrastructure companies are believed to have stable and lucrative yields .
Moreover , these firms are usually new and free from the burdens of social obligations which hamper the operations of the many State firms .
However , some analysts said the " China fever " seen in the first half of last year will not recur because investors have become more realistic in the wake of the financial crisis .
Investors will be cautious as there are still many uncertainties as to what measures China will take to sustain its high economic growth next year , analysts said , adding investors will check the quality of the listed companies carefully rather than just snapping up any old China-related shares , as they tended to do early last year .
