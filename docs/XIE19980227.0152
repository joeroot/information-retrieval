Pak Unhappy with U.S. Opinion on Anti-drug Efforts
ISLAMABAD , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Pakistan Friday expressed disappointment over the United States failure to appreciate its extensive and far-reaching measures to curb drug-trafficking .
" The government ( of Pakistan ) is fully satisfied at the counter narcotics efforts made by our agencies , " Foreign Office spokesman said in responding to the U.S. criticism of its anti-narcotics efforts .
The U.S. government Thursday criticized Pakistan for its poor record in the war on drugs during 1997 but granted it a sanctions waiver for national security reasons .
The spokesman said during 1997 Pakistan intensified its anti-drug efforts and passed a comprehensive legislation in the form of Control of Narcotics Substances Act 1997 .
Meanwhile , Pakistan continued to actively cooperate with a number of international organizations and countries in the region and beyond , including the U.S. , to eliminate the scourge of drugs , he said .
He said these efforts yielded concrete results in the form of increased number of seizures , arrests , curbs on cultivation and indictment of drug traffickers .
The steps taken by the Pakistani government have been appreciated by some international agencies , he added .
However , the U.S. opinion will not affect Pakistan 's determination to continue combating drug-trafficking as the country itself is a victim of drug smuggling , transit and addiction , the spokesman said .
While promising that Pakistan will comply with its commitment to eliminating the menace of drugs , he warned that reduction in international assistance would inevitably impair his country 's efforts in this field .
The spokesman also drew attention to the growing demand for illicit drugs in the West .
Unless these countries took strong measures to ensure demand reduction , the fight against narcotics would remain elusive , he stressed .
