Corporate Chiefs in India See Mid-Term Poll
NEW DELHI , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- The electoral setback suffered by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) in the assembly elections has led to exasperation in the corporate sector , with industry captains calling the situation " fluid " , The Business Standard said here Monday .
" Mid-term polls are inevitable in 1999 .
The only questions left to be answered are whether they will be held before the summer or after the summer and who will lead us to it : a BJP government or a Congress government .
Neither the BJP government nor a Congress government - if it is formed - can complete the full five-year term of the Lower House of Parliament , " the paper quoted Bajaj Auto chairman Rahul Bajaj as saying .
A mid-term poll next year would have adverse impacts on the economy as it would mean more populist policies besides the high expenditure on conducting elections , he said .
However , there were two positive fallouts of the political developments : first , that only the BJP and the Congress are serious contenders to form the government at the Center , and secondly , the Congress leaders have become aware that there is an alternative to the party , he further said .
Another corporate chief executive ( Eicher Group ) Subodh Bhargava said that the assembly election results were a " qualitative assessment " of the BJP rule by the voters .
" The Madhya Pradesh election results , in particular , have proved that the voting pattern was not just blind anti-incumbency . "
Asian Paints vice-chairman Ashwin Choksi said that a mid-term poll could not be ruled out .
" One should not be surprised ( if it happens ) . "
Sanmar Group chairman N. Kumar said that " more fluid " was the right expression to describe the current political situation .
" It was always fluid , " he said .
