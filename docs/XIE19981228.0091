Tanzania Expects 15,000 Tourists in 1999 from Far
DAR ES SALAAM , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Tanzania expects to receive 15,000 tourists from the Far East region next year , doubling the number of tourists from that area last year , newspapers here reported Monday .
Zakia Meghji , the Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism , told the media Sunday that the expected influx of tourists from Japan , South Korea and Malaysia will increase from last year 's 7,500 to more than 15,000 next year .
She said this move followed a massive promotional campaign jointly undertaken by her ministry and the Tanzania Tourist Board ( TTB ) during President Benjamin Mkapa 's mid December visit in the Far East .
The promotional exercise , she said , involved the holding of tourism seminars by Tanzanian tour operators , investors and their counterparts from the three countries .
Meghji , who accompanied Mkapa in the tour , said inquiries in the seminars indicated that the number of tourists from those countries would double .
" Our promotional exercise revealed that a lot of people in the Far East do not know about Tanzania as far as tourism is concerned .
Many of them think that Mountain Kilimanjaro is in Kenya , " she said .
Many tourism operators are very interested in investing in building luxury hotels in Dar es Salaam , Arusha and Zanzibar , she added .
They also expressed interest to establish direct air links with Tanzania in order to promote tourism and trade through joint ventures and aircraft leasing .
" Tanzania should be aggressive in marketing its tourism potentials in order to make it a world tourist destination , earning the country much needed foreign currency , " she said .
Though with the famous game parks including Serengeti , Ngorongoro Crater and the highest mountain of Kilimanjaro in the African continent , Tanzania attracted only a total of 392,000 tourists last year due to its insufficient tourism infrastructure .
