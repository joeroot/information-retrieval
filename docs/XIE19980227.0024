Zimbabweans to Discuss Land Issue in London
HARARE , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Zimbabwean farmers , academics and representatives from the government will next month meet in London to discuss the way forward on the land reform program , the commercial farmers union said Thursday .
Deputy Director of the Union Jerry Grant told the Zimbabwean News Agency that they were determined to go forward with their government colleagues on a similar basis and present a united opinion on the land issue .
" The last thing we need to do on an international conference like this is to show divergency of opinion , " Grant said .
" We are going there as one , and if we don n't do this we would do ourselves a lot of harm , " he said .
Grant said the farmers felt they had gone a long way in trying to meet the government 's requirements on the reforms , and that they had developed a program that they could discuss .
" We believe the government officials have accepted this as a forward , although we have no clear mandate as yet , " he said , adding the union hoped this would be rationalized before the London conference on March 11 .
Last month farmers offered 1.5 million hectares of commercial farm land that would be used for the settling of landless peasants under the poverty alleviation program .
But the government announced to compulsorily acquire more than five million hectares of land from white farmers for the resettlement .
