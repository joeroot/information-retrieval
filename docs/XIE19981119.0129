Cigarettes Kill 2,000 Chinese Every Day
BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Cigarettes now claim the lives of 2,000 people in China every day , according to a recent study .
That is expected to climb to 8,000 per day , or 3 million every year , by the middle of the next century if current smoking patterns persist .
This is a new warning of the hazards of tobacco in China , the world 's biggest tobacco producer and home of 320 million smokers .
Chinese researchers have worked with Oxford University and Cornell University on two national studies of tobacco-related deaths , involving 1.25 million people .
About 1 out of 8 male deaths is caused by smoking .
By 2050 it will be 1 in 3.
Of over 300 million males aged 29 or less , at least 100 million will eventually be killed by tobacco and half these deaths will be between the ages of 35 and 69 , says Professor Niu Shiru of China 's Academy of Preventive Medicine .
Prof. Liu Boqi of China 's Academy of Medical Sciences and his group found that about 45 percent of China 's smoking-related deaths are caused by chronic lung disease , 15 percent by lung cancer and 5 to 8 percent from esophagus cancer , stomach cancer , liver cancer , strokes , heart disease , and tuberculosis .
The researchers studied one million people who had died in 24 big cities and 74 rural counties for smoking patterns , and found that , unfortunately , most people seriously underestimate the risks , according to Prof. Yang Gonghuan of CAPM , who says that a 1996 national study showed that two-thirds said they believed smoking did little or no harm .
Nearly 60 percent did not know it can cause lung cancer and 96 percent did not know it can cause heart disease , she says .
Daily cigarette use among Chinese males has risen to 15 from only 1 in 1952 .
On average , two-thirds of males become smokers at the age of 25 and smoking becomes a lifetime habit .
