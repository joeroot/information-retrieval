( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) ( Undated ) : capture it , ``
Paramount Pictures began early press and sneak screenings of `` The Truman Show '' months ago , hoping to get out the word that this was not another slapstick Carrey movie along the lines of `` Ace Ventura : Pet Detective '' or `` Dumb and Dumber . ''
The studio was successful at building considerable audience awareness and positive word-of-mouth .
Esquire ran an advance story calling The Truman Show `` the movie of the decade . ''
Paramount was also testing the waters to find out how to market its unusual film , mindful of the relative disaster that occurred when Carrey first tried a satire , the dark `` The Cable Guy . ''
That 1996 movie finally managed to make $ 100 million worldwide , far less than anticipated .
Carrey 's fans _ those who loved him in slapstick films _ were not pleased with his portrayal of a character in whom the comedy was scary and strange .
`` It 's just a shooting gallery sometimes , '' Carrey says .
`` It 's just your time to go in front of the guys with the guns .
It was politics , a lot of things .
And then there was the money that had never been heard of before . ''
( Carrey got an unprecedented $ 20 million to star in `` The Cable Guy . '' )
He knew early in his career that he had to branch out from the narrow comedy rut he was digging for himself .
`` The very same people who go , ` I just want to see him do this one thing , ' if you did that one thing five times in a row , they 're over you , '' Carrey says .
`` I 'm not comparing myself to The Beatles , but it happened to them .
( Some fans ) rejected every change .
` Why did you cut your hair ?
Why are you with this person ( Yoko Ono ) ? '' '
Since `` The Cable Guy , '' Carrey has apparently expanded his fan base with `` Liar Liar , '' which appealed to a more mature audience than `` Ace Ventura . ''
But that 's no guarantee `` The Truman Show '' will succeed .
`` The concern of the studio is not so much his fans , '' Weir says .
`` We 're more concerned with people who don n't like Jim Carrey .
`` They ( Paramount ) have done enough testing to know there 's a drop-off of those who are maybe too young ( to appreciate `` The Truman Show '' ) or just want to see him slip on a banana skin , '' Weir says .
It 's rare for a director to admit before a movie opens that there may be some people who won n't like it .
Carrey does see a cautious side to himself when it comes to choosing his movies .
`` I want to to read carefully , '' he says .
`` I don n't want to do everything .
I 'm not the type of person who has to work all the time .
I don n't really define myself by being the most busy person .
If I could have a beeper-free world , I would . ''
But he 's not easily deterred from a project in which he 's interested .
`` The Truman Show was one of the best scripts I 'd ever read , '' he says .
`` And Peter Weir 's involvement was a huge deal for me . ''
Asked if he is eager for the day when he 'll be doing straight dramatic roles , rather than just comedy , Carrey gives a verbal shrug : `` Sure .
`` I don n't know where I 'm heading .
I do them as they come .
This one was offered to me , and the situation was great .
How could I turn it down ?
`` If I get the opportunities to show other sides of myself , that 's fantastic , and I appreciate it .
But I think my comedy is just as important . ''
He 's content with the way things are going in his career .
`` How could I be anything but happy ? ''
he asks .
`` I 'm ecstatic .
It 's a dream come true that way .
To have people like Peter Weir believe in you is , like , ridiculous .
And I didn n't even have to lop my ear off . ''
