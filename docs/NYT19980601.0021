RED SOX RIDE 11-RUN INNING TO SPLIT
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By GORDON EDES c.1998 The Boston Globe
NEW YORK _ By the usual definition , scoring 11 runs in the third inning , the biggest inning against the Yankees in 55 years , and winning by six constitutes a laugher .
Then why wasn n't anyone wearing a Red Sox uniform laughing Sunday afternoon ?
Because before the end of a 13 - 7 win over the New York Yankees , slugger Mo Vaughn was mad at his teammates , pitcher Pedro Martinez was mad at plate umpire Jim Joyce and Yankee outfielder Bernie Williams , and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan was mad at the American League .
Dennis Eckersley , meanwhile , was too drained to express either mirth or anger .
The Eck was just relieved to have survived the seventh inning , when the Yankees drew to within 11 - 7 , loaded the bases , and had the tying run at the plate with no outs .
That 's right , no outs .
`` Think about them coming back from 11 - 0 , '' Eckersley said .
`` That would have been humiliating .
That would have been the ultimate .
You never forget something like that .
`` Thank God the kid made the big play .
It was huge .
Maybe that play turned my whole season around .
You never know . ''
Eckersley , who already had walked home a run and given up a ground-ball single that made it 11 - 7 , was referring to the face-saving play made by the Framingham Kid .
Second baseman Lou Merloni made a sprawling backhanded stop of pinch hitter Jorge Posada 's smash and flipped the ball while still on his stomach to shortstop Nomar Garciaparra , who threw out Posada for an inning-ending double play .
`` You don n't ever think that game should have come down to something like that , '' said the Red Sox rookie , who had a direct hand in both weekend wins over the Yankees , having singled home the deciding run in Boston 's 3 - 2 win Saturday .
Merloni 's words apparently echoed Vaughn 's thoughts , because when the Red Sox came off the field after that inning , one in which two relievers , John Wasdin and Ron Mahay , came and went without getting anybody out , Vaughn had a meltdown in the dugout .
Gesturing furiously , Vaughn paced from one end of the dugout to the other , his voice at a decibel level normally associated with aircraft engines , before knocking a cooler off the dugout steps .
`` He just snapped , I guess , '' Eckersley said .
`` I don n't really know what he was saying .
That game was about to get away from us .
I guess he was trying to wake people up . ''
The eruption of Mount Mo , a public display with little precedent in recent Red Sox annals , appeared to have the desired effect .
The Sox had managed just Darren Bragg 's infield single in the four innings following the third , which began with a broken-bat single by rookie Jason Varitek off Yankees lefthander Andy Pettitte and ended 43 minutes and 76 pitches later , after 16 batters , 9 hits , and 3 walks .
It was Boston 's biggest inning in 12 years , one in which both Garciaparra ( two-run double , RBI infield hit ) and rookie Varitek ( the broken-bat single , two-run double ) had two hits apiece , Darren Lewis walked twice , and Varitek , Lewis , and John Valentin all scored twice .
But after Vaughn 's diatribe , the Red Sox opened the eighth with three straight hits .
They didn n't score because Lewis was tossed out stealing and Vaughn and Troy O ' Leary grounded out , but they finally put the game out of reach in the top of the ninth with four more hits , including Lewis 's two-run single .
Still , it defied belief that manager Jimy Williams had to have his closer , Tom Gordon , warming up in a game in which staff ace Martinez was staked to an 11-run lead .
But Martinez was gone with the score 11 - 4 and two out in the sixth .
He was lifted because Joe Girardi hit his 130th pitch for a three-run home run , but he was livid because of Joyce 's pitch-calling and what he viewed as Bernie Williams 's stalling .
`` I thought I was going to fly through this game , '' Martinez said .
`` I was throwing strikes .
I can see the strike zone better than anybody .
But the third strike is hard to get in this league .
They 'll call strike one , strike two , but they won n't call strike three . ''
Asked if he said anything to the umpire , Martinez said : `` I would never do that .
He should know himself .
Once he sees the highlights play tonight , he can see . ''
Eckersley , who felt he was squeezed on the bases-loaded walk he issued to pinch hitter Tim Raines , smiled broadly when told that Martinez had complained about the umpiring .
`` He did ? ''
Eckersley said , eyes widening .
`` Good .
The umpire squeezed him .
And that guy ( Joyce ) has a big ( strike ) zone , supposedly . ''
Martinez wasn n't smiling when he complained that Williams , who had four hits Sunday and 10 hits in his last 12 at-bats against the Red Sox , continued to step in and out of the batter 's box against him .
`` I said to him in Spanish , ` Batea , batea ( hit , hit ) , '' ' Martinez said , talking about Williams 's at-bat in the fourth inning , when he singled .
`` The game was 11 - 0.
He knew I was going to throw the ball over the plate .
He put his hand out to me and said , ` Hold on . ' I 'm laughing at him .
He knows I 'm not going to pitch when he 's not ready . ''
Kerrigan accused the Yankee hitters of trying to play `` mind games '' with Martinez , and wondered why just a few days ago , AL president Gene Budig praised the Red Sox for the up-tempo way they play , but doesn n't tell his umpires to make hitters stay in the box .
`` It 's a very frustrating experience , that the game was three hours ( actually 3 : 45 ) , '' Martinez said .
`` I don n't think I 've ever pitched a three-hour game .
`` I have two things in mind when I pitch : Lose it quick , or win it quick . ''
This was not a game for the quick , nor the dead .
With the lava of Mount Mo still cooling , it was on to Toronto .
