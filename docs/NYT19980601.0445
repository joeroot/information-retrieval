AN EXPERIENCED PIOLINE OUTLASTS RUSSIAN QUALIFIER

PARIS _ Giddy as a man who had just won the lottery , or at the very least won his first career Grand Slam event at the doddering age of 28 , Cedric Pioline kissed his racquet , his wristband , and almost kissed Moscow 's Marat Safin , the towering neophyte he had outwitted and outlasted in a five-set test Monday .
With 15,000 fans in delirium and the 18-year-old Safin in a tailspin , Pioline completed his mission , which was to fight his way into his second quarterfinal here after a decade spent trying to distinguish himself on his native clay at Roland Garros .
Covering the court like a madman , and returning Safin 's thundering serve as if he had been programmed to decipher it , Pioline prevailed 7 - 5 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 and remained the last hope of France at this French Open .
The 3 : 18 struggle turned into a triumph of experience over raw ambition : Pioline , father of two and veteran of 31 Grand Slam events , including two finals , remained focused from beginning to end .
`` Experience got me through , and the people , '' said Pioline , who admitted his `` legs and mind '' were just about gone by the time the 6-foot-4-inch Safin shanked a backhand return on the Frenchman 's second match point .
Safin , appearing in his first Grand Slam event after making his Davis Cup debut alongside Yevgeny Kafelnikov two months ago in a losing effort in Atlanta , lost his concentration in the fourth set and couldn n't retrieve it .
`` No concentration on important points , '' said Safin , who left Russia when he was 14 to train year-round in Spain , sponsored by a Swiss bank he never bothered to learn the name of .
`` They just send the money , '' said Safin , who is now bankrolling himself .
He earned more here in a week than he did in all of 1997 , and planned to tackle Wimbledon next .
`` Never stepped on grass before , '' said Safin , who added that he planned to take an armload of racquets `` to break . ''
Safin didn n't murder his racquet Monday , but his petulance was costly against Pioline , whose tunnel vision seemed to improve in inverse proportion to the teen-ager 's loss of concentration , which yielded 72 unforced errors .
Once Pioline nailed a backhand return to the corner at break point to take a 5 - 4 lead in the fourth set , Safin was transformed from a hot young dog to a hangdog , and when he double faulted at break point to give the veteran a 2 - 1 edge in the final set , Pioline took care not to squander the gift .
`` I wasn n't tired , but when you lose the concentration , then the people , the racquets , everything is bad , '' said Safin .
He wasn n't the only Russian teen-ager to fade away Monday .
When last seen Sunday night , Anna Kournikova was swabbing daintily at the tears in her eyes on the gloomy center court .
Chief umpire Bruno Rebeuh , head of the French Open 's officiating staff , had not only denied her request to halt her fourth-round match against Jana Novotna because she couldn n't see the ball in the dark , but also out-and-out refused her plea for a bathroom break .
Too mature to throw a scene , 16-year-old Kournikova played on until allowed to quit with Novotna ahead 4 - 2 in the third set , but she resented the treatment she received .
`` You know , I couldn n't beg him in front of 20,000 people and the camera to go to the bathroom , '' she said .
But Kournikova , resilient as any teen-ager , put her problems behind her , slept `` like a baby , '' and marched back into battle Monday afternoon to try to solve the deficit against the third-seeded Novotna , a player who had beaten her in all three previous meetings .
But 14 minutes later , off went Kournikova , bounced from contention after her netted backhand on the second match point gave the 29-year-old Novotna a 6 - 7 ( 2 - 7 ) , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 victory .
`` She played great tennis , didn n't make any unforced errors , '' said Kournikova , whose go-for-broke baselining and anxious net-rushing produced 54 unforced errors .

But all was not lost .
Only a few hours after absorbing the defeat and chastising tournament officials for their boorish behavior with a few well-chosen barbs , there was Kournikova , chatting and posing in the stands with Ronaldo , Brazil 's World Cup poster boy .
They made a pleasant couple : the blonde goddess of women 's tennis , which lately seems as anxious to have its teen-age stars become celebrities as win Grand Slams , and the undisputed Brazilian god of soccer , a player last year 's French champion , Gustavo Kuerten , insisted was worthy of genuflection .
Though Kuerten was dethroned here in the second round by Safin , his female counterpart , 10th - seeded Iva Majoli of Croatia , kept her title defense intact by claiming the third set of her held-over match with Spain 's Conchita Martinez .
Majoli 's 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) , 6 - 7 ( 3 - 7 ) , 6 - 3 victory sent her into the quarterfinals against second-seeded Lindsay Davenport .
Unlike Kournikova , Majoli spent a sleepless night fretting over her unresolved match : `` I couldn n't sleep until the morning ; my body was just like so going crazy , '' said Majoli .
In contrast to the controversy that surrounded Kournikova 's match , Majoli and Martinez were unanimous in requesting a stoppage .
Neither wanted to start a third set , and why Kournikova and Novotna had been encouraged to do so was a mystery to Majoli , who also felt Rebeuh was out of line to deny the loser 's restroom request .
`` I don n't know all the details , but I think that was a stupid thing ; they should have let her go , '' said the 20-year-old Majoli , who hasn n't won a tournament since surprising Martina Hingis here in last year 's final .
In that match , Hingis received an official OK to take a strategic bathroom break in the second set .
While defending Kournikova and Hingis ' tactics as fully acceptable within the rules , Majoli did take a swipe at the court and locker room tactics of Hingis ' quarterfinal opponent , eighth-seeded Venus Williams , and her younger sister , Serena , who faltered in the fourth-round on Sunday against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario .
Sanchez Vicario may have won that match , but she left it fuming at Williams ' brash behavior .
`` They are a little bit different ; they have this attitude like ` we 're the best ' , and I 'm sure it 's going to change in a year or so when they grow up and realize they don n't have to be mean , '' said Majoli .
`` But they look at you like you 're nobody and they 're the best . ''
On the men 's side , the Spanish contingent , which arrived at the Open with a record 19 male contenders , was whittled down to three Monday .
Fourteenth-seeded Alex Corretja joined Carlos Moya and Felix Mantilla in the quarterfinals by defeating Jason Stoltenberg 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3.
But the unseeded Francisco Clavet was beaten 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 by Belgium 's Filip Dewulf , a 1997 semifinalist , and 16th - seeded Alberto Berasetegui , a runner-up to Sergi Bruguera in 1994 , was upended by Morocco 's 45th - ranked Hicham Arazi 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3.
Arazi reached the quarterfinals last year by defeating this year 's favorite , Marcelo Rios .
