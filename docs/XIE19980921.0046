Mogadishu Situation Still Volatile
Though real reason for the fighting is not known , an eyewitness in the market said the shooting began when a group of militiamen on a battle wagon arrived at the khat-selling kiosks ostensibly to buy some khat at a time when there was another group of infantry gunmen in the market probably for the same reason .
The eyewitness could not clarify who started the shooting , but described the incident as suspicion-provoked clash .
The two sides have earlier in the year clashed several times in the same area for somewhat political reasons .
The deceased include two women and a money exchange dealer , all innocent civilians , caught in the cross fire .
In another similar clash , at least two people were wounded and all of the business activities came to a total stagnation in the port town of Merca Sunday .
According to eyewitnesses , the trouble started when the guards of the market in Merca Town , 100 km south of Mogadishu , caught two men allegedly for theft practice and whipped them .
Gunmen at the police station of the town were reported to have been annoyed by the apprehension made by the guards of the market and have tried to round up the market security men to arrest .
The move by the police force then provoked the two groups to fire upon each other .
The market security men have wounded two men on the police vehicle and captured the police vehicle .
