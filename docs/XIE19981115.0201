U.S. Says Iraqi Offer on Inspection Unacceptable
WASHINGTON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States said Saturday that Iraq 's offer to allow the U.N. inspections to resume is " unacceptable " and it remained poised for military action against Iraq .
The U.S. will consult with its allies to consider next steps , said National Security Council advisor Sandy Berger at a news conference at the White House after a more than five-hour session of President Bill Clinton 's national security advisers .
" There certainly is not unlimited time " for Iraq to comply , Berger said .
It needed to give a " clear statement that they will fully comply " with U.N. weapons inspections .
Berger said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has had " plenty of opportunity to demonstrate that he 's prepared to come back in compliance " with U.N. demands that he has disposed of his weapons of mass destruction .
The U.S. remains poised to take military action against Iraq , he said .
Military action still remained an option for Clinton and it could be taken at any time .
Berger said , " We have said all along that we are ready to proceed , but we will proceed on the basis of our timetable . "
Military planners have developed a range of strike options for Clinton , Berger added .
Earlier , U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to stay home to deal with the Iraqi crisis instead of going to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) meeting even after Iraq had announced its offer .
Vice President Al Gore will attend the APEC meeting , which is to be convened in Malaysia .
Clinton , who is supposed to leave at 10 : 00 EST Saturday night " hopes " to complete the remainder of the trip which includes stops in Japan , South Korea and the U.S. territory of Guam , Lockhart said .
The U.S. reaction means that the crisis is still not over .
Pentagon sources said that actually the Pentagon has already issued the order to attack Iraq with cruise missiles .
But it was delayed after Iraq made the promise to comply .
Earlier , the Iraqi authorities announced that it will accept U.N. weapons inspections to resume without conditions and inspectors would be allowed to return immediately .
The Clinton administration made it clear that the Iraqi compliance should be unconditional and full , or face serious consequences .
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that the Iraqi promise is unconditional and met all the requirements of the U.N. Security Council resolutions .
Meanwhile , the first wave of additional U.S. warplanes left for the Gulf this morning : six B-52 heavy bombers departed Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana , at 4 : 38 a.m. EST .
The aircraft were to be followed shortly by F-15s , F-16s , and other B-1 bombers from bases across the country , Air Force spokeswoman Wendy Frable said .
