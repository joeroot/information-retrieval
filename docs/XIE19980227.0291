Researchers Make Progress in Extracting Hydrogen
LONDON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- The prospect of a cheap supply of hydrogen could be a step closer as scientists in Japan and Spain succeeded in splitting the elements from water at room temperature by the use of catalysts .
The Japanese researchers , at Tokyo Institute of Technology , using a copper oxide catalyst and visible light , successfully extracted hydrogen and oxygen from water , the New Scientist reported Thursday .
Although researchers have tried the technique before , the process did not work in visible light .
Sunlight reduces cuprous oxide to metallic copper , which halts the process .
The Japanese team managed to avoid this problem by using powdered cuprous oxide and the process is said to last for 1,900 hours .
Meanwhile , a Spanish team , at the Institute of Material Science in Valencia , claimed similar results using a catalyst made of a new molybdenum compound whose details are being kept secret while a patent is applied for ,
Hydrogen is well-suited to motor vehicles .
Earlier work has shown that hydrogen can be used to run car engines with relatively little modification .
Virtually pollution-free , hydrogen is widely touted as the fuel of the future as water is an abundant source of the element .
However , the making of hydrogen gas from water by conventional electrolysis is quite expensive .
