Uganda Gains Much Economically : Museveni
KAMPALA , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- President Yoweri Museveni said here Sunday that Uganda has achieved much economically since the National Resistance Movement took power in 1986 .
He made the remarks Sunday evening when answering questions from listeners around the world via the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) .
Now Ugandans enjoy good supplies of goods and services and they are not short of living necessities like sugar , salt , transport and housing as they used to be , he said .
With the launch of Universal Primary Education program in recent years , four children in each Ugandan family can receive free primary education and thus the education level has been enhanced among ordinary citizens .
AIDS , which used to be the key hindrance to the economic development , becomes preventable with sensitization by the government .
The infection rate has dropped from 30 to 15 percent , he noted .
Meanwhile , Museveni acknowledged that Uganda is still one of the poorest countries in the world .
