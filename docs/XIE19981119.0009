Clinton Starts Trip to Japan , South Korea
WASHINGTON , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton left here on Wednesday to start his visit to Japan and South Korea with economic and security issues high on the agenda .
" Nothing is more important to restore growth in Asia than efforts to restart Japan 's economy , " Clinton told reporters gathered on the South Lawn of the White House .
He said he is looking forward to discussions with Japan 's leaders on how to promptly and effectively stimulate demand and economic growth and open Japan 's markets to fair trade .
Clinton said the United States has met its own obligations to halt the global economic crisis , assisting the International Monetary Fund , helping organize an assistance package for Brazil to prevent the crisis from spreading and pressing the World Bank to double its investment to help " people who have suffered the most . "
" Now we 're taking our efforts directly to Asia , where the crisis began , " Clinton said .
The president said that while in South Korea he will hold high-level discussions on " the difficult but necessary task of reforming their financial institutions , their corporate sector and getting growth on track there . "
Clinton said Korea 's corporate conglomerates must also " do their share " to foster economic reform .
His journey will take him from ornate palaces in Tokyo to military training fields in South Korea .
The final stop will be the Pacific island of Guam , where he will spend several hours before returning to Washington .
The trip was delayed and then rearranged after the weekend showdown with Iraq .
Clinton also canceled his participation of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) meeting in Malaysia .
