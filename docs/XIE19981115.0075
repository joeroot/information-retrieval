Indonesian President to Give Explanation on Shooting
JAKARTA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has pledged to the National Commission on Human Rights ( Komnas HAM ) to give explanation about the riots that have occurred recently after collecting inputs from various sides .
" The government will seek inputs , both from the security forces and the people , " State Secretary Akbar Tanjung told reporters after accompanying Habibie in receiving Komnas HAM members here Sunday .
During the meeting , the commission urged the government to make an immediate explanation to the public regarding the November 13 incident in which 11 people had been killed .
" The government has yet to decide whether or not it will form a fact finding team to investigate the incident , " Tanjung said .
He declined to comment whether or not the government would set a deadline for the team to work because usually the government would first collect as many inputs as possible from various sources .
The government gave wide opportunities to the people to send inputs including through mass media both print or electronic , he added .
Commenting on the commission 's demand for a follow-up of the outcomes of the just-ended People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) special session on the probe into former president Soeharto 's alleged wealth , Tanjung disclosed that the Attorney General Office had already inquired some 70 banks in the country .
" The Attorney General ( Andi Mohammad Ghalib ) has received an official report saying that former president Soeharto has 21 billion rupiah ( 2.6 million U.S. dollars ) , not trillions as reported by the media in his accounts , " he said .
