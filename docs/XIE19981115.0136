Getting world Back on Economic Feet Difficult : Mahathir
KUALA LUMPUR , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Sunday that with the financial crisis taking on global proportions , getting the world back on its economic feet is going to be extremely difficult .
The Malaysian leader was of the view that it would take a long time for the world economy to be back on its feet .
With unscrupulous speculators causing untold damage particularly to developing economies , currency traders freely condemned governments for not being transparent while they themselves were not , he said when opening the APEC Business Summit here Sunday .
" We should always be on the lookout for adverse consequences and be prepared to take corrective actions or even to reverse certain globalization trends , " he said .
Mahathir lamented over the present lack of a financial architecture as manifested by the anarchical and regulated capital flows in the international monetary system .
He said that owing to the currency crisis , the once prosperous East Asian region which was a huge market for European and American products has lost much of its purchasing capacity .
Mahathir cautioned against rushing towards globalization for it can be abused in such a way that instead of worldwide prosperity , there will be world poverty and disparities between rich and poor , international and civil disorders and all kinds of crisis .
" Globalization can bring about a better world if we are not fanatical about it .
Not everything that is done in the name of globalization will give good results , " he said .
Mahathir also slammed calls by some quarters that finance and trade should be left to market forces , saying it was contradictory to what was really happening because true free marketeers were being penalized .
