& HT ; COLUMN : Gore 's all-important Internet can n't replace a good teacher & HT ; By Elizabeth Schuett & HT ; c.
1998 Cox News Service
GIBSONBURG , Ohio _ Schoolteaching is not necessarily a conduit to the world of metaphysics , but my colleagues and I have had a revelation .
Vice President Gore is full of baloney .
Hooking kids up to the Internet is not the universal remedy for what ails education .
Mr. Gore is , of course , sincere in his belief that high-tech communications and information systems are going to `` fix what 's broke '' in our schools .
Sincere , but misguided .
Pudgy little hands manipulating mice ( mouses ?
meeses ? ) are impressive , but not indicative that the brain attached to the hand is learning anything more than how to surf for cartoons or vaporize space marauders .
When I was five , my father spread out a schematic on the dining room table and taught me how a Pullman car 's cooling system worked .
I caught on quickly _ that 's what kids do best _ sponge up data bits .
In short order , I was a parlor trick for dinner guests , tracing and naming all of the components and their functions .
But that was all I could do .
I couldn n't explain ( ITAL ) why ( END ITAL ) the system worked any more than I could have come up with an improved design for a new one , because I had no basic knowledge .
In other words , I was uneducated .
In a recent article in Time , Mr. Gore wrote : `` Children in technology-rich learning environments ...
developed better writing skills .
...
Already , America is sharply divided between those with access to computers and the Internet and those without it . ''
He 's right about the last part , of course .
Kids without access to the Internet can n't pull up porn pics and run copies of naked ladies in living color to share with 50 of their closest friends .
Nor can they hook up with `` chat rooms '' that thrive on the semi-literate blatherings of a bunch of bug-eyed folks who exist only when they 're online .
But as for writing better ?
I don n't think so , Mr. Veep .
Your statistics don n't match our experience .
My colleagues and I have found that computers do not create serious writers , they only enable them .
Students who are still in the mastery phase of their writing skills do a much better job when the words flow from brain to hand to paper than they do when they 're tapping out their essays on a keyboard .
We 're not sure why .
Maybe it 's because writing by hand gives the learner more time to concentrate on content , more time to think as he works .
Most appear to value their handwritten work much more than they do computer-generated copy .
Maybe because they see their writings as a more direct extension of themselves .
For a few , it 's a mistrust of the machine and a pervasive concern with the vagaries of a contraption that has once too often jumped up and
bitten them .
But we believe the biggest mistake comes in the way children are introduced to computers _ with games .
It 's a tough mind-set to break .
And what about concentration ?
Focus is tough enough to develop in kids without the added distraction of glitzy screens that flash by on command .
An already ( naturally ) limited attention span shrinks with every click of the mouse .
Serious writers begin with fat pencils , wide-lined paper , and a teacher who encourages , cajoles , illuminates , and occasionally yells at a budding Hemingway to `` shut up and write . ''
Yep , I do that , and I 've yet to run into a kid without the humor to handle it .
They tell me they like
the attention .
After a combined half-century of experience , my colleagues in the classroom and I are constantly reminded that we 're dealing with people _ unique creations , who need face-to-face communication and human feedback ( loads of it ) , and machines , no matter how ' up-market ' or high-tech , or well-connected , can not get the job done .
So , Mr. Gore , forget the phone tax and let 's get computers into perspective .
They 're tools _ not teachers .
