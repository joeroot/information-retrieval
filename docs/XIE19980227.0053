Chirac Calls for Breaking of Isolation of Iraq , Iran
PARIS , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday that the international community should break the isolation being lived by Iraq and Iran , on the condition that the two countries respect international laws .
" We should go out of the ` double containment ' of Iraq and Iran and I hope that each acts in order to let the conditions for their double re-integration appear , " said Chirac in an interview with the daily Le Monde .
Chirac said that Iraq is " very important country at the frontier of the Arab world and the Persian world , and at the epicenter of world energy ( resource ) , " he said .
" Iraq has an important role to play in the regional balance , a role that it is not in a position to play .
Therefore , we should find the way to reintegrate Iraq in the international community ...
In some way , it is the same for Iran , " he said .
Chirac said that Iraq should play the game in a " clear and uncontestable way , " which is the only way for the lifting of embargo on it and letting it return to the international community .
