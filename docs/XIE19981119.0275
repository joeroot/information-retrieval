More Beijing College Students Want to Study Aboard
BEIJING , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- More than 70 percent of Beijing college students want to study aboard , according to a survey of more than 300 students at five renowned universities in the Chinese capital .
Among the students wanting to study aboard , three-fourths named the United States as their first choice .
Some 135,000 Chinese students went to the United States to study between 1978 and 1996 .
Japan , Canada , and Britain are also favorite choices , but they each account for less than ten percent of first choices .
About one-third of the students graduating from the physics department of Beijing University have gone to study aboard , said Professor Gan Zizhao , adding that in the United States alone , the department has 500 alumnae and alumni .
Foreign universities are also focusing on Chinese students graduating from the best universities .
All 35 students from a computer department class at Beijing 's Qinghua University received scholarships from well-known foreign universities .
Better educational conditions and broader development prospects are the main attractions for students who want to study aboard , according to the survey , sponsored by the Beijing Shijilantu Market Research Co. Ltd.
The Chinese students studying aboard movement has gone through three stages .
It began at the end of the Qing Dynasty ( 1644 - 1911 ) , when a number of Chinese students were sent abroad to study Western industrial technologies ; the second stage lasted from the 1930s until the founding of the People 's Republic of China ; and China is now seeing the third wave , which began after the reform and opening drive since 1978 and continues to this day .
