METS GAINING ON YANKS
( ja ) By MURRAY CHASS c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ It won n't be long before the inter-league series between the Mets and the Yankees will be billed as a World Series preview .
Who knows ?
By that weekend , June 26 - 28 , the Mets may even be in first place .
`` Don n't count them out ; that 's the way I look at it , '' the Yankees ' Darryl Strawberry said Monday , discussing the Mets ' rapid rise in the National League East .
`` They 're sitting right at the table .
Being five out in June , there 's a great opportunity for the window to open up for them to sneak past .
You never know . ''
Having slashed Atlanta 's lead from nine games to five in the first seven games after The Trade , the Mets have not only raised their position in the NL wild-card race , but also have some dreamers thinking they could be good enough to overtake the perennial champion Braves .
It has indeed been a remarkable 10 days for the other team in town .
`` I think it 's great , '' said the Yankees ' David Cone , like Strawberry a refugee from that other team .
`` It 's the first real chance we 've had in a long time that both teams have playoff hopes .
Both teams have a legitimate chance of getting to the playoffs . ''
Strawberry considered the possibility and pronounced it exciting .
`` It would be a treat for the whole town of New York , '' he said .
`` It would be the toast of New York City for 1998 , no doubt about it . ''
Mike Piazza has made all of this possible .
Until May 22 , the Mets were a sound though boring team , a team that could win with pitching and defense but whose pitchers couldn n't afford to give up more than a run or two because they couldn n't count on the hitters to produce more .
But the acquisition of Piazza transformed the Mets into a hitting machine that amassed 54 runs and 100 hits in seven games before Monday night 's 4 - 3 loss in Pittsburgh to the league 's most effective starter , Jason Schmidt .
The accompanying winning streak catapulted the Mets into the Braves ' rearview mirror .
The developments in Queens have made the team in the Bronx take notice , although news of those developments doesn n't appear to have reached City Hall and the Yankees ' self-proclaimed No. 1 fan .
( What will the mayor do if the Mets and the Yankees meet in the World Series ?
He would actually have to see the Mets play . )
Every single member of the Yankees who was asked about those developments applauded them .
`` I thought it was a great move , '' General Manager Brian Cashman said of the Piazza trade .
`` It gives them the offense they need ; it gives them credibility with the fans .
They stepped up to the plate and addressed a need in a big way .
I think it 's good for the baseball situation in New York overall . ''
The Mets will obviously not maintain the level of play that has caught the attention of the Yankees and demanded the attention of the fans and the news media , which had buried the Mets under their blanket coverage of the Yankees ' torrid start .
But the Mets are a legitimate contender .
Whether it is for first place or the wild card , that remains to be seen .
The Mets haven n't even played the Atlanta Braves .
They won n't until the last series before the All-Star Game break .
Until then , they play teams like Pittsburgh , Tampa Bay , Montreal and Florida , and they could inflate their won-lost record in those series .
With Piazza on the scene , that would not surprise the Yankees , who are accustomed to having front-line players join them in the middle of a race .
`` Some teams in the thick of things don n't ever add or do anything , '' the Yankees ' Paul O ' Neill said .
`` Sometimes you need a boost .
Adding a player like that obviously is going to give a team a boost .
It creates a feeling that the players and management are on the same line as far as wanting to win .
It makes everything run a little bit smoother .
You don n't have management against players and you feel like you 're trying to win . ''
Strawberry said the addition of a player like Piazza builds confidence throughout the clubhouse .
`` It 's going to make the other players push a little bit more , '' he said .
`` It builds more character in the other players .
When you have a guy like that come in , it makes other players raise their ability to play the game because they know this guy comes to play .
It just brings a whole different feeling to know that you can win . ''

Cone himself has been Piazza twice in his career .
He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays and to the Yankees during division races .
`` It takes pressure off the other guys , '' the pitcher said of such an addition .
`` His presence in the lineup helps them offensively , all the other hitters and in the clubhouse .
The media attention is on him .
It 's off Butch Huskey .
It 's off Dave Mlicki .
It 's off all of them .
It allows them to relax .
It 's tough to quantify that sort of an effect , but no doubt it 's very real . ''
Cone recalled the atmosphere in the Blue Jays ' clubhouse after his arrival in August 1992 .
`` They felt this is going to get us over the hump , '' he said .
`` The rest of the pitching staff sort of felt like if they don n't win today , we 'll win tomorrow .
They didn n't have to be the stopper .
We could all contribute .
It sounds like baseball jargon a little bit , but it 's really true .
His presence no doubt has given them all an emotional lift , while at the same time taking some pressure off of them . ''
