Thailand to Cash in 139 m Dollars from Asian Games
BANGKOK , November 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Thailand is expected to cash in some 5 billion bahts ( 139 million US dollars ) from the upcoming 13th Asian Games , the Thai tourism authorities estimated on Sunday .
The income can be traced to tourists , the opening and closing ceremonies and the tickets for the competitive sports as some 100,000 visitors are expected to tour around Thailand during the 15-day regional sports gala .
Sports fans from China , Japan and South Korea have booked some 10,000 tickets for their cheering squads , mostly soccer fans , said the officials in charge of Asian Games tickets .
However , the sale of tickets is far behind the expectation and the organizers have resorted to cheaper prices to allure more local fans to the sports venues .
