ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ I don n't usually hand out bold advice I wouldn n't take myself .
Still , I was glad to hear the Manhattan Theater Club of New York City , which has a reputation for presenting new plays and talent , has decided to go ahead with a touchy play after getting threats from Catholic extremists .

GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Throughout Western Europe , roughly a million vending machines dispense Coca-Colas .
That 's a pretty tame business ; people drop in their coins and Cokes come out .
What could go wrong ?
Maybe everything .
And soon .

_ We use `` summer '' as a modifier because it conjures brighter , happier , more irresponsible images than any other season .
It should be used more widely if we are going to give summer its due .

SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG , Ohio _ Schoolteaching is not necessarily a conduit to the world of metaphysics , but my colleagues and I have had a revelation .
Vice President Gore is full of baloney .
Hooking kids up to the Internet is not the universal remedy for what ails education .

( Schuett , Cox News Service ) ( k )
EZZARD-COLUMN _ Sooner or later , Madeleine Albright was bound to have a public brush with chauvinism .
Surely there was a touch of it in the comments of House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga . ) when he declared for the benefit of the world _ and especially Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu _ that Albright was nothing more than an `` agent of the Palestinians . ''
Can anyone imagine Gingrich saying that about Henry Kissinger , George Shultz , James Baker III , Warren Christopher ?
( Ezzard , Atlanta - Journal Constitution )
