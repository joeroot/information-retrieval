Whatever its duration and outcome , the Asian financial crisis will be remembered for destroying the conventional wisdom that East Asia 's economies would prosper indefinitely .
Still in question are the political lessons that Asians will draw from the crisis .
How much , for example , will political freedom be valued as a necessary corollary to sound economic performance ?
Or will those who argue that sound economic management is the political key prove persuasive ?
And will a `` Confucian '' version of the discredited `` Asian values '' thesis find adherents ?
The crisis began on July 2 , 1997 , when the Thai government ceased wasting foreign reserves on a defense of the baht and allowed it to fluctuate versus the dollar .
The resulting `` managed float '' immediately proved unmanageable .
The baht 's fall triggered a regional currency and equity cascade .
As it swept from Bangkok through Kuala Lumpur , Manila and Jakarta to Seoul and Hong Kong , upbeat exponents of `` Asia rising , '' `` the East Asian model , '' and an imminent `` Pacific century '' barely had time to edit these phrases from their screens and diskettes .
A few early warnings had been sounded .
The World Bank had worried about trends in Thailand before July .
And some skeptics , such as the MIT economist Paul Krugman , had doubted that East Asia 's breakneck economic pace could be sustained .
Nevertheless , most analysts were sanguine and slow to reconsider .
But in hindsight it is clear that for much of Asia , 1997 was an annus horribilis .
The crisis appeared to have abated in some countries earlier this year , notably Thailand and South Korea , but it worsened in Indonesia , Southeast Asia 's largest economy , where President Suharto has finally been forced to resign .
These days most observers expect the crisis , or its aftershocks at any rate , to endure into 1999 if not beyond .
In 1997 five East Asian stock markets _ those of Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , South Korea and Thailand _ lost more than three-fifths of their value in dollars .
Economic , environmental and health problems due to Indonesia 's prolonged drought and forest fires compounded these shocks in maritime Southeast Asia .
Meanwhile , Japan 's economy remained in doldrums that have lasted seven years , longer than any other lapse in that country 's growth since World War II .
As for China , financially hemorrhaging state enterprises continue to threaten stability across the Middle Kingdom .
The ramifications of East Asia 's crisis go beyond the region .
And they amount to more than the question the media keep asking : `` Who else will catch the Asian flu ? ''
In the United States , the rupturing of optimism about East Asia seems to tip the balance between the two most widely discussed positions about the dynamics of power in the post-Cold War world .
For one thing , the Asian financial crisis ravaged the credibility of a supposedly distinctive East Asian , or Japanese , model of economic growth based on cooperation between conglomerates _ Japan 's keiretsu , South Korea 's chaebol , Indonesia 's konglomerat _ and astute government officials .
Collapsing Asian markets revealed the crony capitalism beneath the surface of East Asia 's `` developmental state . ''
Second , the Asian crisis reduced the chances of a trans-Pacific `` clash of civilizations . ''
Falling growth rates and mounting losses in dollars jeopardized the resources and self-confidence that leaders of the Asian world would need were they to challenge the West .
The crisis damaged the Asian leg in the tripod model favored by those who expected power after the Cold War to coalesce around three regional blocs , each with its respective hinterland and hub : East Asia fanning out from Tokyo , the Americas centered on Washington , and Europe led from Brussels .
`` Head to head to head '' competition became less plausible as the Asian head became less formidable .
Given all of this , American observers especially were prone to believe that just as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 had vindicated the American political model _ liberal democracy _ so the fall of Asia 's markets in 1997 proved the wisdom of the American economic model _ free-market capitalism .
Yet it is presumptuous to think that the crisis foretells Asian acceptance of American ways _ that Americans can now truthfully sing , `` We are the world . ''
Indeed , East Asia 's diversity _ historical , cultural , political , economic _ ensured that the crisis would affect each country differently .
And that has meant different explanations as to why the trauma occurred and what still needs to be done .
For Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , to cite a vocal example , anything-goes American capitalism was not the solution .
It was the problem .
Blaming the crisis on arbitrageurs and hedge fund managers such as American financier George Soros , Mahathir proposed global controls on money trading that appalled Washington .
The American model is hardly monolithic , and the issue of how to resolve the Asian crisis has become contentious among Americans themselves .
On the same page of the Wall Street Journal , one expert called for higher taxes and lower spending while another advised the opposite .
A third recommended doing nothing at all .
Especially controversial have been the International Monetary Fund 's efforts to help resolve the crisis .
Deputy Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers , for instance , defends the IMF and its prescriptions as crucial to Asia 's recovery .
But Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs claims it has made matters worse , while former Secretary of State George Shultz recommends its abolition .
Who can say which of these men stands for the real American model ?
Yet , Asians have been under mounting pressure to believe that freer markets and freer politics could have prevented the crisis in the first place , or at least mitigated its effects .
As if the prescription of political freedom were a cure for East Asia 's economic ills , South Korean President Kim Dae Jung blames the Asian crisis squarely on authoritarian rule .
`` In every country in Asia , including Korea , '' he has said , `` the major reason for ( economic ) failure was lack of democracy . ''
But a comparison between South Korea and Singapore does not confirm Kim 's sweeping belief in lack of democracy as the major reason for the economic setback in every country in Asia .
For example , in 1997 - 98 the value of South Korean stocks was set back more in dollar terms than Singaporean equities , despite the greater lack of political freedom in Singapore .
In his own allocation of blame for the Asian crisis , Singapore 's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has suggested that what distinguishes the unscathed from the damaged is not political democracy but good governance of the economy .
Singaporeans , Lee said , are not champions of human rights or democracy , `` but we are very fastidious in the way in which we run our business , and on financial matters we are completely aboveboard . ''
Lee also in effect acknowledged that not all `` Asian values '' are constructive .
`` One of the weaknesses of Confucianism , '' he noted , is nepotism .
The economies least able to resist the crisis are those where nepotism _ `` the bane of East Asian countries , '' in his words _ is most entrenched .
But the views of Kim and Lee are more compatible than they first appear .
Electoral democracy can undermine good governance in the absence of the rule of law .
And good governance in a liberal democracy requires public servants who are insulated from the blandishments of special interests and the passions and whims of momentary majorities .
The economies of East Asia are in a race to leave 1997 behind .
The leaders _ Japan , Taiwan , and Hong Kong _ are politically much freer than Indonesia , the laggard .
And in 1998 East Asia is changing _ one hopes for the better _ but it is not Americanizing .
It is important for Americans to think realistically , not wishfully , about the region .
Certainly we may conclude that it is far too early to reinvent the debunked East Asian miracle as any new parable about `` Asia rising '' toward liberal democracy .
