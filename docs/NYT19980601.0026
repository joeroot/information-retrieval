LALAS DOESN ' T SEE RED IN CALM RETURN
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By JIM GREENIDGE c.1998 The Boston Globe
FOXBOROUGH , Mass. _ MetroStars defender Alexi Lalas claimed that Sunday 's game against the Revolution , his former team , was no different than most .
It was an away game against an Eastern Conference opponent below New York-New Jersey in the standings .
`` I had two great years here and the fans came to the stadium and were great to me , '' said Lalas .
`` It wasn n't an opportunity to get revenge or anything like that .
There 's no ill will between me and the organization or Thomas ( Rongen ) or any of the players .
We 're friends on and off the field . ''
In fact , Lalas said hello to Rongen , and the Revolution coach said hello back .
`` Thomas and I still talk and I value him as a friend and as someone that gives good advice , '' Lalas said after his team 's shootout win over the Revolution following a 1 - 1 regulation tie .
`` He 's a class coach and a class individual . ''
Lalas , who performed well , looked different than when he played here .
His distinctive red hair is much shorter these days , cut in San Diego two weeks ago .
`` It 's a big change , boredom , all that combined , '' he said .
`` It was a result of living my life in other cities , so my only form of entertainment is the local mall .
I got a haircut because I had seen all the movies . ''
His long goatee remains , however .
As do Lalas 's numerous fans here , particularly those in the end zone , one of whom continues to wear a red wig of about the same length as Lalas 's former hairstyle .
Lalas wasn n't trying to gain revenge on the Revolution for trading him or trying to look good for the US national team , for which he 'll probably be a reserve in the World Cup .
`` I don n't have to prove myself to anybody , I 've been around long enough , '' he said .
`` I know what I can do . ''
It seems Lalas much prefers to play in front of the New England rooters than those who watch the MetroStars at Giants Stadium .
`` It 's a lot different than New York , the people who come to the game , there 's a lot less pressure on a player here , '' Lalas said .
`` The expectations are kind of different here , and that makes it easier to play .
Playing in New York , for that type of fan , with such incredible expectations , also makes it an incredible feeling when you have that support when they finally give it to you .
`` I 'm still waiting , '' he added , half-chuckling .
`` But I think it 's going to be great . ''
Lalas , who still lives in Weston during the offseason , was in the spotlight at times Sunday .
In the 74th minute , he and Revolution defender Dahir Mohammed were given yellow cards , after Lalas sat on Mohammed .
`` He 's just a punk , '' said Lalas of Mohammed .
`` He 's got no respect .
The only reason that the whole thing happened was he started kicking ( goaltender ) Tony ( Meola ) , and as a defender I have to defend my goalkeeper .
I can n't let anything happen , so I sat on him . ''
Lalas was his team 's seventh shooter in the shootout , the teams tied at 2 at the time , but his bid was knocked down by Revolution goalkeeper Jeff Causey .
`` I was trying to push it by him and I waited a second too long , '' Lalas said .
`` When you 're my size '' _ 6 feet 3 inches _ `` waiting a second compared to waiting a second for someone Johnny Torres 's size '' _ Torres is 5 - 6 _ `` is two totally different things . ''
