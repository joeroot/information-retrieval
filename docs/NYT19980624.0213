CIR-WINDOWS98 ( Undated ) _ What a difference three years make !
When Windows 95 finally made its way out the door , Microsoft Corp. promoted it to the cheeky beat of the Rolling Stones ' `` Start Me Up . ''
Windows 98 ?
Dullsville .
Thursday 's official release flaunts the bland slogan , `` Works Better , Plays Better . ''
The CD ?
It comes with a Microsoft commercial appropriately set to a pop adaptation of a theme from Beethoven 's Piano Sonata ( Op .
13 ) , the `` Pathetique . ''
For all its failings , Windows 95 was in many ways , big and small , a significant improvement over its predecessor , Windows 3.1 , particularly in its ability to run multiple programs at once .
But when it arrived , one reviewer ( this one ) described it as `` an edifice built of baling wire , chewing gum and prayer . ''
Windows 98 adds duct tape , caulk and pesticide .

HAND-PAINTED-WALLPAPER ( New York ) _ It took 12 years for Elizabeth Dow to perfect a method of hand-painting wallpapers so subtly they appear to glow from within , like a letter held up to a lamp .
But don n't ask her how she did it .
Everything about the process _ from the recipe cards for the pigments of her imagination to her glues and the shape of the fans for drying the paper _ is a secret guarded as zealously as the formula for Chanel No. 5.
By Julie Iovine .
DOGS-AND-PEOPLE ( New York ) _ `` Don n't eat the eyes . ''
Now there 's a sentence to consider .
You could either be having dinner in Chinatown _ or talking to a dog .
In this case , Caroline Knapp , the author of the best-selling memoir , `` Drinking : A Love Story '' ( Dial Press , 1996 ) is addressing Lucille , her 3-year-old German shepherd mix , who has been systematically gutting a stuffed animal _ a lemming , to be exact .
Ms. Knapp remains calm in the face of annihilation .
She has written a new book , `` Pack of Two : The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs '' ( Dial Press ) , a thoughtful , sensitive analysis of the all-out love affair she unexpectedly found in her relationship with Lucille and that other people , especially women , find with their own dogs .

NY-REAL-ESTATE ( New York ) _ There 's a kind of hush , all over New York _ New York 's residential real estate market , that is .
Whether hush or hiccup or breathing spell _ all terms used by brokers to describe the market since the beginning of June _ the city 's biggest companies agree on one thing : the frenzy has abated , at least for now .
By Tracie Rozhon .
HOLOGRAMS ( Undated ) _ Crossing the swimming pool with the relentlessness of a Stephen Spielberg tracking shot , the twin shark mouths on the kid 's goggles splash bits of green and orange and purple : they are the holographic images of hungry shark faces on the lenses of Speedo 's new hologram goggles .
The wearer can look through the goggles , but the viewer sees the shark faces or , alternately , shark eyes .
Holograms are shimmering across placemats , mugs , summer toys and movie tie-ins .
NY-HARLEM-SHOWHOUSSE ( New York ) _ It ain n't just paint .
It 's wallcoverings : marble dust , Butcher 's Wax , Formica laminate and mosaic floor tiles .
All were used to decorate the walls of the first Harlem United Show House , which is open through July 12 in the Hamilton Heights Historic District .

PHILLY-GARDEN ( Philadelphia ) _ Chris Woods , 45 , strode through the entrance court at Chanticleer , the public garden here , where he has worked since 1983 , the last nine years as executive director and chief horticulturist .
`` It 's a dream job , '' he said .
`` Thirty-one acres , 10 gardens , 10 expert gardeners and an annual maintenance budget of a million dollars . ''
By Mac Griswold .
CALIF-MERCHANT-STREET ( Los Angeles ) _ Merchant Street is a tattered row of produce warehouses and auto body shops , its littered sidewalk and cracked street home to the poor and drug addicts .
This is not a pretty part of town , but here in the heart of Los Angeles ' Skid Row is a jewel .
At the back of an asphalt parking lot , in a wall decorated with dancing colored letters , a door gives a view into a charming urban courtyard .
A cheerful ceramic fountain surrounded by ripening orange trees is covered in hand-painted hearts , fruits , flowers and birds .
Youngsters are cleaning their paintbrushes under the spray .
A circle of six year olds sits inside the building , absorbed in painting self-portraits .
This is Inner City Arts , a non-profit arts school that is both an enlightened model for arts education and a design landmark where education is embellished by architectural example .
