U.S. Security Officials Meet to Respond to Iraq 's Promise
WASHINGTON , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Top U.S. Security officials are having an urgent meeting at the White House to discuss how to respond to Iraq 's promise to resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors .
Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume without conditions and inspectors would be allowed to return immediately , U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah said Saturday .
The response could avert a U.S. military attack .
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan responded to the promise , saying that the promise was " positive " and met all requirements of the U.N. Security Council .
Shah said the Iraqi leadership sent a letter to Annan saying that they will allow the work of inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume at suspected weapons sites .
There are " no conditions ...
in this letter , " Shah said .
Earlier in the day before Iraq officially announced the promise , White House on Saturday demanded " concrete and demonstratable actions " that Saddam Hussein will allow the return of U.N. weapons inspectors .
The U.S. had started a military buildup in the Gulf to prepare for possible military strike against Iraq .
But the Clinton administration has repeatedly said Baghdad can avoid being attacked by compliance .
