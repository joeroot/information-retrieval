Sudan Rebuffs U.S. Threats of New Attacks
KHARTOUM , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Sudanese President Omar Bashir has categorically rejected new threats by the U.S. to deal new strikes against his country .
He reiterated Sudan 's right to respond forcefully to any fresh U.S. attacks , other than resorting to the U.N. Security Council or other international organization .
He was addressing a huge mass meeting Sunday on the occasion of the lapse of one month since the U.S. air strike against a pharmaceutical factory here .
Bashir said the U.S. threats were made under the pretext that Sudan is hosting terrorists who undermine American interests worldwide .
Such threats will fail to intimidate or terrorize the Sudanese nation , he said .
Bashir revealed that the threat was contained in an unsigned message received from the U.S. Administration .
Washington threatened to hit Sudan in case of any attacks against U.S. interests and facilities the world over , he said .
News reports said the message had been conveyed by a U.S. official to a Sudanese official .
The president also said the Sudanese hostility to the U.S. Administration emanates from Washington 's attempts to impose hegemony on Sudan and to force the people to abandon their religion and independent decision making .
