Kenya to Plug Loophole in Port Agents ' Fees
NAIROBI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- The Kenya Port Authority ( KPA ) is to take action against unscrupulous freight forwarders and " briefcase " agents who have been extracting fictitious port fees from users , especially those from land-locked Uganda .
East African , a local weekly , reported Monday that the KPA is preparing commercials with clear information on the Mombasa port 's full range of services and charges for broadcast on Ugandan radio and television .
KPA 's resident representative in Kampala Ismail Mboya was quoted as saying that unscrupulous freight forwarders and briefcase agents have long been exploiting Ugandan port users , billing them for items which did not exist in KPA tariff schedules .
Among items irregularly charged to Ugandan port users by such agents is " miscellaneous main gate charges , " said Mboya .
" There is no such item in our billing system , nor does any other levying agency , such as the Kenya Revenue Authority , " he said .
Prior to the establishment of the KPA marketing office in Kampala , there was a lot of misinformation about port charges and services emanating mainly from freight forwarders taking advantage of unsuspecting clients , he said .
Many Ugandan importers were unaware of an eight-day grace period for cargo in KPA 's bonded warehouses to allow for the processing of documents .
" It is only after the expiry of this period that the port can start levying demurrage charges , " he said .
Many shippers , said Mboya , had been billed for late entries by the agents and the use of bonded warehouses right from the moment their cargo was discharged .
Ugandan cargo handled by the port of Mombasa in Kenya has increased considerably in the past 10 years from about 200,000 tons in 1988 to 1.6 million tons handled in 1996 .
This accounted for more than half of the total transit traffic of 2.6 million tons that passed through the port the same year .
