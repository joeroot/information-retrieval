NEW YORK _ Waves of selling by investors large and small engulfed the stock market Monday .
They erased all the market 's gains this year and sent stock prices down more than 19 percent from their peak just six weeks ago , the sharpest decline in eight years .
The frenzied selling offered little solace to investors who had hoped that the stock market 's recent slump , which began with worries over unsettled economic conditions in Asia and accelerated as financial troubles in Russia came to light , might be stayed by the fundamental strength of the American economy .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points , or 6.4 percent , to 7539.07 , leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent below where it started the year .
The decline was the index 's second-largest in point terms , behind the 554-point drop on Oct. 27 , but did not rank in the top 20 when measured in percent .
The Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 index , a broader measure of the market 's overall health , fell more than 69 points , or nearly 7 percent , to 958.53 , down 1.3 percent since the beginning of 1998 .
While there were few signs of panic among individual investors Monday , market participants said that heavy selling by mutual fund companies , responding to withdrawals by individual investors from equity mutual funds over the weekend and Monday , played a significant role in Monday 's decline , including the selling frenzy that sent the Dow average falling by 250 points in the last half hour of trading .
The selloff in stocks also prompted a big rally in the bond market , where investors from around the world have sought shelter in securities that are backed by the American government .
The price of 30-year Treasury bonds rose 1 8 / 32 , to 103 22 / 32 , while their yield , which moves in the opposite direction , fell to a record low of 5.25 percent .
Economists and financial analysts said Monday 's stock-market decline is almost certain to bring intense pressure to bear on the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates .
For more than a week , some short-term interest rates have been higher than long-term rates , a situation that is a classic precursor to a recession .
But Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Monday that the economy remains sound , although he acknowledged that `` the world is currently working its way through a difficult period . ''
Rubin and Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , who is on vacation but who was in touch with Rubin Monday , are scheduled to meet on Friday with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in California .
Whatever the cause of the financial difficulties that have plagued Asia and Russia over the past year , economists say , the stock market 's recent activity indicates that those troubles have begun to wash up on America 's shores .
`` This is the first time in a long time where the future of the American economy hinges so much on what happens to American stock prices , '' said Henry Kaufman , a New York economist .
`` We are having a global financial problem , and it is a problem that can not go away quickly .
If there are further declines in the equity market , there should be an orchestrated reduction in interest rates by the major industrial countries , '' including the United States , Germany , England , France , Italy and Japan .
The scope of the current problem facing the economy and the financial markets seems to have permeated the consciousness of individual investors , who have been the stalwart supporters of the bull market in stocks for the last several years .
Mutual fund companies , including Fidelity Investments , the country 's largest fund company , said they continued to see withdrawals from stock funds over the weekend and Monday , with most of those investors moving cash out of stock funds and into money-market or bond funds .
Bearing the brunt of Monday 's selloff were many of the technology stocks that have been the most popular with individual investors and the mutual funds in which they invest .
The Nasdaq composite index , the major market index most heavily populated with technology issues , fell 140 points , or 8.6 percent , to 1499.25 _ its worst single-day decline when measured in points and the fourth-worth in terms of percent .
The Nasdaq index is now 4.5 percent below the level where it started the year .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange measured 914.7 million shares , the third-heaviest ever on the Bog Board , and the number of stocks that declined exceed those that advanced by a ratio of more than seven to one .
Exceptionally heavy volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange caused a systems problem near the end of trading .
But despite that glitch , Rubin said that the financial market 's mechanisms worked `` effectively . ''
The Dow industrial average has declined nearly 1,799 points , or 19.2 percent , from its highest-ever closing price of 9337.97 on July 17 .
That is slightly less , in percentage terms , than the 21.2 percent loss in the index 's value in the bear market of 1990 , which lasted from mid-June through early October .
To some traders and stock-market analysts , Monday 's decline took on some of the characteristics of a selling frenzy , the type of relentless liquidation of investors ' portfolios that comes only at the point of maximum pessimism .
`` The only good thing I see is that they are finally going after the sacred cows , the drugs and the retail stocks and the technology sector , '' said Henry Herrmann , chief investment officer at Waddell & AMP ; Reed , an Overland Park , Kan. mutual fund company .
Until Monday , those stocks had provided investors with a sort of refuge from the storm of the market 's recent decline .
`` When they are pounding the stocks that wouldn n't go down , that tells me that the sentiment is really negative , '' Herrmann said .
`` And when the sentiment gets that negative , you can get a reversal pretty quick . ''
