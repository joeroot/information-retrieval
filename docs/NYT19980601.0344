SOCCER HERO WHO PLOTTED HIS OWN DOWNFALL

LONDON _ There are some moments that may have swayed the English football coach 's mind against the mercurial midfielder .
It may have been the free-kick which he insisted on taking , then trundled straight to the first Moroccan defender .
Or perhaps it was the off-the-ball kick at Belgium 's Vital Borkelmans .
It could have the times he was caught in possession , the times he gave the ball away , the times he raged at the referee .
All of these things Glenn Hoddle saw as he watched Paul Gascoigne playing in Morocco last week .
Most telling of all , however , were the constant little breaks for a breather .
All this nagged away at Hoddle 's mind as he considered his England team this weekend and then he acted .
Hoddle , who has backed Gascoigne over his wife-beating , his `` re-fuelling '' problems , his late nights and early baths , finally accepted that this prodigal son could not be kept in the fold .
It is a `` football and fitness '' issue but it is impossible to separate the way Gascoigne lives his life from the effect it has on both .
Watching him in Morocco , the idea that he would once again lead England to World Cup glory seemed fanciful .
The precocious talent of Italia90 is older , slower , but no more mature .
He remains the best passer in the side but his growing vulnerability affects the whole balance of the team and , by extension , the squad .
If Gascoigne plays , Hoddle has to pick Ince and Batty to compensate for his lack of mobility and his tendency to give the ball away in dangerous areas .
That means the front players get isolated and , with Teddy Sheringham out of form , the team lose cohesion .
So much of England 's World Cup planning had been based around Gascoigne .
It is not that Hoddle was clinging on to a romantic vision of what he once was .
It is because , as was evident against Chile and Switzerland , there appeared no alternative .
Now he must find one .
David Beckham can see and play a pass but he has not got the pace and dribbling to go past people .
The reverse applies to Steve McManaman , while Paul Merson , who has a bit of both , often struggles to impose himself on the game .
Paul Scholes is a possibility but it could be Darren Anderton .
He may still be feeling his way back into regular football but he can attack defenses with the ball or pass it through them .
Gascoigne was on the playing field for 170 minutes in the three games against Saudi Arabia , Belgium and Morocco this last week but he only played in short bursts .
Some of these teasingly hinted at his quality .
The dribble and shot against the Saudis , a reverse pass that opened up space for Rob Lee against Belgium .
However , it was not enough .
On Friday , after the Belgium game , Glenn Hoddle had said : `` He needs to get fitter and sharper but he 's worked extremely hard and he 's still got time . ''
Not any more .
At 31 , Gascoigne may yet come back , although it will depend upon how he reacts to this blow .
Hoddle had added : `` There 's no question that he has the talent , that he can pass the ball .
He proved to me in the four matches he put together for me last year ( France , Brazil , Moldova , Italy ) that he can do it still .
`` People have asked me in the past if he 'd ever come back fully but I think he 's given the answer on the pitch .
He nailed it to the mast with performances like the one he gave in Rome . ''
If Gascoigne fails to revive his career , if he instead wallows in self-pity with the aid of his celebrity friends , Rome may prove to be his final hurrah with England .
It was a high note to go out on , but far too premature .
