China Backs Merging of Securities Firms
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Beijing Securities Co. Ltd was set up here today as an important move to foster the merging of securities companies into large groups .
With a total registered capital of 850 million yuan ( about 102.4 million yuan ) , Beijing Securities evolved out of the former Beijing Securities and Beijing Fiscal Securities companies , becoming the seventh biggest securities company in the country .
Economists have hailed the move as another new and important step to encourage the formation of big securities companies , following the setting up of Eastern Securities and Union Securities late last year , each with total assets of more than one billion yuan .
A total of 450 companies and institutions are engaged in the securities brokerage business in China at the moment , with total assets of nearly 160 billion yuan .
However , economists say that Chinese securities companies , large in number as they are , still lack a competitive edge on the whole , and merger and reorganization should be encouraged so as to foster large-scale and powerful securities brokerages .
As the major securities institution in Beijing , Beijing Securities has reported good business in the past few years .
It has been the lead or supporting underwriter of 35 shares , and its turnover of securities and treasury bonds last year was listed as one of the highest among its peers .
