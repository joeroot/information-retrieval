Cost of signing picks , court action may force change

1998 , Houston Chronicle & LR ; & QL ; The annual draft of college and high school baseball players _ an exercise that for decades was locked in time as the rest of sport 's economic picture took wing _ takes place today amid questions about its future viability .
The first pick in the draft belongs to the Philadelphia Phillies , a team that spent 11 { months holding strong in the face of the explosive growth of contract demands by top selections .
Last June , the Phillies took outfielder J.D .
Drew with the second overall pick but refused to pay the reported $ 11 million signing bonus demanded by Drew .
Drew is back in the draft this year , but the Phillies will not select him .
They are expected to take third baseman Pat Burrell of the University of Miami , a player whose demands are expected to be far less than Drew 's and whom the Phillies believe they will be able to sign .
The latest word among draft prognosticators is that the Oakland Athletics , who have the No. 2 pick , also will not select Drew .
Nor will the Chicago Cubs or Kansas City Royals .
Drew could fall to fifth , where he might be selected by St. Louis .
Whatever the results , it 's a given that bonuses for unproven players will continue to skyrocket .
As salaries for major-league players went through the roof in the 1980s and '90s , bonus money for amateurs remained relatively static .
That changed two years ago when four first-round draft picks parlayed a loophole in the tendering of contracts into becoming free agents .
As often is the case in baseball , teams couldn n't control themselves .
A bidding war for the four players resulted in the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks paying $ 10.2 million for first baseman Travis Lee and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays giving $ 10 million to righthander John Patterson _ nearly five times the record signing bonus for a drafted player .
Agent Scott Boras , who is the adviser for Drew , used those figures as the benchmark for the 1997 collegiate Player of the Year .
The Phillies offered a package that would have been worth a reported $ 6 million ; Boras and Drew declined to sign .
All of which leads at least one veteran baseball executive to wonder if the draft has outlived its usefulness .
Astros president Tal Smith , who was around when the draft was instituted in 1965 as a way to hold down bonuses to amateur players , isn n't sure the initial purpose of the draft is viable today .
`` There 's some uncertainty to the future of the draft , '' said Smith .
`` It was instituted for economic reasons , and a lot of reasons it was instituted don n't apply these days .
Absolutely , the draft has changed .
`` There 's been a dramatic change the last couple years .
You look at the J.D .
Drew situation , and what the Diamondbacks and Devils Rays did a couple years ago , and you can see what is happening . ''
In the late 1950s and early 1960s , teams stocked their farm systems by scouting and signing players without the restriction of a draft .
Smith , who worked for the Cincinnati Reds in the late '50s , said the Milwaukee Braves , New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers pushed the envelope by paying huge bonuses to players .
In the early 1960s , some teams were paying more in bonus money to unproven players than they were to their major-league players .
Baseball executives instituted the draft as a way to hold down bonuses and help teams maintain a competitive balance .
However , the trend toward huge bonus payouts has come back around even with the draft in place .
Rice pitcher Matt Anderson , the No. 1 overall pick in 1998 , signed with the Detroit Tigers for a $ 2.505 million bonus , the all-time high among drafted players .
That bonus likely will be surpassed this season .
Since teams with high picks in the draft often are those that have been forced to the bottom of the standings because of economic constraints in their payroll structure , the idea of achieving competitive balance through the draft might be a thing of the past .
Draft proponents claim big-market teams like the Yankees , Dodgers and Atlanta Braves would dominate the signing of amateur players if the draft were abolished .
However , teams that relied on strong scouting might be able to use their money more wisely if they weren n't forced into paying top picks the huge bonuses they currently receive .
`` If you 're a second-division club , the draft sort of works against you the way it is now , '' said Smith .
`` If you draft first , second or third , the ( signing ) costs have risen so much it may preclude from signing the top players .
I 'm not certain the draft works best for the teams at the bottom .
`` If you 're a second-division or small-market club that has to rely on scouting and development , the draft works against you in that you get only one of 30 picks ( one each round ) .
`` If you had an opportunity to sell your team as a way to reach the majors more quickly or appeal to players on a regional basis , you might have a better chance . ''
Smith 's views are not held by the majority of baseball executives , including acting commissioner Bud Selig .
So the draft is not about to go away _ unless Boras and Drew try to use the court system to unravel it .
In one regard , this year 's draft will remain the same in an important area .
Unlike the drafts in other professional sports , which are televised live amid much hoopla , baseball goes about its selection process in virtual secrecy .
Only first-round picks will be announced today ; the rest of the draft lists will be released next week .
The reason ?
Baseball believes colleges would increase scholarship offers to high school players selected in higher rounds , making it more difficult to sign the players and costing teams more in bonus money .
However , there is a rising feeling among baseball people to go public with the draft and televise the proceedings to gain some needed publicity .
`` There 's a ton of interest , '' says San Diego general manager Kevin Towers .
`` You can n't overestimate the interest in college baseball and the impact of high school baseball , especially at the small-town level . ''
The Astros have the No. 17 pick in the first round .
According to a mock draft in Baseball America , a publication that studies and analyzes each year 's draft with a high degree of success , the Astros are expected to select high school pitcher Pat Strange , a righthander from Springfield , Mass.
However , Baseball America predicts that Rice outfielder Bubba Crosby will be available when the Astros pick in the first round .
If Crosby indeed is still on the board , the Astros might be tempted to take him .
Last year , the Astros took power-hitting Lance Berkman from Rice in the first round .
