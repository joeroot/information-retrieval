Indonesian President Promises Clean , Fair Election
JAKARTA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie Thursday reaffirmed his government 's commitment to holding a clean , fair and democratic general election which the international community is free to observe .
" Through this election , we will see which force would get the people 's support and which would not , " Habibie told the 350 Indonesian and foreign participants of the Indonesian Forum whom he received at the State Palace here .
The president said his government will invite observers from the United Nations Development Program , the United States , Germany , France , Japan and Australia to see for themselves if Indonesia 's general election is held democratically .
Meanwhile , Minister of Internal Affairs Syarwan Hamid said that the Bill on Politics , which is being deliberated in the House of Representatives ( DPR ) , would be passed into law by the end of January 1999 , making the next general election be undertaken no sooner than in mid-June 1999 .
" It is estimated that it will need at least four months after the sanctioning of the law on politics that a general election can be undertaken .
It will be difficult to hold election earlier because there are many preparations to do , " Syarwan told reporters here on Thursday following a limited cabinet meeting on politics and security .
The preparations include the forming of an Election Committee and the selection of political parties which are eligible to contest in the election .
