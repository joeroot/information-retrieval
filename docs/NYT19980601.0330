STEPHEN FRY 'S WALK ON THE WILDE SIDE
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By RENEE GRAHAM c.1998 The Boston Globe
Spend time with Stephen Fry , and one can almost envision what it might have been like in the company of Oscar Wilde .
First , there is his face : the expressive , sad eyes , the fleshy features uninterrupted by sharp angles , the full , pronounced jaw suggesting gentle imprudence .
Even in a green-and-beige jersey with his dark hair trimmed back from Wildean lengths , Fry so resembles Wilde , he could pass for a descendant of the great Irish-born playwright , novelist , and bon vivant .
Still more importantly , there is Fry 's wit , a great unbridled thing legendary in his native England , at turns erudite , scatological , provocative , and violently funny .
An accomplished author , like Wilde he is the quintessential dinner guest turning even casual conversation into a brilliant feast to be savored _ rare , filling , and delicious .
Spend time with Stephen Fry , and it 's impossible to imagine anyone else playing Oscar Wilde , which Fry does magnificently in `` Wilde , '' a new film biography opening Friday .
In many ways , Fry seems born to play Wilde , author of such works as `` The Picture of Dorian Grey '' and `` The Importance of Being Earnest . ''
Often hailed as the first true celebrity , a man who relished fame and public adoration , Wilde died in disgrace and poverty after he was convicted of `` gross indecency '' for his then-scandalous affair with a young nobleman , Lord Alfred Douglas .
He died in 1900 at age 46 , a few years after completing a two-year sentence .
For most his 40 years , Fry , perhaps best known to American audiences as the manservent Jeeves of PBS 's `` Jeeves and Wooster , '' has been told of his resemblance to Wilde .
In his hilarious introduction to a bound edition of the film 's screenplay by Julian Mitchell , Fry writes he `` was told it with gathering frequency as my girth thickened and the flesh on my face began to record every plate of pasta and every glass of vodka and tonic that had been pushed through it . ''
With his unconventioal looks , Fry knows he will never garner the sorts of roles offered Tom Cruise or Leonardo DiCaprio _ `` If you are British , '' he writes , `` voiced like an old wireless set , approaching 40 at dangerous speed , well over six feet in height , amply padded to the point of minor obesity and endowed with a complexion not unlike that of freshly applied window putty , there are few leading roles for which you are suited . ''
But he has always wanted to play Wilde .
`` There 's a physical similarity which , of course , is not in and of itself sufficient to play someone .
But it puts it in your head when people say it enough , '' said Fry recently , between frequent cigarettes in his Boston hotel room .
`` It became something I wanted to do for some time , and this struck me as being the one .
This struck me as having all the elements that made making a new film a good idea .
There didn n't seem much point in just showing the same old Wilde , a rather fallacious Wilde , the posturing , brittle , camp arch figure . ''
& QL ; & QL ; Love of Wilde
& QL ; & QL ;
Fry discovered the author as a child , recalling his eventual reverence for him like `` a slow falling in love rather than an explosive one .
`` I fell in love with him in stages .
I fell in love with his writing first when I read ` The Importance of Being Earnest ' when I was quite small .
Then as a teenager I fell in love with his image in quite the shallow way that teenagers do , '' said Fry , who like Wilde , is gay .
`` I loved the paraphernalia that went with him , the cigarette holders , the loveliness , the artifice .
Then reading his biographies I fell in love with him because he was wise and kind and good natured and flawed and human . ''
The film , directed by Brian Gilbert , and also starring Jude Law , Jennifer Ehle , Vanessa Redgrave , Michael Sheen , and Tom Wilkinson , arrives in the midst of a significant Wilde revival in popular culture .
These days everyone , it seems , has something to say about the playwright .
Two recent plays in New York , Moises Kaufman 's `` Gross Indecency : The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde , '' and David Hare 's `` The Judas Kiss , '' starring Liam Neeson , dealt with Wilde 's downfall .
Several film adaptations of Wilde 's `` An Ideal Husband , '' his play about a politician embroiled in scandal , are chugging their way through the Hollywood pipeline .
And Wilde , who was a married father of two when he began his affair with Lord Douglas , nicknamed `` Bosie , '' has long been upheld as a gay icon and martyr persecuted and disgraced by a small-minded society , which may have sought to silence a man at odds with the strictures of Victorian England .
`` The terrible tragedy of it , and the irony is that 100 years on , he 's changed from being one of the most loathed and comtemptible of human beings , to someone who in some ways is a beacon to a lot of people , '' said Gilbert , who also directed the film `` Tom and Viv . ''
`` Also , uniquely among 19th - century figures , those titanic figures of that period , I think he 's really alive in the culture , '' he said .
`` That 's high and low _ he 's a pervasive influence .
He is claimed by writers , artists , rock stars , and film people . ''
The challenge of creating a Wilde biography is making him more than a paperbook of quotations and witticisms , Gilbert said .
Even Dorothy Parker , amply and able in any battle of wits , once said :
& QL ; ( begin poetry style ) & QL ; & QL ;
If , with the literate , I am
Impelled to try an epigram
I never seem to take the credit
We all assume that Oscar said it .
& QL ; ( end poetry style ) & QL ; & QL ;
Still , since there is no video of Wilde , Fry was not bound by tried-and-true representations of Wilde 's speech patterns or gestures .
`` I 'm glad I didn n't have the problems say Tony Hopkins had when he was playing Nixon , '' said referring to the Oliver Stone film biography .
`` Every single person who saw that film knew what Nixon looked like and knew these gestures with the fingers up , the slightly sloopy shoulders , the bandy legs .
( Hopkins ) had to do all those things just before he could begin to play him as he wanted to play .
With Wilde , all you need really is your hair parted in the middle . ''
Mitchell 's screenplay is based on the Richard Ellmann biography , and while there have been other films about Wilde , Gilbert feels his is the first to deal in detail _ some would say , explicitly _ with the all-consuming doomed love affair which wound up costing Wilde everything from his reputation to his children whom he never saw again after his imprisonment .
`` We had much more freedom and the opportunity to be candid about what caused the catastrophe , '' Gilbert said .
`` At the same time we don n't need to apologize for him anymore .
And let 's not trivialize his life and interpret it as it has always been interpreted , under the shadow of the scandal .
That 's a homophobic reading of Wilde as the vain , posturing , self-destructive yearning-for-martyrdom gay criminal . ''
& QL ; & QL ; Film has its critics
& QL ; & QL ;
Still , the film , which has received positive notices in New York and Los Angeles , has not been embraced by everyone .
Some have complained about a scene with Wilde watching Bosie have sex with a `` rent boy , '' a lovely young man whose carnal talents are for hire .
Especially critical is Merlin Holland , a writer and Wilde 's only grandchild .
When the film opened in London earlier this year , Holland charged it would leave `` those people unfamiliar with Wilde with an impression of him as a man who jumped in and out of bed with young men . ''
`` In history I don n't think there 's ever been a film which has been liked by the family , and it 'll never happen , '' Fry said .
`` But I can understand his feelings .
Yet , I think it would be dishonest to the film , the subject matter , and what the audience should go through to discreetly cut away to the mantelpiece when two people are making love .
`` We still are Victorian , we still are very hung up about what people do with their bodies , however modern we think they are , '' he added .
`` We may think we 're very cool about it , but we still have a salacious , prurient feeling about it .
In a way we 're worse because we 're even more hypocritical .
The Victorians had the honesty to be straight shocked and disgusted , whereas we pretend not be shocked and disgusted , although we 're quite troubled . ''
Fry , who lives in London , recently completed his role in the film adaptation of Jonathan Harr 's `` A Civil Action , '' parts of which were shot in the Boston area .
He is also writing a script based on John Kennedy Toole 's `` A Confederacy of Dunces . ''
While he has at last fulfilled his long-held desire to play Wilde , he emerged from this film an even greater admirer of the man who , almost a century since his disgrace and death , is again beguiling the world .
`` He was a great conversationalist , and his wit was wonderful and natural and unforced , even though when you read it , it 's beautifully shaped and the words are quite exotic , '' Fry said .
`` There are some really intelligent people who make you feel this high , and Wilde was of another breed which made you feel 10 feet tall .
He almost showed people how to be witty . ''
