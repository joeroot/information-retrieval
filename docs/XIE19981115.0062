65 Angolan Refugees Arrive in Zambias
LUSAKA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Some 65 Angolan refugees have arrived recently in Mwinilunga , Zambia 's Northwestern province , Home Affairs Minister Katele Kalumba said here Sunday .
He said the refugees arrived at a time when the Zambian government is making final preparations to repatriate Angolan refugees who came to the country in the past years .
Though his country has a liberal asylum policy toward asylum seekers , the situation is a matter of grave concern to the government because it is entrapped in a cycle of upheavals and attempted negotiations without an end in sight , he said .
Kalumba urged the Angolan government and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) to seek a negotiated settlement to the prolonged war in the country by abiding by the Lusaka Protocol signed by the two sides in 1994 .
He also called on Rwanda , Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo to take steps to encourage the voluntary return of their nationals from Zambia .
Currently , Zambia has about 130,000 refugees from Angola , Rwanda and Congo ( K ) .
