British Scientists Develop Drug for Chickenpox
LONDON , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- British scientists have developed the first drug that can cure chickenpox and shingles , The Sunday Times said Sunday .
The so-called Trojan Horse compound , expected to be used on the first human patients in the next 12 months , makes the virus self-destruct by tricking it into using the drug as a building block for its own DNA .
One of the problems in dealing with the chickenpox virus has been in finding ways of destroying it once it has caused an infection .
When a virus infects a person , it needs to expand rapidly and it does this by hijacking the host DNA .
Professor Chris McGuigan and colleagues at Cardiff University have created a compound that mimics a nucleoside , which the virus mistakes for a real DNA building brick .
The compound , designed to look sufficiently like the real thing to trick the virus , has enough differences for human bodies to recognize it as a fake .
" It 's a bit like the Trojan Horse idea in that these molecules go into the cells and the virus believes them to be the real components of DNA and builds its own DNA on them , " Professor McGuigan was quoted as saying .
