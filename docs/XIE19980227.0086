Chinese Edible Oil Market to Reach Balance
BEIJING , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The supply of edible oil on the Chinese market will be basically balanced with the demand this year .
This was revealed in a survey report jointly released today by the State Planning Commission and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences .
The country 's edible oil consumption is estimated at 15 million tons this year , up 4.7 percent compared to last year , and its domestic supply will be 7.25 million tons of vegetable oil and 3.35 million tons of animal fat , in addition to 1.15 tons of edible oil in inventory .
So , China has planned to import more than three million tons of edible oil this year .
The report said that the improvement of per ha edible oil output is the only way to raise the domestic supply , because the country 's rapid industrialization has inevitably resulted in a decrease in arable land .
China will boost the output of rapeseeds and peanuts by 10 million tons in next few years , the report said .
The country has so far achieved a basic balance between the supply and demand for edible oil , thanks to the good harvests in the output of oil-bearing crops for several years running as well as a stable consumption volume .
So , little fluctuation is expected in the edible oil price this year , according to the report .
