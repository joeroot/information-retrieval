Israel Appears Reluctant to Apologize Over Swiss
JERUSALEM , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Israel appeared Thursday reluctant to officially apologize to Switzerland for the espionage case that has chilled the otherwise friendly bilateral relations .
Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that one agent of Israeli secret spy agency Mossad is detained by Swiss police .
He only said Israel is dealing with the matter and would do everything needed to solve the problem , but without giving further comments .
Following the news conference held in Swiss capital Bern by Swiss judicial officials to detail the failed Mossad operation last week , Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur immediately convened a meeting of ministry officials to discuss the implications of the incident .
Israel Radio said one of the assessments made at the meeting was that the arrested Mossad agent would be put on speedy trial and expelled by the Swiss authorities within weeks .
Since Israeli Ambassador to Switzerland has already expressed regret to Bern over the affair last week , thus Israel tends not to offer official apology .
But Swiss authorities are insisting that Israel must officially apologize for the affair despite the traditional friendly relations between the two countries .
Bern charged Israel for violating its sovereignty and the international law .
It was reported that Switzerland originally preferred to solve the case quietly through diplomatic channels , but the release of the failed Mossad operation by Israeli media Wednesday prompted Swiss government to publicize the case .
Swiss officials said five Mossad agents were caught when trying to bug telephone lines in a private building in Bern on February 19 , but only one of the agents was detained .
Arrest warrants have been also issued to the other four agents , who are believed to have already fled the country .
Switzerland denied that the Mossad agents tried to spy on someone who has connections with Iran , Israel 's arch enemy .
But others speculated that Mossad 's target might be related to the pro-Iran guerrilla forces Hezbollah ( Party of God ) , which is fighting a tough war against Israeli occupation of South Lebanon .
Political analysts here expected the case to be settled soon due to the friendly relations between Israel and Switzerland .
But what caused the highest concern among Israeli leadership is the shocking disclosure of the highly secret Mossad operation at a time when the agency is at its lowest point following last September 's failure to assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan .
The failed operation in Bern was believed to be the major reason behind Mossad chief Danny Yatom 's resignation Tuesday .
Yatom , who was held responsible for the Mashaal affair , originally vowed to stay on his position .
The disclosure of the Bern operation was reportedly caused by serious inner split within Mossad due to the pending reorganization .
Senior Israeli officials issued a strong call Thursday to identify and apprehend those who released the Swiss espionage operation to local media .
Uzi Landau , Chairman of Knesset ( Parliament ) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , said this issue touched upon the national security of Israel .
He demanded those within the Mossad who was responsible be expelled immediately from the secret service .
Geodon Ezra , a lawmaker and former deputy chief of General Security Service , said great damage had been caused by the latest incident to Mossad and national security as well .
He believed that stricter scrutiny must be applied on Mossad itself to ensure national security .
In another development , Netanyahu held consultations with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss choosing the new Mossad chief .
Accepting Yatom 's resignation Tuesday , Netanyahu promised to appoint a new chief within a week .
Israel Radio reported that the head of Army 's Northern Command Amiram Levine , a personal friend of Netanyahu 's , now seems to be on the top of the list of candidates .
