& HT ; COLUMN : You 've got ta put f-u-n in vacation & HT ; By Bo Emerson & HT ; c.

We have determined that men and women define `` fun '' differently .
( See last month 's column on Viagra . ) So it stands to reason that `` vacation '' is also a disputed concept .
Not that anyone takes vacations in the '90s .
We don n't even take lunch .
Vacation is for academics and the French , people who can dally at the shore for months at a time .
Our summer is a two-week dash , jammed between camp and Scouts .
Since I spend most of my working days in a concrete box , I long for a breath of air during my brief time off .
A little walk in the woods .
But backpacking is not Maureen 's kind of leisure .
She will walk you to death in the city , but won n't seek out a waterfall .
She has worn fellow travelers to a nub hiking the canyons of Manhattan , but has yet to log significant mileage on the Appalachian Trail .
This summer we 're going to New Hampshire .
I 'm hoping that my plan for a modest , two-day jaunt in the White Mountains will tempt the wife away from the tearooms and outlet malls .
I have described the scent of juniper and balsam in the air , the eerie world above the tree line , fields of Alpine flowers .
But I know what Maureen really wants is a week at the Safety Harbor spa with her mom , aerobics every morning , a massage every afternoon and low-fat gourmet meals every night .
Come on .
Where 's the fun in that ?
Here 's a compromise : an aerobic hike up Mount Washington , an outdoor bath in a Jacuzzilike glacial stream and a nutritious Snickers bar at night .
Everybody happy ?
COLUMN : But just be sure to spell it r-e-s-t
By Maureen Downey

Summer is great if you 're a man .
Time for soda and pretzels and beer .
Time to wonder where the children went .
Here 's a clue : They went to the five different summer camps that your wife spent many woman-hours arranging .
Surveys tell us that men are assuming more responsibility for child care , but how many men know that the city recreation programs were filled to the waiting lists back in March ?
Summer , for women , is business as usual .
That 's why we don n't look for more pressure when it comes to our meager playtime .
We want less work , not more _ a little contrast with the rest of the year .
Simply , we want to increase sleep , decrease stress and squeeze in a bit of pampering .
What does Bo want ?
He wants to scale large , unfriendly rocks with a backpack full of fleece garments .
He wants to rise at 6 to a breakfast of glutinous oatmeal .
I 'm sure that he enjoys communing with nature , but I think what he really likes is shopping at REI , obsessing over boots and stitch counts and such .
I 've found that the only way to calm him down from these adventures is to remind him that Grandma Gatewood hiked the full length of the Appalachian Trail outfitted only with an apple and a pair of Keds high tops .
Walking counts as my favorite pastime , but I need greater motivation than the promise of a dry patch of ground and a handful of gorp .
Just point me in the direction of a good bakery or coffee shop , and I 'll march for miles .
