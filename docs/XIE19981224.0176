Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to Dissidents in China ( 3 )
In the early years after its founding , the United States paid no respect to human rights , and the expansion of its territory was basically accomplished by means of slaughtering , persecuting , dividing and demoralizing the native Indians .
As a result , the population of the minority nationality plunged from an original 1.8 million to fewer than 300,000 at present .
Moreover , the United States has a wartime president law , which gives the president the power to impose limits on some aspects of the people 's freedom and democratic rights when the country is in a state of war or facing other emergencies .
In line with the law , according to some recent local newspaper reports in the United States , the United States secretly detained a few dozen lawful Middle East immigrants , who were either deported or jailed for a long time .
The examples listed above shows the relativity of freedom and democracy , as well as its vulnerability to the influence of time and space .
We can also discover from these examples that only when a country enjoys a peaceful environment can its people win some freedom and democratic rights , and that a society suffering from constant wars and turbulence and frequent changes of government will bring nothing but disaster to their people .
In such a society , only a few political figures have freedom and democracy , while the common people lack even adequate food and clothing and barely survive , let alone pursue freedom and democratic rights .
