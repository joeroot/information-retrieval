Spacecraft Resumes Radio Contact With Ground
WASHINGTON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The spacecraft , known as Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous , is sending data back to scientists on Earth after a 27-hour blackout , but its mission to orbit the asteroid will be postponed , said the Washington Post Wednesday .
Currently scientists at the Johns Hopkins University are trying to determine why and how they lost radio contact with the spacecraft .
According to previous plan , the space probe will enter the asteroid 's orbit in Jan. 1999 , now the orbiting mission will be delayed until later next year or in early 2000 .
U.S. scientists said that the spacecraft is expected to fly by asteroid Eros shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday , and take a series of photographs from about 2480 miles away .
NEAR is one of the first NASA robot crafts and launched into space in 1996 .
With the spacecraft 's help , scientists want to know the chemical structure , mass and density of the asteroid so as to avoid any future possible asteroid heading with Earth .
