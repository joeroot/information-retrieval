Scientists Observe This Century 's Last Eclipse in Panama
PANAMA CITY , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Hundreds of scientists from all over the world gathered in Jaque , a city in the eastern part of Panama , to observe a total eclipse of the sun on Thursday .
The eclipse , the last in this century that will be viewed from the American continent , started at 11 : 09 and reached its maximum point at 12 : 43 local time , when the moon completely covered the sun .
Scientists from the United States , Mexico , Panama , Canada , Spain , Germany and South American countries , along with thousands of curious observers , gathered in the Panamanian community to witness the eclipse .
According to astronomer Alberto Villegas , the solar eclipse is important because it provides an opportunity to observe the outer corona of the sun .
The sun 's temperatures often reach two million degrees centigrade and can not be seen under normal conditions .
According to Panamanian experts , the next eclipse of the sun will occur in this country in 2005 .
In the past 3,000 years , nearly 5,000 solar eclipses have occurred .
The eclipse was also observable in parts of Colombia and Venezuela , as well as in some Caribbean islands .
