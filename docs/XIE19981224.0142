Experts Urge Caution When Opening Euro Accounts
BEIJING , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Chinese financial experts have urged people with foreign currency accounts to " proceed cautiously " when changing European currencies into the Euro , or opening Euro accounts .
Individuals should base related decisions on actual need in order to avoid risk , especially during the transition period , said experts of the Bank of China 's Euro Work Group ( EWG ) .
European companies based in China and Chinese foreign trade companies will be able to open Euro accounts next year to facilitate business transactions , said EWG Director Wang Bo , adding that related trade companies should proceed with care .
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency , Wang said that several European companies have opened Euro accounts with the Bank of China , with reports indicating that even more plan to do so in the near future .
" Most Chinese trade companies settle accounts with European companies in the U.S. dollar instead of European currencies , " according to Wang .
" Euro-U.S .
dollar exchanges will involve some risk if the companies decide to shift settlements to the Euro . "
Zhao Ruwei , an EWG colleague of Wang , advised Chinese holding foreign exchange to adopt a " wait and see attitude . "
" Individuals planning to study in the United States should keep their dollars , " according to Zhao .
" Those planning to invest in the foreign exchange market should diversify their currencies in order to avoid risk . "
An constantly increasing number of Chinese citizens have opened foreign currency accounts over the past decade , with some voicing concern about what to do with foreign money following the January 1 launch of the Euro .
