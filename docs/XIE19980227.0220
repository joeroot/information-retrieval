Guangzhou Real Estate Brisk
GUANGZHOU , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The market for commodity housing in this capital city of south China 's Guangdong Province has taken a favorable turn recently .
However , office space is not selling well , according to city officials .
Statistics show that 27.9 billion yuan-worth of commodity housing , totaling 3.59 million sq m , were sold in 1997 , respectively up 64.7 percent and 77 percent over 1996 .
Deals on office buildings involved 233,000 sq m , down 5.48 percent from the previous year .
Experts attribute the increasing purchasing capacity to the rapid growth of residents ' annual incomes .
Cuts in interest rates by banks have also triggered residents ' desire in apartment purchasing .
The Guangzhou branch of the China Construction Bank said it has made efforts to increase housing loans from 710 million yuan in 1996 to three billion yuan last year .
