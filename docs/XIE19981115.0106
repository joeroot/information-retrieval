Israel Closes Down Al-Hakawati Theater in East
JERUSALEM , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Israeli authority issued an order Sunday morning , closing down the Palestinian Al-Hakawati Theater in East Jerusalem .
The order was issued after receiving the news that the Fatah Movement of Palestine was scheduled to convene a conference at the theater Sunday morning to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Tunis declaration of an independent Palestinian state .
After the theater 's closing down , members of the Fatah , the main stream of Palestinian political faction set up by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , and other Palestinians were forced to move to the Orient House in East Jerusalem .
Israeli security forces have surrounded the theater and the Orient House , which is in fact a representative office of the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) in East Jerusalem .
The Palestinians started the tenth anniversary celebrations in various cities of Gaza and the West Bank on Saturday .
Addressing a mass rally attended by thousands on Saturday in Nablus , Arafat reaffirmed that he will declare an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital next May , when the five-year transitional period of the Oslo Accord expires .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cautioned that if the Palestinians declare statehood , Israel reserves the right to stop the process and annex those parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip still under its control .
In response to Arafat 's Saturday speech , Netanyahu 's communication advisor David Bar-Illan reiterated that Israel 's position that such a unilateral declaration would be not just a violation of the Oslo Accord , but its cancellation .
Under the Oslo Accord signed in 1993 , the final-status talks between the Palestinians and Israel should be concluded as the five-year transitional period expires next May .
But in reality , such talks , which will solve the issues as refugees , border and the status of Jerusalem , have not started yet .
Arafat declared Palestine 's independence 10 years ago in Tunis , which has been recognized by many countries of the world .
