ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines may buy a minority stake in Brazilian partner Transbrasil , which needs fresh capital amid fare wars that followed deregulation of the country 's airline industry .
A Transbrasil official told Blooomberg News the carrier is negotiating to sell up to 20 percent of its voting shares .
`` We 'd get fresh investment and technology , while Delta would get a partner in Brazil , '' said Jorge Honorio , a Transbrasil spokesman in Brazil .
Atlanta-based Delta , which earlier this year bought a 35 percent stake in AeroPeru , declined comment on any negotiations .
But a spokesman acknowledged a continued relationship with Transbrasil is important for Delta 's year-old service to Brazil .
`` The partnership with Transbrasil and the Brazil service have been very successful , '' said spokesman Bill Berry .
Under their current relationship , which doesn n't include any investment by Delta , the two carriers sell seats on each other 's flights .
That means Delta can book passengers not just between Atlanta and Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , the two cities where its jets fly , but also to Transbrasil 's destinations within Brazil .
Transbrasil , likewise , can book passengers on Delta 's U.S. flights .
Delta earlier had a similar deal with Varig , a larger Brazilian carrier , but Varig called off the partnership last year .
Marketing pacts with in-country carriers is a key to Delta 's Latin expansion plans , as well as those of other U.S. carriers .
Equity purchases by U.S. carriers reflect the value they put on the deals .
For instance , AeroPeru also needed capital and was able to make itself the object of a bidding war between Delta and Continental Airlines .
Delta starts Peru service this summer .
Delta also has a partnership with Aeropostal of Venezuela , where it started service in April , but that deal does not include any investment .
Delta has numerous code-share deals with carriers in Europe , but its only financial investment is a 5 percent equity stake in Swissair .
