AN OLDER WORLD EXISTS UNDER FAST-GROWING ARIZONA COUNTY
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By LYNDA GOROV c.1998 The Boston Globe
MESA , Ariz. _ On the surface , the intersection looks like any other in Maricopa County : service station , shopping plaza , a vacant lot prime for development .
Beneath the pizza parlor and gas pumps is another world altogether , one that disappeared half a millennium ago but that still speaks to archeologists in central and southern Arizona .
They happened upon this particular piece of it when the city decided to widen the road , and backhoes turned up yet another village of the prehistoric people known as the Hohokam .
But with Maricopa County growing faster than any other in the country , archeologists fear that Hohokam sites are disappearing daily , before they even have a chance to record their existence .
Concern about sprawl is so great that a volunteer group formed a sort of 911 service _ the South West Archeology Team , or SWAT _ to handle emergency surveys and excavations when a site is threatened .
`` Developers see us as the kiss of death , '' said Jerry Howard , curator of archeology at the Mesa Southwest Museum .
`` They think we 're going to interfere with construction , maybe stop the project , cost them a lot of money .
...
But we can get in and look at the site before the construction crews even get there . ''
Still , with the entire city of Phoenix and much of the surrounding area built on the ancient civilization 's ruins , the tensions between archeology buffs and developers are apparent .
Each new golf course or luxury condominium sits atop a potential site of the Hohokam , expert farmers who lived from about 300 BC to AD 1450 and whose disappearance has spawned various theories .
At one proposed housing development in the town of Cave Creek north of Phoenix , hand-lettered signs read `` Preserve Spur Cross , '' as it is known .
The archeological grapevine buzzes about petroglyphs , pit-houses , and the Hohokam equivalent of apartment complexes .
Planning commission meetings around the county are packed with amateur archeologists who say too much history has been lost already .
`` In another decade , it 'll be too late , '' said Glen Rice , an archeologist at Arizona State University .
`` We don n't need to excavate every site .
We could put them aside for the future , when our techniques are much better .
In the meantime , we 're losing our ability to study them at all . ''
Added James Britton , chairman of the SWAT team , `` We have to do what we can while we have the chance , before it all gets bulldozed over . ''
For now , archeologists say , they must rely on the largesse of developers , who are under no legal obligation to safeguard archeological sites on private land unless their construction projects involve federal money or permits .
Under state law , only burial sites must be reported , and the remains handed over .
Otherwise , each municipality has its own rules ; the county encourages preservation but has no corresponding ordinance , said Joy Rich , acting director of planning and development .
Keith Nath , Mesa 's engineering and construction director , conceded that the city does no archeological surveys unless it is aware that ruins are in the area .
If only local money is involved , such as with the road widening , no survey is required .
Locals , however , did persuade Mesa to buy a major platform mound , believed to be a religious site .
`` Public land is iffy ; it 's a farce on private land , '' Grace Schoonover , a Phoenix native and amateur archeologist whose Cave Creek home office is filled with survey maps and artists ' renderings of the intricate web of canals dug by the Hohokam .
`` Anyone who finds burials , they 're supposed to stop immediately and report them .
That doesn n't mean they always do it . ''
Developers who do right by archeological ruins are what Schoonover calls `` the good guys , '' and there are plenty of them even in the 9,238 square miles that make up Maricopa County , whose population grew more than 27 percent to 2.7 million from 1990 to 1997 , according to the US Census Bureau .
Some developers , such as Jerry and Florence Nelson , have sponsored excavations and even donated ruin-rich land to the Archeological Conservancy , a nonprofit group based in Albuquerque .
Today , the conservancy has 14 sites in Arizona , but just one in the Phoenix area _ the Hohokam village on 2 acres in the midst of the posh Scottsdale subdivision that the Nelsons built .
`` What we try to do is show developers that there is usually a way to preserve the archeological resources and still allow development , '' said James Walker , southwest regional director of the conservancy , which preserves but does not necessarily excavate the sites .
`` As a result , many of our preserves are in the middle of subdivisions . ''
Archeologists say they are not trying to stop development , and that they too understand the need for more housing and stores to serve the burgeoning population .
`` Whenever we 're sitting around complaining , I always say , ` Yeah , they should 've stopped building right after they built my house , '' ' said Vicky Erhart , an amateur archeologist and SWAT team member .
`` We 're all living on top of it . ''
No one _ not the cities , not the state , not the developers _ has enough money to excavate the hundreds , maybe even thousands , of sites in Maricopa County alone .
Instead , the aim is to record what information can be obtained before the next minimall is built .
In the Phoenix area , about 15 companies provide that service , handling the archeology angle for clients in the public and private sectors .
Archeology Research Services , for instance , works on about 120 projects year , most of them surveying , some of them involving data testing and recovery , said projects manager Serelle Laine .
A recent survey for the city of Tempe uncovered three sensitive acres , which turned out to be Hohokam hearths and roasting pits , among other discoveries .
`` We 've had instances where the developer started out planning on meeting the minimum requirements .
But if you get a really cool site , they get into it , '' Laine said .
`` Generally , though , they 're not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts .
It depends on the hooks , the permits , or land jurisdiction . ''
Not surprisingly , amateur and professional archeologists alike want stricter regulations regarding Hohokam ruins , many of them long since plowed underground , but some of them still visible at surface level .
As a model , they cite Pima County , which includes Tucson and requires developers to find ways to lessen the impact on archeological sites .
Many would also force adherence by even single-house developers .
Ever since Frank Casanova began developing his six acres outside Phoenix almost two decades ago , he and his friends at the state archeological society have been digging in his back yard .
So far , they have uncovered four blocks of rooms and the remains of three infants , complete with tiny jars , in the burial grounds .
`` How could someone not be interested in this ? ''
he said .
Richard Mueller , an artist and electrical supplies salesman , wasn n't initially interested in the possibility of ruins on his new Cave Creek property .
Then a friend who is an amateur archeologist insisted on walking the property .
After stepping two feet , she told him it was packed with pottery shards , digging tools , and other Hohokam artifacts .
So Mueller called Schoonover , and she recently presented him with a map detailing dozens of spots that should be investigated before the groundbreaking in June .
`` It probably wouldn n't have occurred to me , but now I can see things all over the place , '' said Mueller , an avid arrowhead collector who has since joined the archeological society .
`` Hopefully , we can salvage as much as possible , and I can still build on time .
But I don n't think anymore that you should plow something under without first seeing what 's there . ''
