MARKET ADVANCES BROADLY ON SURGING TECH STOCKS , OVERSEAS RALLIES
( See also ECON-REPORT ) ( JT ) By SHARON R. KING c.1998 N.Y .

NEW YORK _ Led by a surge in technology shares , rallies overseas and investor relief over a reprieve in the Monica Lewinsky scandal , U.S. stocks rose for a second day Tuesday and helped the major indexes erase most of the wrenching declines suffered over the previous two weeks .
Although the market remains substantially below the highs reached a month ago , analysts said investors apparently were heeding reports pointing out how a wide array of stocks had fallen to relatively cheap levels .
The buying spree lifted the Dow Jones industrial average 139.80 points , a 1.6 percent gain , to 8 , 714.65 , after a 1.8 percent gain Monday .
American Express , Sears , Roebuck , International Business Machines , Hewlett-Packard and Aluminum Co. of America each added more than 10 points to the blue chip gauge , as 16 of Dow 's 30 stocks ended higher .
The Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500-company index rose 17.53 points , to 1 , 101.20 , also a 1.6 percent increase .
Microsoft , General Electric and Pfizer led the advance .
Led by strong gains among such bellwether technology issues as Microsoft , Intel , Cisco and Dell , the Nasdaq composite index fared better .
The key technology barometer rose 37.06 points , a 2 percent gain .
Investors also felt more confident buying shares because political uncertainty surrounding President Clinton had eased considerably after he admitted during grand jury testimony on Monday to having an `` inappropriate '' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky , a former White House intern .
In addition , the market 's nervousness was soothed by Russia 's devaluation of its currency on Monday , ending speculation about what steps that country would take to avert an economic collapse .
Stock markets in Europe were strongly higher , reflecting investor optimism that Russia had taken decisive action , and the momentum from those gains were felt on Wall Street when trading began .
Germany 's benchmark equity index rose 3.1 percent to its highest level in four months .
Stocks gained more than 3 percent on London , Amsterdam , and Paris exchanges .
In Japan , stocks rose nearly 2 percent , erasing most of Monday 's loss .
`` Prices have reached attractive levels and cash has built up and all of that conspired to get us to buy stocks , '' said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
In addition , he said , `` the stage of being very alarmed about Russia and Asia may be behind us . ''
Investors ' renewed confidence in the market also helped smaller company shares erase nearly all of last week 's declines .
The Russell 2,000 index of smaller company stocks rose 7.33 points , to 411.29 points , a 1.8 percent gain .
Shares of Skytel Communications , the Russell 's leading gainer , rose 5 points to 18 5 / 8 after the company announced that AT&AMP ; T will sell its nationwide paging services .
The buying Tuesday was more broad-based than the previous session , when the gains were largely confined to big stocks .
On Monday investors `` stuck their toe in the water , '' said Richard Cripps , chief market strategist at Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore .
But Tuesday , he said , ` ' they were more willing to go into small and mid-cap names . ''
He pointed to shares of United Rentals , a small equipment leasing firm .
This week , both Legg Mason and Salomon Smith Barney recommended the stock to investors , pointing out that it had fallen almost 40 percent from its high of $ 48 on July 20 .
Tuesday , United Rentals closed at 32 7 / 8 , up 3 7 / 8.
Prior to Tuesday , individual investors showed little interest in those shares , he said .
Overall , technology shares , financial services companies , telecommunications companies and drug stocks were among the leading gainers .
On the New York Stock Exchange advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1.
Despite these gains , analysts remained cautious in their outlook and and said investors were primarily seeking out shares of companies that appear to have a relatively clear picture of future earnings .
Another sign of investors ' defensive stance was a strong flow of cash into large company stock funds , particularly index funds , said AMG Data Services , a California research firm that tracks mutual fund trends .
Robert Adler , president of AMG , said these funds accounted for the bulk of the $ 1.5 billion that flowed into equity mutual funds , more than three times as much as in the previous week , AMG said .
Robert Adler , AMG Data 's president .
said the bulk of the cash went into large stock growth and income funds , including index funds .
First Albany 's Johnson said his recent buying was limited to shares of Pepsi-Cola as he continued to hold a large number of consumer staple stocks , which he believes will provide dependable earnings regardless of market conditions .
His holdings include drug stocks such as Merck , consumer products companies like Procter & AMP ; Gamble and food companies like Sara Lee .
He also likes larger technology companies such as Dell , IBM and Compaq .
