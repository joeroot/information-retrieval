1998 Cox News Service
Even in a season ripe with Civil War fiction , regular readers of Kaye Gibbons may be surprised that the North Carolina writer 's newest novel has taken a turn toward the historical .
Gibbons , more noted for her contemporary family stories , has just published `` On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon '' ( Putnam , $ 22.95 ) , which begins in 1842 with protagonist Emma Garnet chronicling her life at Seven Oaks , her father 's Virginia plantation .
Emma 's father is a tyrant who verbally abuses his wife and six children .
He treats the servants even worse , except for Clarice , a strong woman who opens Emma 's eyes to the brutality of slavery .
Emma escapes by marrying a Northern doctor , Dr. Quincy Lowell , and moving to Raleigh .
But what begins as a harmonious life is soon shattered by the war .
`` The Civil War presents a bottomless bounty , '' Gibbons says .
`` I 've always been interested in crucibles of history and I love research .
So for a year and a half I sat on the sun porch of the house and read and took notes . ''
Gibbons ' interest in the Civil War was partly responsible for the publication of `` Cold Mountain , '' Charles Frazier 's best-selling 1997 novel .
She met Frazier in 1988 and learned he was working on a book .
When Frazier 's wife took her the manuscript several years later , Gibbons says , she called her agent about the book and said `` ` This is going to be an extraordinary event .
Fasten your seat belts . '' ' She was right .
Frazier 's romantic odyssey about a Civil War deserter has been on best-seller lists for nearly a year .
It took Gibbons three years to write her newest novel , and the project presented special challenges .
Last December , Oprah Winfrey chose two of Gibbons ' novels for her television book club and thrust the writer into the national spotlight .
As `` Ellen Foster '' ( Vintage , $ 10 ) and `` A Virtuous Woman '' ( Vintage , $ 10 ) soared up best-seller lists after her TV appearance , Gibbons , 38 , found that fame came with a price .
`` The Oprah selection was a blessing , '' says Gibbons , but it brought a barrage of mail and calls .
One day the phone rang 65 times , she says .
And Gibbons was having problems with `` On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon . ''
In January , she threw out 900 pages and started rewriting , determined to meet the publisher 's deadline on schedule this week .
`` I felt pressure , not from the publisher , but from myself to get it out as close to the Oprah hoopla as possible , '' Gibbons says .
`` I had a book but it wasn n't a story .
The research had taken over .
I would write a chapter just to get in an interesting detail .
It was boring , flat . ''
Faith Sale , her editor at Putnam , agreed .
`` When I saw it , I said , ` I don n't think this is what you want to be doing . ' Every page was valuable because she was learning how to integrate the details of the period , but she hadn n't put any real live characters in it .
They were there , but they weren n't feeling anything . ''
For the next 10 weeks , Gibbons rewrote the entire book , beginning each evening and working through the night .
`` In the book , Emma Garnet talks about livable chaos , '' Gibbons says .
`` I got that directly from my life in those months . ''
Nearly all of Gibbons ' research was from primary sources such as diaries , letters and vanity press books published by women after the war .
`` I stayed away from the revisionist , politically correct books , '' she says .
`` I didn n't want my history regurgitated . ''
Gibbons says she was amazed at the resourcefulness and toughness of the women in the 19th century .
`` I knew about the high rate of infant mortality , but when I started reading women 's journals , I was devastated by the constant loss that these women felt .
I don n't think women now are capable of doing what women had to do back then .
I sit in my kitchen and I look at my microwave and my stainless-steel coffee warmer .
We live on easy street . ''
When her national book tour is over in July , Gibbons wants to write a biography of her mother , a manic-depressive who committed suicide .
Gibbons touched on her mother 's death in `` Ellen Foster , '' her critically acclaimed 1987 debut novel based on her traumatic childhood .
Growing up in poverty in a four-room frame house in Rocky Mount , N.C . , Gibbons was orphaned at 10 .
Diagnosed with manic-depression , Gibbons at one time was taking 27 pills a day to control her mood swings .
But `` Ellen Foster '' did not delve very deeply into her mother 's life , Gibbons says .
`` That 's why I 'm interviewing relatives and going over her medical records .
I want to piece together her life because I want to know my mother as a woman .
It 's become an obsession .
In the summers my mother always wore wide-brimmed straw hats .
A girl should know that about her mother . ''
After finishing the book , she plans to take some time off .
`` I want to be Martha Stewart , '' says Gibbons , who lives in Raleigh with her husband , Frank Ward , and her three daughters from a previous marriage .
`` I want to be a housewife .
One who reads a lot , takes naps in the afternoon .
I want to clean out my underwear drawer .
Little things like that that I haven n't been able to do .
I have probably 100 pairs of socks with no mates .
I want to fix my socks . ''
