Indonesia National Front Said to Support Demonstrators
JAKARTA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Indonesian National Front opposition group leader Lt. Gen. ( ret ) Kemal Idris admitted that he had been behind the anti-government demonstrators , the Indonesian Observer reported Sunday .
In an interview with the privately owned television network on Saturday , Kemal Idris , a former chief of Army Paratroops , said he was ready to be arrested .
The National Front , launched on August 6 to provide opposition to the government , placed the blame for the present condition of the country squarely at the feet of the current administration under President B.J. Habibie .
The National Front wanted the People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) to hold a plenary meeting no later than November this year to oust the present government and form a national presidium to run the nation until next year 's general election .
Meanwhile , mobs rioted in Jakarta as anger against the military 's treatment of student protesters in the past week boiled over into riots in which shops were looted and buildings were torched .
A mob of thousands rioted in the Central Jakarta district of Senen , looting shops and shattering shop-front windows along a crowded main street .
At least two vehicles were set alight .
In the northern Chinatown district , which bore the brunt of savage riots in May , a car dealership was set on fire and two trucks inside were wrecked .
On the street outside , two overturned cars were torched and two nearby buildings were also gutted by fire .
In East Jakarta , police fired teargas and rubber bullets at a mob which attacked a police station .
Cosmas Batubara , a former minister , quoted the Armed Forces Chief as saying there were two groups within the protesters , one of students , the other is an unknown third force wearing student jackets .
Jakarta Military Commander Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman has urged the city 's 11 million residents to stay in their homes after 10 p.m. for the next few nights .
There have also been reports of student-led protests in cities of Surabaya ( East Java province ) and Bandung ( West Java province ) .
In the north Sumatran city of Medan , about 5,000 students occupied the airport and demanded they be taken to Jakarta to join anti-government protests .
Security forces persuaded them to leave without violence .
Students have been at the forefront of protests the whole week , demanding that the MPR , the highest legislative body , institute deeper political reform .
The MPR , which ended a special four-day session on Friday night , went some way to meeting student demands though it maintained its commitment to a military role in politics .
The situation in the Indonesian capital remains unclear though the military now seems to be in control of most areas of the city , the Indonesian Observer said .
