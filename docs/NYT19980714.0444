STADIUM PROPONENTS MUST REACH FOR THE STARS
( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By KEVIN MODESTI c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES _ The proponents of modernizing the Coliseum got it all wrong .
They figured the NFL will choose the owners and site of Los Angeles ' next pro football team based on serious factors like financing , location and which stadium model looks the least like it was built by a 14-year-old hopped up on glue .
Having a fancy scale model to plop down on the presentation table is so important that Hollywood Park executives , who want to put a stadium in the racetrack parking lot , paid $ 35,000 for theirs .
For $ 35,000 it should have come with a fully functional blimp .
Speaking of which , one reason Hollywood Park apparently has dropped off the A-list of possible stadium sites is the proximity of LAX would make it impossible to fly a blimp there .
As we said , serious factors .
But now the money men behind the so-called New Coliseum understand there 's more to impressing the NFL than all that .
This being Los Angeles , they 've come to realize there are certain expectations that don n't apply to other would-be NFL cities .
Put another way , if the league wanted a succession of gray suits with ledger sheets under their arms , they could spend all their time in Houston .
Here , they want glitz .
Here , they want stars .
The New Coliseum people caught on after Michael Ovitz , the Hollywood deal maker who wants to build a stadium on a former dump site in Carson , suggested the team owners might include Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner .
All over the NFL , from the Park Avenue headquarters to Green Bay , men of substance perked up like schoolgirls at a Hanson concert .
The New Coliseum people happen to find it absurd , the thought that even a multi-millionaire actor could play much of a financial role in a project with a price tag in the high nine figures .
But they seem to have gotten the message : The future of L.A .
football might belong to whoever gets the biggest star to attach his or her name to the venture .
`` That 's probably one of the things that make the NFL angry at us , '' said John Semcken III , executive vice president of the New Coliseum partners , who include Kings owners Ed Roski Jr. and Philip Anschutz .
`` We 're just boring old real-estate guys ....
We 've got to get a few more of those ( celebrities ) to get on board . ''
Semcken said this over crab cakes at a Westwood bistro .
Maybe he hoped to find a star there .
If the competition for a franchise were a football game , this would be the long TV timeout before the fourth quarter .
Cleveland has been awarded a team _ the new Browns _ for 1999 .
Los Angeles is in the running for 2001 , against , reportedly , Houston , Toronto and even Mexico City .
The NFL not only hasn n't decided among the candidate cities , it hasn n't even decided among the possible L.A .
sites .
The league figures it will benefit from the dragged-out competition .
The NFL not only hasn n't set a timetable for deciding , it hasn n't even set a timetable for setting a timetable .
But something could break at the league meetings in October or next spring , after stadium referendums in Denver and several other cities determine if franchises will move .
The New Coliseum people say their proposal will be ready for presentation when the NFL gets serious .
At this point , the only problem is a $ 61 million gap in the financing , but guys like this can scrape that much together from between the sofa cushions .
Semcken is convinced the New Coliseum should and will be the home of our next NFL team .
The plan is to construct a multi-deck stadium within the existing , 75-year-old walls as part of a proposal to make Exposition Park a year-round entertainment destination .
`` ( The Coliseum ) and the Hollywood sign are probably the two most recognized structures in Los Angeles , '' Semcken said .
There 's Hollywood again .
Now , these aren n't exactly stuffed shirts , the New Coliseumites .
Roski just got back from climbing K2 , or three-quarters of it , anyway .
Semcken is a former fighter pilot who advised the makers of `` Top Gun . ''
He even appeared in a bar scene .
But sharing the screen with Tom Cruise might not constitute sufficient star quality for the NFL .
Whoever eventually puts the `` style '' in `` peristyle '' must be `` a unique individual , '' Semcken said .
`` They 're going to have to be interested in doing something for the community . ''
And convinced they 're joining the winning team .
`` A person in that position doesn n't want to be associated with a project that doesn n't get done , '' Semcken said .
Recently , Keyshawn Johnson , the New York Jets receiver from USC , signed on as a spokesman for the New Coliseum and Exposition Park revitalization .
An NFL star _ that 's a step in the right direction .
Disney chairman Michael Eisner has endorsed the plan .
An entertainment mogul _ even better .
Magic Johnson was interested but the price for his support , a stake in the franchise , was too high .
Just as well .
Nobody would connect Magic with show business .
Needed : a real , high-magnitude star with some mad money and a love for football .
How about Leonardo DiCaprio ?
He needs a new team , after he became the Lakers ' second-most visible fan and they turned into the second-biggest shipwreck of the spring .
Jim Carrey ?
Truman , his entire life manipulated for the benefit of television , would fit right in with the NFL .
Of course , the ( begin ital ) ideal ( end ital ) would be an NFL superstar with L.A .
roots who is also an actor .
Unfortunately , the only man for the job is busy these days hunting for the real killers .
