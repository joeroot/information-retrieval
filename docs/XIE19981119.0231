4 Out of 10 Youths Have Mental Illness in NZ : Report
WELLINGTON , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Nearly half of New Zealand 's young people may be suffering from a mental illness , the New Zealand Press Association ( NZPA ) reported Thursday .
It said that a Christchurch health and development study examined the prevalence and treatment of psychiatric disorders in more than 1,000 Christchurch-born 18-year-old youths and found more than 40 percent of them showed signs of having at least one mental illness , though they had not necessarily received a clinical diagnosis .
Their problems ranged from mood disorders including depression to anxiety disorders such as panic disorders and agoraphobia , conduct disorder , and substance abuse including alcohol abuse or dependence , cannabis abuse or dependence , and other substance abuse or dependence excluding nicotine dependence .
NZPA quoted study executive director Professor David Fergusson as saying that these young people had four main types of problems : substance abuse ( 24 percent ) , mood disorders ( 22 percent ) , anxiety disorders ( 17 percent ) , and conduct disorders ( five percent ) .
Of those showing signs of mental health problems , 42 percent showed signs of having more than one psychiatric disorder .
According to the study , rates of disorder were similar overall for males and females , but mood and anxiety disorders were more common among young women while conduct disorders and substance abuse were more common among young men .
Fergusson said data was gathered during interviews with the young people and their families , and it was possible that the figures were an exaggeration of reality .
" Even so , the study shows that symptoms of mental illness are alarmingly common among youths , " he said .
The professor urged the New Zealand Health Ministry to improve both state and community mental health services for young people .
