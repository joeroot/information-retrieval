Hyundai to Fix 46,000 Cars Sold in Australia
CANBERRA , November 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Hyundai Automotive Australia , a company set up by South Korean car giant Hyundai , announced Thursday that it will conduct a customer service campaign in Australia to address safety concerns with up to 46,000 of its Excel passenger cars .
Without referring to the move as a formal recall , Hyundai said in the southern Australian port city of Adelaide that the Australian Federal Office of Road Safety ( FORS ) had approved a plan to inspect and strengthen all Excels sold in Australia that were built in South Korea between August 1994 and March 1996 .
It said the exercise would involve the use of stainless steel rivets to strengthen parts of the sub-frame of the cars which could be the subject of cracking because of faulty welds .
The procedure would be carried out at no cost to car owners and followed a detailed examination of the issue by FORS .
Safety concerns with the Excel were raised last week by the Australian Automobile Association ( AAA ) , which said the suspect welds could affect the right front wheel .
Hyundai admitted 46 Excels had been repaired and another 178 fitted with preventive modifications .
But it refused to order a general recall , instead setting up a hotline for concerned owners to ring and also promising to fix any cars found to have problems .
The AAA and the Australian Consumers Association called on Hyundai to recall the cars , while Australian Federal Transport Minister John Anderson gave the company a week to prove it had adequately dealt with the safety issue .
Doug Croker , managing director of Hyundai Automotive Australia , said the company believed the action was appropriate to reassure the customers about the long-term integrity of the sub-frame and to further put their minds at ease that Hyundai would guarantee the strengthened area for life .
