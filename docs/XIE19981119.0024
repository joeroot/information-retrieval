Zimbabwean Bank Forecasts 2.5 Percent GDP Growth
HARARE , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- One of Zimbabwe 's leading commercial banks , Standard Chartered , has forecast a 2.5 percent real GDP growth for 1999 , with a considerable downside risk .
In its November issue of Business Trends magazine released Wednesday in Harare , the bank said the country 's inflation needed to slow during the year , averaging about 27.5 percent and falling below 20 percent by the end of 1999 .
" GDP growth will depend hugely on global economic development , commodity prices , regional conditions and climatic factors , " the bank said .
" Given the enormous uncertainties surrounding all these factors , predictions are hazardous .
We are forecasting 2.5 percent real GDP growth though with considerable downside risk , " it said .
Zimbabwe 's year on year inflation stands at 31.7 percent and is expected to hit 32 percent by the end of the year .
Over the next three years to 2002 , economic conditions were likely to be substantially influenced by the changed socio-political climate , especially the demand for " catch-up " in respect of wages and living standards particularly by low income groups .
The pressures to which the government was being forced to respond would be exacerbated by political uncertainties in the form of parliamentary elections ( 2000 ) and presidential elections in 2002 , the bank said .
