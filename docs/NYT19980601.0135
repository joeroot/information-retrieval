Much is written about the struggles of working women balancing work and family .
But what about the working dad ?
In the 1990s , more and more fathers want to play a significant role in rearing their children , but the workplace is not always so accommodating .
Levine and Pittinsky describe how a father 's work affects his family and vice versa , and offer suggestions on how to achieve a better balance .

As many women have children later in life and divorced men remarry and have second families , many men in theIR late 40s , 50s and 60s are finding themselves the fathers of newborns .
They may get mistaken for grandfathers , but this new breed of fathers brings a fresh new perspective to fatherhood , the authors say , often valuing their children as much or even more than work .
But older fathers also face doubts about whether it 's fair to raise a young child at an advanced age .

This Father 's Day , Herrera 's children have asked him to take them to see `` Godzilla . ''
The request evokes memories of his own childhood , when he and his dad would go to the movies on Father 's Day , a rare time for them to be together , just the two of them .
`` The time a child spends alone with his or her father is special .
Too often it 's taken for granted by both parent and child , '' Herrera says .
