Arms Inspections Proceed Smoothly in Iraq
BAGHDAD , November 21 ( Xinhua ) -- U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq proceeded smoothly for the fourth consecutive day Saturday with full cooperation from the Iraqi side , said an Iraqi official .
Hussam Mohammed Ameen , director-general of Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate which provide escorts for U.N. arms inspectors , was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying a missle team made a surprise visit to a military enterprise .
However , sources close to U.N. arms inspectors told Xinhua that the missile team just conducted routine monitoring activities to a military project that had been checked several times before .
The sources said incidents might come up when intrusive inspections are conducted to new suspected sites in the following days .
A chemical team of the U.N. Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , which oversees disarmament in Iraq , visited a weapon site to check tagged equipment there , said Ameen , adding a biological team also visited a site , where they maintained surveilance cameras and checked tagged equipment .
Four groups of the Interational Atomic Energy Agency in charge of Iraq 's nuclear program inspected some Iraqi buildings where they took some samples of leaves .
Ameen also said that the American U-2 reconnaissance plane on Saturday violated the Iraqi air space and reconnoitered some locations .
Iraq has criticized chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler , who on Wednesday accused Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of concealing information from arms teams .
Iraq said the U.N. teams has conducted long searches of many of Iraqi government archives but found nothing contrary to its declarations .
Butler 's requests for handing out Iraq 's secret documents of biological and chemical program " seemed to be provocative rather than professional , " Iraqi officials said .
The U.N. arms inspection in Iraq was resumed Wednesday , one day after the inspectors returned from Bahrain , where they had relocated last week amid fears of air strikes .
Last Saturday , as Washington prepared to launch air strikes against Iraq , Baghdad announced it would resume full and unconditional cooperation with the inspectors .
