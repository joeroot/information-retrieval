India Terms U.S. Action " Counter-Productive "
NEW DELHI , November 14 ( Xinhua ) -- India termed on Saturday as " coercive and counter-productive " U.S. barring of over 200 Indian companies from having any kind of business or trade relations with the United States .
" We regard this as a highly unfortunate development , " a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs said here .
The Clinton Administration on Friday formally identified 40 Indian entities along with their 200 subsidiaries which will be barred from having any business link with American companies .
The Nuclear Power Corporation of India , Bharat Earth Movers Limited , Indian Space Research Organization , Bhabha Atomic Research Center and the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research , suspected to be involved in nuclear missile and military programs , are among the Indian companies blacklisted by the U.S.
The restriction interfered with the free flow of trade , technology and finance and would have an adverse impact on mutually beneficial business interaction , the Indian spokesman said .
Washington 's decision reflected the continuation of a coercive approach that is entirely misplaced and counter-productive , he said , adding that such steps were unhelpful for meaningful discussions towards an improvement in the bilateral relations between the two countries .
The U.S. decision came barely a week before the scheduled crucial talks on nuclear issues and non-proliferation between U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Indian prime minister 's special envoy Jaswant Singh in Rome next Thursday .
