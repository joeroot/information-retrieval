HIGH-PROTEIN , NO-SUGAR DIET IS TRENDY , BUT WON ' T KEEP THE WEIGHT OFF
( EDS : Accompanied by DIET-CHART ) ( For use by NYTimes News Service clients ) By CAROLYN POIROT c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
The people of New Orleans love to eat .
And now the people of New Orleans love to diet .
The Sugar Busters diet is all the rage in the city of etouffee and remoulade , where a survey recently concluded that a third of the people are overweight .
Now in bookstores nationwide , the Sugar Busters diet _ high on protein , low on carbohydrates _ was designed by a vascular surgeon , two gastroenterologists and an oilman in New Orleans .
They say their self-published book sold more than 200,000 copies its first month .
Some of the best restaurants in New Orleans , including Commander 's Palace , now serve Sugar Busters specials _ such as a large pork chop on a small mountain of sweet potatoes pureed with spicy sausage and nestled on a lake of spinach , sauteed with bacon .
What 's not on the Sugar Busters menu are sweets , including the sugars in such dietary superstars as carrots , rice and pasta .
Sugar Busters is only the latest in a line of trendy high-protein / low-carb diets , with names like Protein Power and The Zone .
All are simply variations on the Atkins diet , launched in the early '70s by Dr. Robert Atkins .
And guess what ?
Such diets are high in fat and , over the long haul , hard on the kidneys and liver , according to dietitians .
They may result in short-term weight loss , but they 'll always leave you feeling hungry .
The American Dietetic Association analyzed recipes in the `` Sugar Busters ! ''
book and found that the calories from fat ranged from 41 percent to 85 percent .
( The healthy recommended level is 30 percent or less . ) Total calories ranged up to 1,172 for a single serving of Emeril 's pan roasted filet mignon . ''
The Atkins diet was launched in 1972 with the publication of `` Dr. Atkins ' Diet Revolution . ''
Atkins is still specializing in diet and nutrition as medical director of The Atkins Center for Complimentary Medicine in New York City .
He has written a revised edition of his original book , which sold 10 million copies , and last month published `` The Vita-Nutrient Solution : Nature 's Answer to Drugs '' ( Simon & AMP ; Schuster , $ 24 ) .
The promise of low-carbohydrate diets zeros in on the fact that the body first uses carbohydrates ( sugars and starches ) for its basic energy needs , because they are quickly and easily turned into the glucose needed to sustain life .
If the body doesn n't immediately need the glucose , it is stored as fat until blood-sugar levels get low and it is needed .
The theory is , if the body doesn n't have carbohydrates immediately available , it will turn to the stored fat as its source of energy .
`` The Atkins diet has been revived , '' said Barbara Gollman , a Dallas dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association .
`` It works , at least short term , but the reason it works is because it is calorie-controlled . ''
The problem , Gollman says , is that you can n't stay healthy on this diet for the long haul because it has too much protein and not enough vitamins , minerals and other nutrients .
`` It 's too much protein for your body to handle .
Ultimately the kidneys will be stressed by all that protein , '' she said .
The immediate weight loss on a high-protein diet is water loss , said Dr. Margo Denke of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at Dallas .
When protein is broken down , it releases nitrogen , which must be washed out of the body quickly .
Water from tissue cells comes to the rescue , reducing overall water weight .
`` Evidence accumulated in the 1970s documents the fact that if you restrict carbohydrates and increase protein , you promote the loss of body water and salt , '' Denke said .
`` Remember , the biggest component of our bodies is water , so if you lose extra salt and water , you lose weight .
You don n't lose fat , but you do lose weight . ''
She warns that high-protein / low-carbohydrate diets can give a false sense of security the first week or 10 days , when you are likely to lose 5 pounds or more .
`` Like most diet tricks , it works for a while , '' Denke said .
`` It bespeaks how desperate we are .
To restrict carrots because they contain some sugar is just craziness . ''
In people with diabetes or kidney damage , such diets can cause renal failure , she added .
And high-protein diets are almost invariably high in fat .
Most major sources of protein _ such as steak , bacon , cheese and eggs _ are also high in fat and cholesterol , which can lead to heart disease , stroke and some forms of cancer , according to Elisabeth Anderson , outpatient nutrition counselor at Harris Methodist Fort Worth .
`` These are diets that have been around on and off for a long time , '' Anderson said .
`` They are low in calories , very restrictive and monotonous , for the most part .
And they are low in calcium and vitamins so they can n't be good for long . ''
They are also low in volume , so you don n't feel full for long .
