IN PYLA , GREEK CYPRIOT AND TURKISH CYPRIOT MANAGE TO GET ALONG
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By CHARLES M. SENNOTT c.1998 The Boston Globe
PYLA , Cyprus _ On an island divided by concertina wire and hatred , this may be the only village where ethnic Greeks and Turks live side by side and manage to get along .
The village is tiny , no more than a few hundred people .
And on the only main road is a Turkish mosque , with its Ottoman minaret , and a Greek church , with its red-tiled steeple .
The church 's bell tower is newly rebuilt to be slightly higher than the mosque 's minaret .
Between the church and the mosque are two cafes that sit opposite each other .
One is the Turkish-owned Kahvehanesi Coffee House and the other is the Greek-owned Trohos Tavern .
The patrons of these rustic-looking , white stucco cafes sit under the shade of verandas and stare across at one another .
The two sides don n't talk much , the locals admit , but they stare at one another a lot .
Hasan Mehmet , 70 , sat looking out over the stucco arches of the Turkish coffee house sipping a small cup of black and powerful Turkish coffee .
Asked if he thought the peace talks headed by US envoy Richard Holbrooke , which broke down on May 4 , could be restarted , he laughed and answered , `` No. ''
`` Look , we aren n't going to have a solution .
But in the meantime we just sit here and drink coffee and try to avoid each other as much as possible , '' he said .
`` When we do talk , we argue .
But we don n't fight . ''
Across the road at the Greek cafe , Yambos Pavlo peered out over sunglasses and said , `` It 's not that Turks and Greeks can n't live together .
We lived together for hundreds of years .
It 's just politics that has left this island so divided .
It has very little to do with the people . ''
Cyprus has been divided into rival ethnic Turkish and Greek Cypriot zones since 1974 , when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island in response to a short-lived coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece .
Since then the island , and its central city of Nicosia , have been divided by a `` green line '' of sandbags and barbed wire monitored by UN forces .
Tensions on the island have been running high lately since Holbrooke , who brokered a peace deal in Bosnia , announced talks aimed at reunification of the island were not going anywhere .
Heightening tensions further is a spiraling arms race .
This August , the Greek Cypriot government is expected to receive shipment of advanced Russian surface-to-air missiles .
The Turks have vowed to retaliate by using their US-made and US-funded F-16 fighter planes to destroy the missiles if they are delivered .
Analysts worry this could touch off a confrontation between Greece and Turkey and destabilize the region .
But through nearly a quarter century of conflict and division , Pyla has managed to stay bicultural .
Most of the Greeks fled the northern part of the island when the Turks occupied it .
And most of the Turks fled the rest of the island , fearing reprisals from Greeks .
But not in Pyla .
`` Why ?
It 's the question everyone asks , '' says Michael Diffily , a Dublin police detective who is now on a military tour with the United Nations post in Pyla .
`` And we never have an answer . ''
The blue observation tower of the UN post stands in the middle of the town .
Most observers say the glue that holds Pyla together is the British military base , where many of the villagers work .
They are maintenance workers , chefs , engineers , and secretaries to the British military based there .
And Greeks and Turks work together .
The military base has spawned a British-style bar known as `` The King 's Leather Pub . ''
The place is famous for serving the best pints of creamy Guinness stout on the island .
Here both Greeks and Turks duck out of the hot Cypriot sun to join the British soldiers for drinks after a day of work .
`` The base has something to do with why people here get along , '' said a British officer who has been stationed here for 10 years .
`` But if you ask me , it 's the stout that keeps everyone at peace . ''
