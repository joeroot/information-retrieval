& HT ; COMMENTARY : Ultra-partisan politics devouring us & HT ; For release Wednesday , June 3 , 1998 .
& HT ; By Howard Kleinberg & HT ; c.

Political carnivorousness remains unabated , partisan appetites never satiated .
Hypocrisy _ a technical-sounding term for the droppings of a male cow _ is the main ingredient of much of it .
Two great recent examples are the incongruous rantings of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as he spews his double-speak bile about the Middle East _ a breach of U.S. political ethics _ and last weekend 's so-called response to President Clinton 's Saturday radio address .
In the latter , Sen. Kit Bond ( R-Mo . ) used his time to assault the Clinton administration for turning `` a blind eye to the evils of illegal drugs . ''
That this was a `` response '' and that Clinton 's Saturday talk had nothing to do with illegal drugs and everything to do with prayer in the schools only documents that these responses are not responses at all but planned political strikes .
Bond 's script was not unique to Republicans ; Democrats employed the same tactics during the years of Reagan-Bush .
If the opposition party can not respond meaningfully to what the president is talking about , then it ought not respond at all .
What made Bond 's response so distasteful to me was that for all the years ( 12 ) of the Reagan and Bush administrations , whatever attention they gave to their highly publicized war on drugs met with failure .
Bush pumped millions into the war , trying to head off the drugs at their origins .
It was a colossal failure , partly because it was trying to stem a tidal wave with a sponge and partly because his hand-picked drug czar , former Florida Gov. Bob Martinez , ran a sloppy shop fraught with political patronage .
While the nation remained a dumping ground for illegal drugs , Martinez 's office became a dumping ground for people with friends in high places .
Bond could have mentioned that but he didn n't .
His role was to skewer the president .
Then there 's Gingrich , who has done much to fan the crisis between the United States and Israel over the Palestinian situation .
On the eve of his trip to the Middle East , Gingrich began promoting his own foreign policy , squarely on the side of the Israelis and castigating Secretary of State Madeline Albright for , he said , being on the side of the Palestinians .
The Atlanta Constitution , in an editorial , briskly reminded Motor Mouth of a 1984 article he wrote for the newspaper that condemned legislative meddling in U.S. foreign policy .
According to the Constitution , Gingrich said such intrusions were dangerous , unpatriotic and unconstitutional .
At the time , Gingrich was being critical of 10 congressmen who wrote a letter to Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega criticizing the Reagan administration for its policy toward Nicaragua .
Gingrich wrote that the letter crossed the bounds of legitimate opposition to American policy .
So did what he had to say about the need for the U.S. to recognize Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel , even though you may agree with him .
It was a foreign policy statement that crossed the bounds .
As to his remarks about Albright , it not only was wrong but it was highly personal , insulting and treacherous .
That Gingrich later took a photo opportunity , shaking hands with Yasser Arafat , simply documents his duplicitous personality and tactics .
I must repeat : The GOP does not have an exclusive on the purely partisan tactics that are so erosive of our national integrity .
Somewhere between the radicalism of both sides sit the American people , being lied to and deceived year after year , confused by distorted accusations often fostered by paid political lobbyists who really run the country .
Bond , in his response that wasn n't , laid a lot of the blame of violent crime on young kids using drugs .
He never mentioned anything about young kids using guns .
I wonder why ?
