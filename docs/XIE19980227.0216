Last Boeing 707 Pulled from Service for Chinese Airlines
CHENGDU , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The last Boeing 707 airplane to serve Chinese airlines has been removed from service in the fleet of China Southwest Airlines based in Chengdu , capital of Sichuan Province .
The B2410 aircraft was one of 10 Boeing aircrafts ordered by China in 1973 , after then U.S. President Nixon visited China in 1972 .
It was the most advanced plane in the world at that time .
The Boeing airplane has served safely in China for 25 years on the air route from Chengdu to Lhasa , capital of Tibet Autonomous Region .
The route over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau , the " Roof of the World , " is one of the most difficult for airplanes .
The plane has flown nearly 25 million kilometers on the Lhasa route , which means that it has flown the equivalent of going around the Earth 's equator more than 600 times .
The plane will soon fly to the Persian Gulf and become part of the " Flying Dolphin Airlines " of the United Arab Emirates .
