Kenya to Rake in $ 233 Million in Revenue
NAIROBI , December 28 ( Xinhua ) -- The Kenyan government expects to raise 14 billion Shillings ( 233 million U.S. Dollars ) in revenue collection in December , as stringent fiscal and monetary measures implemented since July begin to show results .
The measures were introduced in the 1998 / 99 ( July / June ) budget to reduce expenditure to levels consistent with revenue receipts , the East African weekly reported Monday .
The Customs & AMP ; Excise Department brought in the bulk of the revenue for the month with 6.5 billion Shillings ( 108.3 million Dollars ) , followed by the Income Tax Department at 5.9 billion Shillings ( 98.3 million Dollars ) and Value Added Tax at 1.6 billion Shillings ( 26.6 million Dollars ) .
The government and analysts seem agreed that if the targets set for December are met , it will imply that government revenues are on course to meet their second quarter target in the current financial year , said the report .
This has been a bone of contention between the Kenyan government and international monetary organizations , with Nairobi being accused of not tightening revenue collection because of corruption and inefficiency .
Governmental receipts improved in the first quarter of the 1998 / 99 fiscal year to 42.6 billion Shillings ( 710 million Dollars ) from 40.2 billion Shillings ( 670 million Dollars ) in the same period of the previous year .
Among measures adopted by Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae is the creation of the new positions of financial controllers and their posting to all ministries and departments two months ago .
The government has promised to achieve a balanced budget , reduce government borrowing requirements and start to repay the current stock of short-term Treasury Bills .
