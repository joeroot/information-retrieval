Arafat Hopes 1999 Will See State of Palestine
WASHINGTON , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday said he hopes 1999 will be " the year of the independent Palestinian state , " and urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to help him support peace in the Middle East .
" I hope that this year will be the year of the independent Palestinian state ....
We say that holy Jerusalem is going to be its capital , " Arafat said at a gathering of Arab Americans in suburban Virginia outside Washington .
The questions of Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood are two of the most explosive issues that the Israelis and Palestinians still have to tackle in permanent status talks , which have just resumed .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to annex huge chunks of Palestinian land if Arafat declares a state next May .
The Clinton administration has cautioned against unilateral acts by either side .
Asked later about the dangers of declaring a state , Arafat said the Oslo peace accord reached in September 1993 gives him the right to do it after the interim period expires in May 1999 .
Constant U.S. attention is crucial , the Palestinian leader said , because " there are enemies of peace in more than one place . "
Arafat is scheduled to meet Clinton at the White House Monday .
Clinton plans in two weeks to visit Israel , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
Arafat is in Washington to attend an international donors ' conference Monday that is expected to boost U.S. aid to the Palestinians beyond the 500 million U.S. dollars delivered over the past five years and to get other wealthy countries to kick in more as well .
Five years ago , 2.3 billion U.S. dollars was pledged at a similar conference to assist the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza .
Arafat also had lunch Sunday with Secretary of Commerce William Daley and a group of 15 American business leaders .
Daley said he hoped Monday 's conference , which will be attended by officials from more than 40 countries , will stimulate the private sector to be more active in investing in Palestinian areas .
Daley , who recently returned from the Middle East , also reiterated the U.S. pledge to promote financial prosperity in Gaza and the region .
" I am committed to helping chairman Arafat involve the business community in the Middle East peace process , " Daley said .
" A lasting peace can only be built on economic stability and jobs . "
