Forget acting .
Forget $ 20 million a movie .
Forget Ace Ventura , The Mask and even Truman Burbank .
Jim Carrey was born to be a movie critic .
And , typically , he has some Carrey-style outrageousness to share .
`` ` Titanic ' wasn n't that big a deal , '' he proclaims as he settles into a Beverly Hills hotel suite .
`` Big deal , you fall in love _ you know you 're gon na die .
They 're saying , ` This is till the end of time ' _ which is coming in about 20 minutes .
` So let 's hang on , let 's really work at this . ' That 's no commitment , man ! ''
The Canadian comic and former `` In Living Color '' star presumably thinks better of another film , one he himself is headlining and which , even before its June 5 release , has earned sensational buzz .
`` Profound '' is not a word usually associated with Jim Carrey movies or , for that matter , with summer flicks in general , but many who 've seen the film have been applying it to Carrey 's latest cinematic effort , `` The Truman Show . ''
The actor / comedian plays Truman Burbank , a 30-year-old man who unknowingly has grown up from birth before America 's eyes on television : His entire life is a mammoth extravaganza set in a giant sound stage built to resemble an idyllic oceanside village .
Hidden cameras dot the faux community , zeroing in on Truman as he goes about his days : Greeting the neighbors , selling life insurance , mowing the lawn .
His wife and best pal are actors , who enter their `` scenes '' with Truman by plugging beer or some other product .
He is the unwitting focal point of this town , yet he is restless , and as the facade of his tele-existence slowly peels away , he becomes increasingly desperate .
`` The Truman Show '' comments on the invasiveness of the media , as well as how much we are willing to conform to societal norms to stay happy .
The film , directed by Australian auteur Peter Weir _ director of `` Picnic at Hanging Rock '' ( 1975 ) , `` Gallipoli '' ( 1981 ) , `` Witness '' ( 1985 ) , `` Dead Poets Society '' ( 1989 ) and `` Fearless '' ( 1993 ) _ is deep and deeper , a far cry from Carrey 's `` Ace Ventura '' noodlings or `` Liar , Liar '' ( 1997 ) .
Nevertheless , it allows the comic moments for his trademark uproarious inspiration .
`` This script was a realization of something that I 'd already thought about , suddenly come to fruition somehow , '' says Carrey , a tall , lanky guy looking uncharacteristically GQ in a dashing , pinstriped navy suit .
`` And also it was a major departure for me , so when Peter was connected to it , I thought , ` How can I go wrong ?
If I can n't trust him , I basically can n't be directed . '' '
Carrey , who himself has lived in a media fishbowl since his hit movies earned him an asking price of $ 20 million per film , responded to the material on a personal level , he says .
`` It 's very parallel to my life in many , many ways , '' Carrey says .
`` There are a lot of levels to think about on this movie .
Everybody at some point gets to a point where they have to separate themselves from what other people want for them and what they want for themselves .
And in order to do that , you have to go into unknown territory , you have to take a risk of losing everything .
`` There 's also the reality of my life and the media attention _ people love me , and their kids love me , '' he says .
`` But if I meet 50 of them in a day , someone 's gon na be disappointed , you know ?
Because I have emotions , and I get tired and everything else .
That adoration , when you don n't realize how much is being metered out to a person , can actually be dangerous .
This film has so many levels . ''
Carrey revels in the fact that `` The Truman Show '' is unlike anything he 's done before .
`` The one thing you do come out of this picture with are thoughts , '' he says .
`` A lot of films , you walk out and you 're ready to go see the next whatever , the next thrill ride .
I think of this as a psychological thrill ride _ it 's a thrill ride , but it takes place inside you . ''
After often working with journeyman filmmakers who were content to point their cameras and let him uncork his crazed improvisations , Carrey relished working with a director of Weir 's stature , not to mention his trademark meticulous preparation .
`` He showed up at my house with a binder full of pictures and things that he had put together that might inspire me to feel the aesthetic of this movie , '' Carrey recalls .
`` There was some Salvador Dali stuff in there , sometimes just a cutout of a kid standing on a beach looking out .
`` You think , ` Oh my gosh .
This guy 's really working at this .
He 's an artist , and I 'm gon na have to do my best . '' '
Needless to say , Carrey found Weir 's approach a far cry from the almost-anything-goes style of his early films .
`` What you do is you give ' em all the crap first , then anything is an improvement , '' he says .
`` I used to write that way on ` In Living Color . ' Honest to God , we wanted to get such bizarre stuff on there that sometimes I would have to include even more bizarre stuff that I knew was totally over the line , so they 'd have something to cut .
`` They 'd go , ` Well , you definitely can n't do that . ' I 'd negotiate , '' he recalls .
`` ` Dammit , ' I 'd say , but I got the stuff in that I wanted . ''
That 's sort of how Carrey is running his career now .
Having won an enormous fan base by exploiting his maniacal persona , he has won the clout to make films which speak more personally to him .
`` It 's a little bit of a Salvador Dali painting , this movie , in the way that personally , I 've been showing you what 's on the surface and all that , '' he says , `` but now I 'm lifting up the ocean to show you the sleeping dog there .
`` Everybody has a sleeping dog , that thing about to be revealed , '' Carrey adds , `` and I 'm grateful that I had Peter at this moment to lead me into that and allow these other colors to be seen .
`` This movie is my adolescence as an actor , '' he says .
`` I 'm not just satisfied with looking at everything whimsically , I have other things to discover . ''
Growth is imperative as a performer , Carrey says .
He 's come a long way from his early days in show business , wowing audiences at comedy clubs in Toronto and Los Angeles .
`` It used to drive me crazy , '' he says .
`` I saw guys there that had been doing stand-up since I started , which was a good 15 years , and they were still doing the same 20 minutes of material .
`` You can n't live that way , '' Carrey insists .
`` You can n't .
You 've got to believe , ` If I go into the abyss , and I take a chance , there will be a reward for me sometime . '
`` You 've got to be willing to make a fool of yourself in this business , otherwise you don n't get to those interesting places . ''
