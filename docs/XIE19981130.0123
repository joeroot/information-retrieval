Commentary : Two Decades of China 's Dynamic Diplomacy ( 4 )
The development momentum of Sino-Japanese relations has continued in recent years , with the two important neighboring states in East Asia scoring great stride in wide-ranging cooperation and exchanges .
This year marks the 20th anniversary of China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty .
President Jiang has returned from a state visit to Japan during which the two sides agreed to build a friendly and cooperative 21st century partnership devoted to peace and development .
China has entered a new period with the comprehensive development of relations with Europe , including members of European Union ( EU ) such as Germany , Britain and France .
President Jiang visited Germany in 1995 and pointed out that the guiding principles for relations between China and West Europe center on mutual respect , equality , mutual benefits and seeking common interests while setting difference aside .
Said principles have established a solid foundation for strengthening cooperative Sino-European relations .
Last February , the EU decided to refrain from tabling anti-China resolutions during the annual session of United Nations Commission on Human Rights .
A short time later , in March , the European Commission released a document entitled " Building a Comprehensive Partnership with China " which advocated strengthening relations between China and the EU .
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji held his first meeting with EU leaders last April and the two sides stressed their willingness to form a healthy and stable constructive partnership geared to the 21st century and to devise mechanisms for regular annual meetings .
The smooth resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the approaching return of Macao undoubtedly represent the victory of Deng Xiaoping 's monumental concept of " one country , two systems . "
Relations between China and Britain also improved since the handover of Hong Kong , with reciprocal visits by Premier Zhu and British Prime Minister Tony Blair injecting new vitality into Sino-British relations .
