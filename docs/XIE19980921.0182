Highway Helps Protect Taklimakan Desert
URUMQI , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- A highway running through the Taklimakan Desert , the largest in China , has been conducive to protecting the local environment since it opened three years ago .
A recent investigation has dispelled concerns expressed by some experts that the highway would pose a threat to the environment , since now desert animals and plants both thriving along the road .
The numerous ponds and water holes left by the road construction are also providing greater water resources for the animals and plants , according to experts .
The investigation also found that natural sand plants and newly planted greenery along the road are also serving to control the shifting desert sands .
Located in the heart of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , the Taklimakan was known as the " Sea of Death " until the area became active with oil exploration .
