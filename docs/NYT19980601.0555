FORMER PROFESSOR SUES UNIVERSITY OVER DAMAGED CAREER
( js ) By KEVIN SACK c.1998 N.Y .

ATLANTA _ Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , a former Emory University business professor who lost an appointment at the Georgia Institute of Technology after Emory officials accused him of vandalism , has filed a lawsuit charging Emory with trumping up charges against him and sabotaging his career .
In the lawsuit filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta , Sonnenfeld seeks reappointment to his tenured teaching position and unspecified monetary damages .
An Emory spokeswoman , Nancy Seideman , said the university had not received a copy of the lawsuit and would have no comment .
But in an exchange of letters with Sonnenfeld 's lawyer earlier this year , Emory 's general counsel , Joseph Crooks , brushed off the professor 's claims .
`` To the extent that your client 's reputation may have been damaged , he is the author of his own misfortune , and further efforts of this type will only make matters worse for him , '' Crooks wrote .
Last September , Georgia Tech said that it had lured Sonnenfeld away from its wealthier crosstown rival to become dean of its Dupree School of Management .
Because Sonnenfeld was considered an academic star who had won acclaim for his teaching and for the creation of an educational institute for chief executives , his appointment was widely seen as a coup for Georgia Tech .
But before the state Board of Regents could approve the $ 200,000-a-year appointment , Emory officials informed their Georgia Tech counterparts that a security camera at Emory 's Goizueta School of Business had captured Sonnenfeld defacing a wall as he walked down a hallway on Nov. 26 .
When confronted by campus police about the incident , Sonnenfeld resigned from Emory on Dec. 1.
William Chace , Emory 's president , then told Georgia Tech 's president , G. Wayne Clough , about the developments , and Georgia Tech rescinded its offer on Dec. 3 , according to the lawsuit .
A copy of the videotape , which Sonnenfeld said was provided to his lawyer by Emory officials , shows the professor zigzagging down the hallway , apparently kicking the walls lightly as he goes .
Sonnenfeld acknowledges that his behavior appears bizarre .
But he has portrayed it as an eccentricity of a rumpled , often preoccupied professor , and not a criminal act .
`` It wouldn n't be an audition for the Atlanta Ballet , '' he said earlier this year , while watching the videotape .
`` It looks so foolish .
But it 's a lot better to look foolish then felonious .
People do dumb things like that .
I can n't invent a sensible reason for why I 'm doing that . ''
Ms. Seideman declined to comment on whether the university has additional evidence against him .
Sonnenfeld 's lawsuit charges Emory and various university officials with slander , intentional infliction of emotional distress , breach of contract , deprivation of due process rights , and tortious interference with his business dealings .
It suggests that Emory may have acted in retribution for his decision to take the Georgia Tech job after Emory rejected him for the deanship of its own business school .
In the court filing , the 44-year-old professor explains that he resigned only because Emory University Police Capt. Ray Edge had threatened to arrest him on felony vandalism charges if he did not leave Emory immediately .
Since his resignation , Sonnenfeld , 44 , has established , with private financing , an institute in Atlanta for chief executives .
He also has received numerous letters of support from chief executives he has befriended over the years , including the chief executive of the United States .
`` I regret what you 've been through , '' President Clinton wrote .
`` But , as my critics say , I can feel your pain . ''
