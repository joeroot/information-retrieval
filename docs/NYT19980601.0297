DOGS PUTTING THE BITE ON HOUSTON MAIL CARRIERS

HOUSTON _ Houston is the fourth largest city in the United States , but it has the dubious honor of being No. 1 in the nation when counting the number of postal workers bitten by dogs .
`` Whenever you get a lot of unwanted dogs in the area , you will see a lot of dog bites , and that is the case here in Houston , '' said Kathy Barton , spokeswoman for the city 's Department of Health and Human Services .
According to the U.S. Humane Society there were 65 dog bites to Houston postal workers in fiscal 1997 _ the most reported in the country .
The Chicago and Miami areas were ranked No. 2 and No. 3 , respectively .
James Sanchez isn n't surprised that Houston was ranked No. 1.
About a month ago , while delivering the mail , he was attacked by a stray dog .
`` The dog came out from under a car and I tried to kick him loose , but the neighborhood kids came and helped to get him off of my leg , '' Sanchez said .
The number of dog bites is under estimated , said Leslie Sinclair of the U.S. Humane Society .
To increase awareness , the Humane Society and the U.S. Postal Service are dubbing this week as National Dog Bite Prevention Week .
There are more than 4.5 million bite victims each year and last year 2,708 postal workers were bitten , said Sinclair .
Houston law requires owners of all dogs with access to a street or sidewalk be under physical control , generally a leash , at all times .
Animals at large are subject to pick-up by the city 's animal control officers .
The second and each subsequent time a dog bites or attacks a person in Houston , its owner must be fined a minimum of $ 500 .
Sanchez , who has been with the post office for seven years , works the same route where he was bitten , but he 's cautious around dogs .
`` I 'm not usually afraid of dogs , but after this happened you might say I am terrified of them , '' he said .
Edith Arceneaux , 53 , is also terrified of the dogs on her mail route _ a large , white pit bull and another dog that stands about 6 feet tall when on its hind legs .
`` Sometimes I do not deliver people 's mail until the next day because their dog is going crazy , barking and snapping at me , '' she said .
If postal workers feel that they 're in danger at a location , they do not have to deliver mail there that day .
To help keep letter carriers safe each one carries pepper spray to deter attacking dogs .

& LR ; According to the Humane Society most dog bites can be avoided through prevention methods and having responsible owners .
`` The best way to prevent dog bites is for owners to have their dogs spayed and neutered , '' Barton said .
`` Many dog bites are from dogs that are in heat , because they are much more aggressive that way and if you do this it helps to keep the number of strays down . ''
Sanchez said dog bites also can be prevented if owners take responsibility for their dogs by securely tying them up or placing them behind a fence .
`` I want people to take care of their dogs so that I don n't have to worry about getting bit and there are also a lot of kids in these neighborhoods who could be attacked . ''

The majority of dog bite victims are children , said Sinclair .
In February , Vanessa Chavez , 6 , was playing in the front yard of her Houston-area home when a large dog attacked and dragged her along the flower bed .
She had to get 37 stitches .
`` It 's kind of hard to see your daughter who 's usually not afraid of anything now traumatized by the thought of just being outside , '' said Robert Sanchez , Vanessa 's father .
The dog that allegedly bit Vanessa was ordered put to death , but its owners are still appealing the verdict .
`` I hope the prevention week raises awareness in the community because this is a very important problem that needs to be solved , '' Chavez said .
