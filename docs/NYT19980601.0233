NOW EVERY KID CAN HAVE A TWIN
( For use by New York Times News Service clients . ) By CINDY RAMOS c.1998 San Antonio Express-News
SAN ANTONIO _ Four-year-old Brandon Duke 's best buddy is 23 inches tall , with a soft body and a face with a striking resemblance to Brandon 's .
And it 's not just a coincidence .
One day in January , Brandon 's new friend , a My Twinn doll , arrived in the mail .
Since then , he 's stuck to his buddy like glue .
My Twinn dolls _ available by catalog from an Englewood , Colo. , company called My Twinn _ are designed to look exactly like your child .
They are so lifelike , owners say , the dolls are mistaken for children as they sit on a couch or tag along with their owners in public .
Ellen Duke , a physician in San Antonio , has bought four My Twinn dolls , including one matching what she looked like as a young girl .
The other dolls in the Duke household are twins to Brandon ; her oldest son , Eddie ; and her stepdaughter , Christina .
`` I wanted their kids to see how cute they were when they were little , '' Duke said .
`` This is something they can pass on , like an heirloom . ''
A California emergency room doctor created the dolls after noticing nervous young patients often carried their toy dolls with them to ease their fears .
They usually took the doll that looked the most like them .
My Twinn dolls hit the market in 1993 .
My Twinn , a privately owned company , doesn n't release sales figures , but says it sells thousands of dolls annually .
The dolls cost between $ 129.95 and $ 179.95 , depending on the style and outfit .
Designers at My Twinn match face shapes , skin tone , hair types and eye colors according to a child 's photograph and an information sheet mailed in by parents .
Birthmarks , moles and freckles also are copied .
About the only thing that can n't be reproduced are dimples .
For many children who have felt self-conscious about their unique moles and birthmarks on their face , seeing another `` child '' with the same features boosts their self-esteem , said Dave Liggett , public affairs director for My Twinn .
`` They are not just making dolls ; they are making a special gift , '' Liggett said .
One doll was ordered with no legs and arms because its future owner didn n't have her limbs .
Another doll was made for a little girl who must carry an oxygen tank in her backpack due to a serious heart condition .
Her doll has an oxygen tank , too .
Christina Duke , 12 , has a birthmark on her forehead .
Although it has faded over the years , it was more noticeable when she was younger .
Her doll was created with the same birthmark .
`` It 's awesome , '' she said of the fact her doll shares the mark with her .
Christina 's doll was an early gift for her 13th birthday on June 14 .
`` It was amazing , '' Christina said of the resemblance .
`` I was shocked .
I almost started crying . ''
For Duke , having My Twinn dolls of her children is a way to keep them young .
`` They are always going to grow up , but you can never have that feeling again when they were little , '' she said .
My Twinn also sells matching outfits and accessories for doll and child .
