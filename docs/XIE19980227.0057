Canadian Pulp , Paper Industry Gripped By Merger
OTTAWA , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Canada 's pulp and paper industry has been hit by a merger wave that analysts said will last two or three years .
The Montreal-based Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. , the world 's largest newsprint maker , announced Wednesday to bid for Avenor Inc. with 2 billion Canadian dollars ( 1.4 billion U.S. dollars ) .
It will " definitely kick-start " further moves , said independent industry analyst John Duncanson in Toronto .
Many Canadian producers are on the prowl for acquisitions as a way to grow .
One reason is that it 's cheaper to buy existing mills than to build new ones , according to the Globe and Mail newspaper .
The potential for cutting costs is also significant .
Since the former Abitibi Price and Stone Consolidated merged last Spring , they have exceeded their target of 100 million dollars in annual savings and are headed for 200 million dollars by June .
Last year , Canadian producers bought and sold each other 's assets tallying up more than 10 billion dollars in mergers and acquisitions , a record high for the industry .
With several deals already announced or apparently on the horizon , this year looks likely to be even busier , the newspaper predicted .
