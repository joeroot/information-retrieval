Iraq Calls for Quick Implementation of
BAGHDAD , November 29 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan Sunday called for a quick implementation of the contracts signed between Iraq and foreign companies under the oil-for-food program .
In his meeting with Hans Von Sponeck , the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq , Ramadhan expressed disappointment at the previous four phases of the program .
He expressed hope that the fifth phase of the oil-for-food program between Iraq and the U.N. would be strictly implemented .
Ramadan also criticized the U.N. sanctions committee for placing various obstacles in approving the contracts .
" An effective implementation of the new phase of the program can only be guaranteed by full cooperation between both sides , " he said .
The vice president said the U.N. humanitarian coordinator should not forget the fact that more than 22 million Iraqi people were suffering from the U.N. sanctions which has lasted for eight years .
Von Sponeck , who took office in October , said he was optimistic about his mission in Iraq .
George Comerwill , spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq , announced earlier that Iraq has agreed to extend the oil-for-food program for a fifth phase of six months and has submitted to the U.N. a specific plan for implementing the new phase .
The fourth phase of the program expired on November 25 and the U.N. Security Council has voted unanimously to renew the program for another six months .
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 , but approved an oil-for-food deal to allow Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil every six months since December 1996 to buy food , medicine and other humanitarian goods for its hardship-stricken people .
Iraq 's oil export ceiling has been raised to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in the fourth phase from 2 billion dollars in the previous phases .
But Iraq 's dilapidated oil industry and the sagging world oil prices have made it difficult for Iraq to earn that amount .
It only fetch Baghdad 3.3 billion dollars in the fourth phase .
