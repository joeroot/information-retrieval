Effenburg Retires from German National Squad
BONN , September 20 ( Xinhua ) -- Midfielder Stefan Effenberg said on Sunday that he will not play for the German national team but for the club of Bayern Munich .
" I will not play for Germany any more , " Effenberg said on Sunday , weeks after he ended a four-year absence from the international scene , " I want to concentrate on playing for Bayern . "
Germany coah Erich Ribbeck said earlier he was aware that Effenberg , 30 , wanted to step down .
" A lot of things have come together .
He 's the father of three children and the pressure on him at Bayern is very high .
But he hasn n't definitively turned us down yet and has asked for time to think until the middle of the week , " Ribbeck said .
Effenberg was sent home from the 1994 World Cup in disgrace after making an obscene gesture to German fans .
He was not selected again until Ribbeck 's predecessor , Berti Vogts , recalled him last month for two friendly matches .
Vogts quit after those games against Malta and Romania at the beginning of this month but Ribbeck made clear Effenberg was central to his plans .
The new coach said he had met Effenberg and his wife Martina , who is also the player 's manager , in Munich last week and asked him to change his mind .
