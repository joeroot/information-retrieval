HOUSTON POET WINS MACARTHUR GENIUS GRANT
( For use by New York Times News Service clients ) By CLAUDIA FELDMAN c.1998 Houston Chronicle
HOUSTON _ In April , when transplanted Houston poet Edward Hirsch won a prestigious award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters , an aunt in Chicago wondered aloud , `` When are you going to win a prize the family has heard of ? ''
The answer came when the MacArthur Foundation , famous for awarding genius grants to individuals of all ages and backgrounds who do outstanding and creative work , released the names of 29 new honorees .
The MacArthur Foundation has spent $ 166 million on its genius grants since the program 's inception in 1981 .
Hirsch , also a professor in the creative writing program at the University of Houston , was on the list .
`` Everybody in my family is wildly excited , '' Hirsch laughed Monday .
`` They 've heard of this . ''
Hirsch got the news late last week but had to keep it secret until the awards were announced .
`` I was stunned , I 'm still stunned , I don n't know what to think , '' Hirsch said .
As he stood in his Houston study , he held a portable telephone that wouldn n't stop ringing .
With every ring , his black poodle , Rocky , barked .
`` The phone , the dog ...
'' Hirsch muttered .
He will receive a total of $ 295 , 000 , divided into gradually increasing payments during the next five years .
The money will allow him more time to write , he said , but he won n't relinquish his teaching job , which he also loves .
`` The blessing of this grant is I 'll have more opportunities to do my work .
It 's a liberating thing .
I can do fewer extraneous things to make money . ''
At present Hirsch teaches one semester a year at UH , writes a column for the American Poetry Review , serves as poetry editor for the literary magazine , DoubleTake , and tries to concentrate on his own poetry .
At 48 , he has five books of poems .
His latest is `` On Love '' ( Knopf , $ 22 ) .
Almost always , he says , he has a poem he 's working on in his head .
In the early stages , he goes to a fast-food restaurant such as Burger King or McDonald 's to work , because his study is too quiet .
Or it 's too noisy .
Besides , he says , he likes to be surrounded by people , regular working people going about their daily lives .
Then he comes back to his study and his electric typewriter .
The computer age apparently has passed him by .
But don n't get too carried away by his unusual writing habits , he says .
`` Newspaper stories tend to focus on the eccentricities of my process and not on the results themselves .
`` I think I got the award because of my fierce commitment and devotion to poetry and to keeping it alive in our culture .
`` It 's hard because of the tremendous success of mass media .
But I think people have a large spiritual hunger .
They don n't know where to go to satisfy that hunger .
Poetry offers spiritual sustenance . ''
When poet Philip Levine got word of Hirsch 's prize Monday , he cheered .
`` If I were giving the award , he 'd be my first choice , '' said Levine , now living in Fresno , Calif. `` He 's enormously deserving , a brilliant man , and very serious in terms of his commitment to poetry . ''
Levine , himself an American treasure , says Hirsch writes slowly .
`` The more time he can get to write , the more poetry we can get from him .
In terms of his gift , there 's no limit . ''
Levine also has watched Hirsch teach .
`` He 's so skillful and honest and tactful and gentle , yet there 's no B.S . ''
Joel Conarroe , director of the Guggenheim Foundation in New York , echoed Levine 's congratulations .
`` He 's an exemplary artist _ I can n't think of anyone more deserving , '' Conarroe said .
`` He writes poetry that is accessible without being simple .
His work can be appreciated by a wide audience and not just a charmed circle of 300 people .
`` Also , he has a big heart . ''
Hirsch started writing poetry in high school , but it wasn n't until he attended Grinnell College in Iowa that he realized that it would be his life .
He graduated from Grinnell in 1972 and earned his Ph.D .
from the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 .
From there he moved to New York to teach , then moved to Detroit to teach , and came to Houston , again to teach , 10 years ago .
Along the way he married Janet Landay , whose excitement about the MacArthur prize is only surpassed by the happiness of their son , Gabriel .
Hirsch can n't forget the day Gabriel turned to him and said , `` We 're poets , aren n't we , Dad ? ''
