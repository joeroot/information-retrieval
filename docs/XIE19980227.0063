Campaign Finance Legislation Shelved Again in
WASHINGTON , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Supporters of a campaign finance reform bill failed Thursday to break a Republican-led filibuster -- the delaying tactics , leaving the measure dead for the foreseeable future .
The vote was 51 - 48 , 9 votes short of the 60 needed to overcome the filibuster .
Shortly afterward , Majority Leader Trent Lott , a Republican announced he would remove the measure from the floor and begin debating unrelated legislation .
Prior to the vote lawmakers supporters and opponents repeated arguments on legislation designed to clean up the current scandal-scarred system for financing political campaigns .
Senator Ken Conrad , a Democrat , called the current funding system " broken ...
rotten ...
corrupting " and said it ought to be changed .
But Senator Mitch McConnell , a Republican , said the measure , with limitations on certain types of campaign spending , would violate the Constitution .
The bipartisan bill , drafted by Senators John McCain , a Republican and Russell Feingold , a Democrat , would ban unregulated so-called " soft money " -- donations to national political parties coming from corporations , labor unions and individuals .
It also would impose fresh curbs on labor unions and on advertisements that attack candidates but escape regulation because they are presented as " issue ads " not covered by existing election law .
Supporters say changes in the current law are needed to avoid a repetition of abuses in previous Presidential campaigns .
Opponents say the bill violates the free-speech guarantee in the First Amendment to the Constitution .
Feingold said on Wednesday evening that support would grow during the coming election season , as candidates are pressed to give their commitments to support campaign finance legislation .
But McConnell countered , " No one in the history of American politics has ever won or lost a campaign on this issue . "
On Wednesday , the Senate agreed to a compromise on the issue of union dues and attack ads , that had been written by Senator Olympia Snowe , a Republican .
Under her amendment , unions would be barred from using dues money and corporations would be barred from using their own funds to pay for loosely regulated " issue advertisements " used to attack candidates within 60 days of an election .
Other organizations would be permitted to air such ads , subject to speedy disclosure .
That provision loosened restrictions on such advertising that was contained in the original bill , but was significantly less onerous for organized labor than a proposal that Republicans had been advocating .
Even with that modification , the McCain-Feingold legislation could not attract additional support from Republicans .
