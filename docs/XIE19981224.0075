Profile : Nepali PM Girija Prasad Koirala
KATHMANDU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Girija Prasad Koirala , who was reappointed prime minister of Nepal Wednesday by King Birendra , was administered oath of office Thursday by King Birendra .
Under the agreement reached Sunday with the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxism-Leninism , CPN-UML ) , Koirala will form a coalition government to conduct free , fair and impartial elections by March / April 1999 .
He resigned Monday as prime minister of a minority government to make way for such a coalition government , but he regained the premiership as he won the support of 135 members in the 205-seat Lower House of Parliament .
This is the third time for 73-year-old Koirala to serve as prime minister of the Himalayan kingdom .
He first took office in May 1991 as the kingdom 's first popularly elected prime minister in 30 years .
In March 1994 , he resigned and recommended mid-term polls after losing a key vote in parliament .
The polls in November 1994 produced a hung parliament where no single party held a majority , which , in turn led to the emergence of coalition politics in the country .
But Koirala was reelected member of the Lower House .
In May 1996 , he was elected president of the Nepali Congress ( NC ) at the party 's 9th general convention .
Now he is also the parliamentary leader of the NC , the single largest party in parliament .
In April this year , he became prime minister of a minority government , which turned a majority in August with the induction of the Communist Party of Nepal ( Marxism-Leninism , CPN-ML ) .
However , the CPN-ML pulled out on December 10 , alleging that Koirala had failed to abide by the agreements reached with it and other left parties in August .
Koirala succeeded in finding new partners and regained the premiership .
