European Markets In A Festive Mood
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- European leading shares closed at their highest point for five months after a positive session on Wall Street gave rise to last minute dash before Christmas .
London 's FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended up 65.5 points at 5,908.8 thanks to the prospect of further interest rate cuts and a strong start on Wall Street .
There are growing hopes for another imminent cut in interest rates after minutes from the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee showed members had voted eight-to-one in favor of a 0.5 percent rate cut at its December meeting .
" The MPC minutes suggest rates will be cut by three quarters of a point or a point in the first quarter of next year , " said a trader in the City .

The rally lifted traders ' hopes for an end of the year boost to take the blue-chip Dax above the 5,000-point level .

Paris blue-chip Cac-40 index closed up 51.95 points or 1.36 percent at 3,872.42 in a swing amplified by the thin pre-holiday volume totaling 6.8 billion French francs ( 1.2 billion U.S. dollars ) .
