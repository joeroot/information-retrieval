British Envoy Arrives in Cyprus for EU Accession
NICOSIA , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- British special envoy for Cyprus David Hannay said here Thursday that he seeks to secure an agreed approach regarding the participation of Turkish Cypriots in the Cyprus-European Union ( EU ) accession negotiations .
He made the remark at Larnaca airport upon his arrival for a 24-hour visit , during which he will meet President Glafcos Clerides and hold talks with Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides to discuss a formula for Turkish Cypriot participation in EU accession process .
Hannay told reporters that one of the main objectives he will be pursuing in the Cyprus problem is to resume the peace process initiated last June .
Two rounds of U.N . - sponsored direct talks last summer between the Greek and Turkish communities ' leaders failed to produce any results following the refusal of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to continue the talks in protest against a decision of the EU to start membership talks with the Cypriot government .
Referring to Cyprus-EU accession talks , the British envoy said according to the Luxembourg EU summit conclusions his country , holding the present EU presidency , " will have to see whether a joint Cyprus negotiating team can be constituted for the accession negotiations , due to start on March 31 . "
Cyprus is one of the six countries which will start accession negotiations with the EU in March .
" That is a task which has been given to the presidency and the Commission , " he said , adding that EU External Relations Commissioner , Hans van den Broek , will be in Cyprus next week .
The British diplomat acknowledged that the participation of the Turkish Cypriots is " a complex and sensitive subject . "
For this reason , he said he wants to hear the views of the Cypriot government , " what is their idea in these matters and how we can take this forward . "
The government has proposed Turkish Cypriot participation in EU membership talks , provided that the Turkish Cypriot side accepts the principle of Cyprus ' accession to the EU and the Turkish Cypriot representatives are part of the Republic 's negotiating team .
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has angrily denounced the EU 's decision on membership talks with the Cypriot governnment and ordered suspension of bicommunal activities and contacts with the Greek Cypriot side since last December in retaliation for the EU 's move .
The British envoy said he may not meet this time with Denktash , who has repeatedly said that he will not see Hannay .
" I am rather saddened by that , particularly since the explanation seems to me a rather inadequate one .
But that 's his choice , " he added .
Denktash refuses to meet Hannay because of British government 's decision last month to require visas for Turkish Cypriots travelling to Britain .
London has explained that the measure was introduced after increasing numbers of Turkish Cypriots asking for political asylum in Britain .
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over 37 percent of the island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia .
