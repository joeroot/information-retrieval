Three Million Women Have Abortions Annually in
NAIROBI , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- An estimated three million women in sub-Saharan Africa have abortions each year , with adolescents accounting for the largest proportion , the East African Standard reported Friday .
Nigeria and Kenya have the highest abortion rates in the region , according to a report by the U.S . - based Population Reference Bureau .
Illegal abortions are a major contributor to sub-Saharan Africa 's extremely high rate of maternal mortality , said Thomas Goliber , the bureau chief .
" Some physicians , especially public health doctors , are poorly paid in the region and some provide abortion services as a side practice , " he said .
Dr Fred Sai , former president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation , was quoted as saying that there are at least 150,000 pregnancy-related deaths in Africa each year , a quarter of them due to unsafely procured abortions .
Except in South Africa , abortion is illegal or severely restricted in sub-Saharan Africa .
The laws regulating pregnancy termination in most states in the region were inherited from old colonial times .
South Africa passed the Choice on Termination Bill in 1996 , which permits abortion on demand from the 12th week of pregnancy and makes it easily available through the 20th week .
