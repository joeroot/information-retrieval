Defense Exposition to Be Held in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The Defense Exposition of South Africa ( DEXSA ) ' 98 is due to be held between November 17 and 21 at an airforce base outside Pretoria , a news release said Sunday .
DEXSA ' 98 , different from its previous ones which focused closely on presenting South African defense equipment to potential buyers , will become an international defense exposition , the organizers said .
More than 110 companies from 21 countries have taken space at DEXSA ' 98 to showcase themselves to the South African and other African armed forces .
National pavilions have been set up for companies from Germany , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Russia , Spain , Sweden , Britain and the United States .
There will also be 131 South African companies displaying a range of defense and related products .
DEXSA ' 98 is the fourth " Dexsa " , and will probably be the last in the present form .
The current thinking is that from 2000 , DEXSA will be combined with Aerospace Africa to develop a larger , more efficient vehicle for demonstrating defense and related equipment and systems , the organizers said .
