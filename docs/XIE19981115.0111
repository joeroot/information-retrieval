LUSAKA , November 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The Zambian government is fully committed to tackling the long vexing poverty facing the country and has lined up a five-point strategy to deal with problem , according to Sunday Times of Zambia .
The local newspaper quoted acting Community and Social Development Minister Newstead Zimba as saying Saturday in Ndola , northern Zambia , that the five-point plan is aimed at reducing poverty by at least 20 percent by the year 2004 .
Opening a one-day national consensus building workshop on the poverty reduction draft plan , he said the plan is geared toward achieving broad based socio-economic growth through agricultural and rural development , the provision of the requisite public physical infrastructure as well as increasing the productivity of urban micro-enterprises and informal sector .
Emphasis is to be placed on human resources development as well as the coordination , monitoring and evaluation of the various poverty reduction programs and activities , he said .
Zimba , who is also Information Minister , said the plan is a crucial component of the government moves to help lift the people out of their poverty-stricken levels and instead participate fully in the process of national development .
Zimba said his country has now been listed among the least developed countries in the world with at least 70 percent of its population living in abject poverty .
" This means that 70 percent of the population live in a situation of inadequate basic needs like food , clothing , housing , education and health .
With this level of poverty , it is difficult to attain acceptable socio-economic development , " Zimba said .
