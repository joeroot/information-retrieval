MANY SMALL COMPANIES HOPING FOR TAKEOVERS

Is there any hope for the small-stock investor ?
J.D .
Sullivan , vice president of Carleton , McCreary , Holmes & AMP ; Co. , believes that there are only two ways for small companies to get out of the orphanage .
One is to be acquired , the other is to do a merger of equals that lifts the company out of the small _ and ignored _ market-cap range .
Indeed , Sullivan thinks that leveraged buyout funds , flush with more than $ 50 billion that they raised last year from investors , are prime potential buyers of orphaned companies .
His firm identifies companies with solid balance sheets and double-digit returns on stockholders ' equity that buyout fund managers might consider buying .
`` These are good companies with good managements , reasonable products and growth rates , '' Sullivan said .
Recently , Sullivan 's group advised Linsalata Capital Partners , a private equity fund , on its purchase of Transzonic Cos. , a diversified company with businesses in industrial textiles , cleaning and safety products .
Transzonic , whose stock traded roughly 15,000 shares a week on the American Stock Exchange , was a classic orphan .
For two years before the buyout , its stock fetched an average $ 14 a share .
When Linsalata bought it , shareholders received $ 29 a share in cash .
Sullivan and his colleagues at Carleton , McCreary , Holmes , which is the investment banking arm of Keycorp , have compiled a list of six orphaned companies that they think would make attractive candidates for buyout funds .
They are : Alltrista Corp. , a 1993 spinoff from Ball Corp. , the home-canning supplier ; Dravo Corp. , the world 's largest publicly traded producer of lime ; Fansteel Inc. , a specialty metals manufacturer ; Figgie International , the maker of aviation navigation devices and breathing equipment ; Midland Co. , a property-casualty insurer and inland waterway shipper ; and Oglebay Norton , a shipping company in the Great Lakes region that is also a maker of industrial sand .
`` All of these companies are moving toward the kind of radical change needed to unlock the intrinsic value of the enterprise , '' Sullivan said .
