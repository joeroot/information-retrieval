Prices Expected to Rebound in Shanghai Next Year
SHANGHAI , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- The overall price level in this leading Chinese economic and commercial center is expected to rise slightly next year , according to official forecasts .
The consumer price index , which also includes the cost of services , is expected to rise by 4.5 to six percent in 1999 , while the retail price index is likely to go up by 2.5 to 3.5 percent , said a municipal government report .
Official statistics show that Shanghai 's consumer price index edged up 0.5 percent in the first ten months of this year , while the retail price index dropped 4.9 percent , making the overall level the lowest since 1984 .
The consumer price index for all of this year is expected to remain the same as for last year , while the year-end retail price index is expected to go down five percentage points from a year ago .
The report said that since China will continue to restructure the economy and boost domestic demand , overall prices are likely to go up steadily .
It added that prices for grain , meat , eggs , fresh vegetables and oil-bearing materials are likely to rise , while those for fresh fruits and industrial consumer goods are expected to decline .
Housing and service costs will rise , probably by a relatively high rate , the report concluded .
