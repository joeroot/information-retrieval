Iraq Says Flight Ban Is for Satety 's Sake
UNITED NATIONS , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- Iraq said here on Thursday that its ban on U.N. flight out of the country was for safety 's sake while the United States and British military plans continue to fly over southern Iraq .
Nizar Hamdoon , Iraq 's Ambassador to the United Nations , said " There is a postponement of that flight because of the situation regarding the current military action as the British and American military jets fly over most of southern Iraq . "
The United Nations has been told that Secretary-General Kofi Annan 's Special Representative in Baghdad , Prakash Shah , was unable to leave for a 10-day holiday by air on " security " grounds and had to go by road to Jordan instead .
Hamdoon said all U.N. flights were temporarily halted because of the risk of cross-fire .
" It 's not a ban .
it 's a holding of those flights because of the dangers that are involved .
There might be cross-fire that could endanger those flights , " he said .
