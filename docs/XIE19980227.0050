Chirac Urges U.S. to Help Revive Mideast Peace
PARIS , February 26 ( Xinhua ) -- French President Jacques Chirac Thursday urged the United States to " rapidly take a strong initiative " to push for a revival of the Mideast peace process .
" Taking into account the very firm position taken by the United States toward Iraq , even though we are no longer in the same situation as the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 , it seems to me that the Americans should rapidly take a strong initiative to help relaunch the peace process , " said Chirac in an interview with the daily Le Monde .
He said that the Iraqi crisis also helped reflect the " unbearable character of the current impasse of the peace process for Arab opinions , " because the Arabs accuse the United States of adopting a double standard in its policy toward Iraq on the one hand and the peace process on the other .
" France does not accept the programmed death of the peace process .
It should be imperatively saved and relaunched , " said Chirac .
He said that it seems that the Americans , who have been reluctant to let Europeans meddle in its mediation between Israel and the Palestinians , are now more open to a European participation .
" The United States needs to rally all the good wills to relaunch the dynamic of peace in the respect of the agreements of Oslo , Taba and Hebron , " he said .
Without naming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Chirac accused him of " being on the way of achieving the killing of the process " and called on him to learn from his predecessors -- Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres .
