Djibouti Cuts Official Ties With Eritrea
NAIROBI , November 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Djibouti severed diplomatic ties with Eritrea Wednesday after Asmara accused it of backing Ethiopia 's war effort , a report quoted Djibouti 's foreign ministry as saying in a statement .
Djibouti said its mission in Asmara , the eritrean capital was closed and Ambassador Ahmed Issa Gabode had been recalled back along with his staff .
The statement demanded Eritrea recall its ambassador to Djibouti , and said it would serve him with notice of the diplomatic severance Wednesday evening .
Djibouti demands Eritrea 's foreign ministry " close down its embassy in Djibouti and recall its diplomatic personnel , " the statement said .
The government " informs the authorities in Asmara that the embassy of Yemen in Asmara shall serve the interests of the republic of Djibouti and those of its nationals , " it said .
Disputes occurred when Djibouti was accused of backing Ethiopia 's armed conflict with Eritrea .
several hundreds died in May and June in the conflict , which has since cooled down although both sides continue to reinforce positions in the border area .
Earlier this month Eritrea accused Djibouti of letting Ethiopia use its port as a conduit for military equipment to use in the conflict .
At the meeting in Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso last week , Eritrea questioned whether Djibouti is qualified to be one of the three mediators assigned by the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) to mediate on the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict .
Djibouti 's decision to cut diplomatic ties stems from " serious and baseless accusations leveled by the Eritrean president against our country , " the statement said .
Most of Ethiopia 's imports and exports have been come through the port of Djibouti since the conflict began in May with Eritrea .
In the past , Addis Ababa used the Eritrean ports of Assab and Massawa .
