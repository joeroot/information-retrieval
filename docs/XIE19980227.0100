Lesotho Parliament Dissolved for Poll
JOHANNESBURG , February 27 ( Xinhua ) -- Lesotho 's parliament was dissolved Friday by King Letsie III to pave the way for the country 's third general election on May 23 , South Africa Press Association reported .
The dissolution followed the adjournment of both houses of parliament Thursday .
The six political parties contesting the elections have geared up for campaign .
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy ( LCD ) faces an obstacle following the Maseru High Court 's ruling last week interdicting the party from using the black , red and green colors also used by its arch-rival , the Basotholand Congress Party ( BCP ) .
It means that the LCD will have to organize meetings and rallies without the flag it adopted when it broke away from the BCP last June .
Seventy-nine-year-old Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle , who recently resigned as LCD leader , has declared that he would not seek re-election .
His deputy , Pakalitha Mosisili , who stepped into his shoes as new LCD leader , and Foreign Minister Kelebone Maope , who is now number two in the LCD , are expected to contest the premiership for the LCD .
Preparations for the poll under the supervision of the Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) are in full swing .
Voter registration ended on Sunday and plans to set up more than 2,400 polling stations countrywide are progressing smoothly , IEC chairman Mafisa Sekara said Thursday .
He said helicopters will be used to deliver votes to hard-to-reach areas .
The newly-elected government will be sworn in on June 4 , after the general election .
