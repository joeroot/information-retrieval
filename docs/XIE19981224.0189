From Poverty to Well-to-Do : An Account of A Farmer 's Family ( 1 )
LANZHOU , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Zhang Guilian is up already at 4 : 00 a.m. , feeding her pigs and then working on her contract land , in hopes of giving her children a better chance , especially in education .
The 45-year-old woman had a miserable childhood .
She was born to a poor family in the village of Wenfeng in Northwest China 's Gansu Province , an area long known for its abject poverty .
Droughts , water shortages , bad transportation , and a scarcity of arable land greatly affected development .
" My parents were struggling to make a living for the family , " she explains , " and they could not even afford a schoolbag for me , " but her younger brothers got a chance to go to school as the family 's living conditions improved .
Changes began to take place in 1978 when China , after a long period of twists and turns , adopted its reform and opening-up policy , and , in rural areas , a household contract responsibility system .
Some policies have been working in remote villages .
Zhang 's family now earns 7,000 yuan annually , and this year she managed to build a six-room house .
Every child in the village now has been recruited in a new primary school .
In the early 1980s , some 20 percent of the pupils dropped out because of financial problems , but not a single one leaves school now for that reason .
Talking about her younger son , Zhang says , " I will do my best to send him to college , " and she sold four pigs without a moment 's hesitation , to get 3,000 yuan when her elder son expressed a desire to learn how to drive and needed money for fees .
The headmaster of the village 's primary school says that the village 's 700 people had never produced a college student before 1995 , but recently , 6 students have gone to two-year colleges or vocational schools .
