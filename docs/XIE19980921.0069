Norwood Stripped of His WBA Featherweight Belt
TOKYO , September 21 ( Xinhua ) -- Title holder Fred Norwood was stripped of his World Boxing Association ( WBA ) featherweight belt on the eve of the match as the American failed to make the weight on Monday .
Norwood weighed 800 grammes ( 28 ounces ) over the limit of 57.9 kg at the first measuring .
He had another chance two hours later but he abandoned the second measuring .
According to his trainer , Norwood said it was impossible for him to make the weight within two hours since he weighed 61.2 kg in the morning and struggled hard throughout the day .
His opponent , Koji Matsumoto of Japan , duly made the weight and he can be the new champion if he can beat Norwood Tuesday .
The WBA featherweight champion will be vacant if Norwood wins .
Norwood , 28 , was never beaten in his professional career , winning 31 times , including 19 KOs , and drawing once .
Matsumoto has 26 wins , including 15 KOs , against five defeats and a draw .
