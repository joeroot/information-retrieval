Footballers Hit back at Elton John
LONDON , December 23 ( Xinhua ) -- The Professional Footballers ' Association has hit back at Elton John 's claims that Premiership players are lazy and overpaid .
The PFA chief executive , Gordon Taylor , said the millionaire popstar and chairman of First Division Watford " should know that the football game is the same as the pop game - it 's about supply and demand .
" Footballers do not put the transfer fees on their heads and neither do they force the clubs to pay such wages .
" Some people may feel the ticket prices for Elton John concerts are too dear .
" Attendances in the Premier League and the Football League are rising so some of the players must be getting it right .
" People would vote their feet if they didn n't think that the players were worth paying to see , " he said .
Earlier the Premier League also joined condemnation of John 's remarks .
Its spokesman Mike Lee said : " No-one is suggesting that the Premiership is perfect , but there is much to be proud of and many countries around the world look at the Premier League with admiration and envy .
" English football in general is in a very healthy state and those who simply knock it seem to be missing the point .
" I 'm sure Sir Elton would love to see Watford as a member of the Premier League , " he added .
John made a wide-ranging attack on the standard of play and the spiralling cost of transfers and wages in the Premiership .
" There are a few players worth 10 million pounds like Michael Owen or David Beckham but the whole thing has got to stop .
It is a joke that very mediocre players are now going for two million or three million , " he said .
" We want to seize the opportunity to bring Premiership football to Watford but we are not in a position to pay six million or seven million for players , nor do we want to .
" I 'm a very well-paid entertainer but when I see figures bandied around like 18 million for Alan Shearer it makes me laugh .
No disrespect to him but he has failed to find his form since returning from injury , including the World Cup .
" It is absolutely ridiculous and money for old rope .
Then you see the players ' attitudes - they are paid so much money and they are just strolling around the pitch , " he added .
The pop singer also accused England coach Glenn Hoddle of allowing petty jealousy to influence his handling of David Beckham .
He claimed Hoddle 's envy lay behind his treatment of the Manchester United star at the World Cup .
The Mirror quoted the rock star as saying : " Maybe there 's a bit of resentment on Glenn Hoddle 's part that David has a great career ahead of him .
Hoddle was a great player , but didn n't have a great England career .
" Beckham has a very famous , lovely girlfriend .
Maybe Hoddle resents that too . "
But he adds : " David has to learn about discipline on the field and he has got to try and rein that in .
Maybe Hoddle got that one right . "
