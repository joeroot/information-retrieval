Polar Seabed Core Recovered by Scientists
WELLINGTON , November 30 ( Xinhua ) -- Scientists , including a team of New Zealanders working on the Cape Roberts Project in Antarctica , have recovered a core of the sea floor that dates back 20 to 33 million years , a Wellington-based newspaper reported Monday .
The Dominion quoted the project 's chief scientist , Peter Barrett of Victoria University in Wellington , as saying that scientists working on the six-country , multi-million-dollar project are delighted with its progress .
Drillers had worked in sub-zero temperatures off Cape Roberts completing coring for the season at 624 meters below the sea floor , he said .
" It 's a credit to the 11 drillers and nine support staff who have worked around the clock in 12-hour shifts since mid-October , " he said .
The drillers had worked in unusually difficult conditions for several weeks before reaching firmer drilling and making spectacular progress in the final days , Professor Barrett said .
Electric logs were being run the full length of the hole to fully characterize the strata , he added .
The core is being studied by more than 50 scientists from Australia , Britain , Germany , Italy , New Zealand and the United States at laboratories at the drill site , base camp and McMurdo Station , according to the professor .
The core , he said , represents strata deposited on the sea floor at the edge of the Antarctic continent .
Sedimentary features in the core -- mud , sand and stones -- deposited from glaciers or floating ice , record the waxing and waning of ice sheets in the distant past when the earth 's average temperature was between three and four degrees Celsius warmer than at present , he said .
It is the project 's third attempt at drilling the hole , he said , adding that the team would produce an initial report on their findings before December 14 , and then return to their home countries .
