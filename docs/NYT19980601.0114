If there is one national issue emerging from the hodgepodge of political campaigns that will take shape with primary elections in eight states on Tuesday , it is health insurance .
Health maintenance organizations have taken over , and voters don n't like it .
So politicians are promising to do something about it .
Candidates this fall for the Senate and House as well as governor and state attorney general are rallying behind legislation percolating in Congress and in state legislatures that promises to force HMOs to pay for more care , to expand patient choice and to require health plans to document how well they treat patients .
Political marketing consultants have given these proposals a consumer-friendly name : the `` patients ' bill of rights '' _ an idea embraced last week by President Clinton and by his commission on managed care .
Patients ' rights have broad support among health policy experts who say they will make insurance companies accountable for the quality of care they provide .
But the experts also know something the politicians won n't say .
These bills of rights , the product of a consumer backlash against restrictions imposed by the HMOs , are almost certain to do the opposite of what consumers say they want .
Rather than expand consumer options , they will drive patients into restrictive types of HMOs that limit patients to a small roster of doctors .
The bills could also wipe out old-fashioned fee-for-service health insurance , which puts medical choices completely in the hands of doctors and patients .
The bills would tighten the grip of managed care because they impose elaborate record-keeping requirements on the health plans , aimed at making them publicly accountable for how well they prevent , treat and cure illness .
What the politicians won n't yet admit is that accountability clashes with something else something else patients prize : choice .
The more freedom patients have to choose doctors , the more difficult it becomes for plans to keep track of their doctors and remedy mistakes .
Accountability undermines choice .
Many experts say that is a bargain worth making .
But more choice , not less , is what politicians are promising .
The patients ' rights bills would demand substantial record-keeping .
Mary Nell Lehnhard , senior vice president of the association representing the country 's Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans , points to provisions in several bills and the report of President Clinton 's commission that would require plans to track medical treatments .
The language is vague ; the holes will be filled by regulatory agencies if the bills become law .
What the proponents have in mind is requiring health plans to reveal , for example , how many of its youngsters receive vaccinations , how many diabetics are checked for high blood pressure and how many coronary patients take beta blockers to prevent recurrent attacks .
Some of the bills go further , requiring plans to measure outcomes .
In practice , that might mean reporting the percentage of coronary patients who suffer continual chest pain or repeated heart attacks .
How many of the plan 's asthmatics return to normal work schedules without repeated visits to hospital emergency rooms ?
How many of the plan 's diabetics successfully control their blood pressure ?
The idea is that if every plan reports clear data on mortality , morbidity and patient satisfaction , consumers can reward the best plans with their business .
HMOs can handle demands for extensive data collection , typically by steering patients to a small roster of doctors and by using `` gatekeepers '' to intervene between patients and specialists .
Gatekeepers anger patients when they block access to doctors the patients want to see .
But gatekeepers serve two important functions .
They direct patients only to those specialists who practice medicine the way the plan thinks best .
They also provide the plan a single place to find any patient 's complete medical record .
That makes tracking outcomes possible .
By comparison , looser forms of managed care , like Preferred Provider Organizations , allow patients to see nearly any doctor , but require them to pay more for those who are not members of the plan .
The larger of these looser plans do business with tens of thousands of doctors and assign no gatekeepers .
There is no one place to find a patient 's complete record , so plans must sift through claims submissions to figure out which treatments their patients received .
Ms. Lehnhard says claims data only go so far .
They might show how many diabetics were tested for high blood pressure .
But claims data would not show how many of these diabetics had dangerously high blood pressure , or how many women succumbed to breast cancer because the disease was diagnosed late .
Ms. Lehnhard 's point is not that looser forms of managed care offer shoddy health care ; some have stellar quality improvement programs .
But , she says , managed care plans that are required to track the treatment of each customer will almost certainly choose to make the job easier by imposing some of the limitations that create frictions between HMOs and patients .
For example , the easiest way for plans to guarantee that each of its diabetics is checked for high blood pressure is to restrict enrollees to doctors the plan knows routinely perform the right tests .
And any problems that managed care plans face in tracking treatment outcomes would be that much worse for fee-for-service plans , which impose virtually no limits on where their enrollees seek treatment .
With little or no contractual relationship to doctors , fee-for-service plans can not possibly control the quality of care provided their members .
To meet the demands of patients ' rights legislation , they too would be forced to limit the number of doctors to choose from or to impose other restrictions .
Ms. Lehnhard fears such measures could enrage the 30 million or more enrollees in Blue Cross / Blue Shield who have avoided HMOs .
When legislators in Congress and elsewhere wake up to the tradeoff between accountability and choice , they will face unpleasant options .
They can insist that all plans track medical treatments and outcomes , but then patients will squawk when they find their loosely structured plans cracking down on physician choice .
Lawmakers could bend to pressure to exempt loosely structured plans from heavy data collection .
But that would put legislators in the embarrassing and contradictory position of imposing a regulatory burden only on HMOs , thereby punishing the only health plans equipped to give patients the data they need to make smart choices .
Lawmakers could instead drop accountability from health-care reform .
HMOs , it would reason , are already moving to reporting on medical outcomes without Congress ' shove .
Loosely structured plans , on the other hand , are in effect telling enrollees that they are on their own .
They , not the plan , are responsible for picking high-quality doctors .
The flaw in this argument is that individuals can not choose smart doctors if health plans neither collect nor report the data on which informed judgments would have to be made .
The dilemma is accountability versus choice .
Virtually everybody 's health care hinges on that conflict , yet nobody in politics is talking about it .
