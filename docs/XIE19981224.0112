KAMPALA , December 24 ( Xinhua ) -- Uganda and Nigeria signed bilateral initiatives here Wednesday to control the flow of illicit drug trafficking and to clamp down on related international money laundering , Uganda News Agency reported Thursday .
The signing of the co-operation agreement follows intensification of illicit drug traffickers using Uganda as transit point for smuggling narcotic drugs to Europe and north America .
At the signing ceremony , William Omaria , state minister of internal affairs , said between 1988 and 1998 , 20 Nigerians and 28 Ugandans attempted to smuggle 30 kg of heroin , eight kg of cocaine , 781,000 tablets of mandrax and 35 kg of cannabis resin through Uganda .
