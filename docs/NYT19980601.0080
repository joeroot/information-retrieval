ATLANTA _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer programs , with more than 1 million copies sold .
It is an excellent program , but my wife , Donna , the genealogist , believes much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs that come with the deluxe version .
Her report :
You get the Family Finder index ( a list of 130 million people who can be traced through birth , marriage , census and miscellaneous records ) ; the Social Security Death Index ( birth and death dates , Social Security number and last ZIP code for 54 million people ) ; and the World Family Tree ( 130 million people on family trees submitted by 27,000 family researchers ) .
Another 13 World Family Tree discs are available , 18 in all .
The newest version _ 4.4 _ comes with expanded online services .
You can search the Internet for every name in your file , add a Family Tree Maker book to your home page and take advantage of a free record lookup from Genealogy Research Associates .
Setting a home page was easy _ and free .
I included our immigrants by surname , where they settled , when they immigrated and where they came from .
Although you can have the `` agents '' on Family Tree Maker 's Web page search for every name in your file , there wasn n't much point to look for all our Elizabeths who were listed only by given name .
At FTM 's suggestion , I scaled my search down from 3,700 names to 185 .
I will be notified by e-mail when matches turn up .
Entering information is intuitive _ the family group screen includes information on both the husband and wife : birth , death and marriage dates , parents and children .
You can also include sources , notes and facts .
The program will help you print your book , and even check it for spelling .
You choose which reports you want to include and in what order .
You can even request a table of contents and index .
Most of FTM 's reports are excellent , but each time a new version comes out I have to figure out all over again how to print an ancestor tree with multiple pages .
Family Tree Maker lured me back into genealogy a couple of years ago .
I 've used it to gather , record and share information .
However , two other programs , Generations and Ultimate Family Tree , are also good .
Your choice pretty much comes down to which approach is right for you .
I would recommend Family Tree Maker ( about $ 90 ) for anyone whose primary interest is gathering material _ not only are the World Family Tree discs rich in information , but the publisher , Broderbund , offers another 100 databases of government and historical records .
Although much of the material on the World Family Tree needs to be verified , it will give you a starting point for your search .
Ultimate Family Tree 's premiere version is an ideal choice for anyone whose emphasis is on organization and verification , and a bargain at $ 60 .
The program not only lists sources but rates them : Is the source primary or secondary , and is there corroborating evidence ?
Finally , Generations should appeal to those who are interested in producing a book , and it 's also a bargain at $ 50 .
The reports are outstanding and intuitive ; I particularly like the fact that Generations saves reports in my word processor .
