& UR ; ( Distributed by New York Times Special Features ) & LR ; & QC ;
Brides and grooms get so much advice _ most of it wrong _ that they panic .
It 's like having a baby : As soon as people find out you 're expecting a wedding , they feel free to tell you what to do and give dire warnings about being improper _ i.e. , tacky .
Your mother is sure she knows what 's correct .
Your beloved 's mother has her own ideas , and your neighbor down the street can n't wait to tell you horror stories about the tacky weddings she 's attended .
You begin to feel queasy at the thought of `` Your Day . ''
Well , worry no more .
Here are the Top Ten Marriage Myths _ and the right answers , no matter what anyone says .
Folks will swear these myths are the eternal Etiquette Truth etched in stone and handed down by some Etiquette God .
Well , they aren n't .
1.
The bride and groom must ask their siblings to be bridesmaids and groomsmen .
Although it is customary to ask brothers and sisters to be attendants , the bride and groom are free to ask whomever they wish _ best friends , pals from the office , a buddy from a favorite bar .
But beware : This could be deadly .
Friends come and go , while your families are there forever .
You avoid a lot of hurt feelings by asking brothers and sisters .
Tacky brides wail , `` But I don n't feel close to his sisters .
I want my friends instead . ''
A wedding is a great place to get acquainted .
After the `` I do 's , '' those strangers will be your sisters , too .
2.
The bride must be escorted down the aisle and given away by someone .
Being given away is a tradition that evolved from the days when men bought brides from their fathers or , even worse , captured them .
Today many young women feel this custom is archaic .
Somehow it was charming when a woman went from her father 's home directly to her new husband 's , but that 's not true of most couples today .
With so many women going to college , supporting themselves and marrying later , being `` given away '' seems terribly out-of-date .
If you don n't want it , leave it out of the ceremony .
And if you choose , walk down the aisle by yourself .
Not every bride has a father , nor does every bride like her father .
Some brides say going solo made them feel like royalty .
3.
The bride 's father must sit in the first pew with the bride 's mother , even if they hate the sight of each other .
In a perfect world , divorced mothers and fathers would overcome their loathing so all could be sweetness and light on their child 's wedding day .
Let 's get real .
Divorce is a 1990s fact of life .
When divorced parents get along , it 's wonderful .
Mom and Dad can sit together , one big happy parental unit on the first pew .
This changes if stepparents are in the picture .
Mom _ and her new husband _ should sit in the first pew .
Dad _ and his new wife _ should sit in the next pew .
If they do not get along , Dad and his new wife should sit even farther back in the church _ far enough away to avoid bodily harm .
( All of this goes for the groom 's parents , too . )
4.
The number of groomsmen must equal the number of bridesmaids .
So who 's counting ?
Unlike many other areas of modern life , there is no rule that says a wedding party must have equality .
An equal number of men and women makes a pretty picture at the altar _ and makes life easier for the wedding consultant _ but this is not mandatory .
You can have all men , all women _ even all children if you like .
You don n't have to be politically correct at your wedding .
5.
A bride can not ask her mother to be the matron of honor .
If a father can be a best man , there is no reason a mother can n't be matron of honor .
It 's a beautiful , loving gesture .
The only drawback is if the wedding is a very large one .
The mother of the bride and the matron of honor each may have so many duties that it could be a burden to ask your mom to undertake both jobs .
But if a bride 's mom is extremely organized and is her best friend , she should ask her .
6.
A bride can not ask her mother to escort her down the aisle .
If a father can escort his daughter , there is no reason a mother can n't .
More and more brides are asking their moms to make the stroll down the aisle instead of bench-warming the first pew .
This custom is borrowed from Jewish ceremonies , where both parents escort the bride and groom .
It is a lovely gesture , and most moms are thrilled to be asked .
7.
A flower girl must be under age 6.
The littler they are , the cuter they are _ and the more they can disrupt your ceremony !
The same goes for ring bearers .
Flower girls have refused to go down the aisle or toss their petals .
One little ring bearer grabbed the flower girl 's basket , dumped the petals in a pile and began jumping on it .
And my mom loves to tell of when I was a flower girl : At a crucial moment in the ceremony , I stage-whispered , `` Mommy , I have to tee-tee . ''
The only criterion for the job of flower girl or ring bearer should be how important a child is to you .
If the little girl or little boy is someone you want to include , by all means do it , no matter how old _ or young _ the child is .
8.
Brides and grooms must pick attendants who are close to their own age .
No , the only requirement for being an attendant is a sincere attachment to the bride or groom _ and the ability to pay for the clothing .
I know of brides in their 20s who had bridesmaids in their 60s , and the weddings were full of love and rejoicing .
9.
A pregnant woman can not be a bridesmaid .
It is a mystery to me why it is considered poor manners to have a pregnant woman participate in a ceremony so full of fertility symbols .
Traditionally , bridesmaids were young women who surrounded the bride to confuse any evil spirits lurking about .
Perhaps a bridesmaid had to be fleet-footed , and it 's hard to run when you are pregnant .
I see no problems with asking a friend who is with child , other than logistical ones : She may have trouble fitting into her dress , and she may feel uncomfortable standing for long periods of time .
10 .
There can be only one maid of honor and one matron of honor .
A bride may have two of either if she wishes .
And she doesn n't have to limit herself to women .
If the bride 's best friend is a guy , she should ask him .
But she shouldn n't call him , as one Atlanta bride did , her `` mister of honor . ''
