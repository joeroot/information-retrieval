NEW YORK _ As they surveyed their outsized stock market gains over the past three years , some investors may have thought to wonder , on occasion , just what a bear market feels like .
Now they know .
In Wall Street 's second biggest one-day point decline , stocks of all kinds disintegrated Monday .
As a demise , it was orderly .
But it was also indiscriminate .
`` Today was really different , '' said Douglas Cliggott , U.S. equity strategist at J.P .
Morgan in New York .
`` Very high quality companies with no visible sign of earnings weakness were taken down brutally . ''
Indeed , the selling hammered stocks both in and out of favor with investors , both cyclical and noncyclical businesses , and both recognizable and obscure companies .
Monday was different in another way , however .
It marked the first time in years that the three most popular market indexes _ the Dow Jones industrial average , the Standard & AMP ; Poor 's 500 and the Nasdaq Composite _ showed losses .
Until now , the declines in the indexes , unpleasant though they were , had still left investors ahead of the game .
No longer .
Investors , playing with the house 's money all year , are now faced with the prospect of giving up some of their own .
Those who own index funds are now eating into last year 's gains .
There was no stopping the selling .
No circuit breakers to kick in on the New York Stock Exchange to give investors time to regain their reason before they resumed the furious unloading of shares .
Under the new rules instituted by the Exchange last October , it would take a fall of 900 points for trading to be halted .
No one expects a decline of that magnitude to happen .
Indeed , many strategists anticipate a rebound in stocks Tuesday .
Investors who had been moving their money into cash or money market funds , could easily decide that stocks at these levels look attractive .
Still , Monday 's action was a harrowing reminder to investors of how the law of gravity works in the stock market .
Shares of the same highfliers that had propelled the market to its triumphant heights led the decline .
Dell Computer closed down 15.2 percent , Yahoo !
ended the day 16.9 percent lower , America Online lost 14.8 percent of its value .
Those are breathtaking moves , one-day declines that might have taken months in other , less frothy markets .
What fueled the decline ?
Monday 's economic news wasn n't great , but it wasn n't awful either .
A report from Chicago 's National Association of Purchasing Management showed that increasing numbers of domestic manufacturers said their businesses were deteriorating .
And sales of new homes fell 1.6 percent in July , a signal that the housing market may be slowing .
Both reports contributed to the view that the U.S. economy is weakening .
Inasmuch as a weaker economy translates into diminished earnings , these figures were not welcome news to stock market investors .
Still , they were not triggers likely to cause the all-out collapse seen Monday .
What appeared to be happening Monday was the unwind of two significant investor behavioral patterns .
One was the shift from investors being able to shrug off all bad news , what Wall Street calls climbing the wall of worry , to investors showing increasing concern .
Maybe the economic problems in Asia , Russia and Latin America , combined with the strong dollar , will indeed have a deleterious effect on already weakening U.S. company earnings .
`` What we 're looking at here is a rolling realization that there are a lot of problems in the world , '' said Alan Kral , portfolio manager at Trevor , Stewart , Burton and Jacobsen , an investment management firm in New York .
`` The sum total of a number of small problems has become a major problem for us .
You can n't take away growth opportunities in half the world 's economies and blithely conclude that American stocks at 25 times earnings are cheap . ''

But an even greater contributor to Monday 's carnage , strategists say , was the reverse effect of what has come to be known as momentum investing .
This strategy , characterized by investors chasing stocks simply because they are rising in price , with little regard for sensible valuations , pushed shares of the favored companies to levels unseen before in even in the hottest of markets .
Now , with these stocks no longer rising and momentum shifting in the other direction , momentum investors sell .
And this selling feeds on itself .
`` When you 're buying something at a very high price / earnings ratio , '' said Peter Tanous , investment consultant at Lynx Asset Management in Washington D.C. `` You 've always got your finger on the trigger . ''
In choosing to pull that trigger , Monday , investors seemed to see several things on the horizon they didn n't like .
First were the whiffs of third quarter earnings disappointments , anecdotal only at this point , but a worry nonetheless .
Companies have learned to warn investors when prospects look grim ; the warning period for the third quarter begins in two weeks .
Neither have lower interest rates helped the market .
This is a turnabout for investors who have come to expect that when rates fall , stock prices rise .
An increasingly bearish sentiment among investment newsletter writers also may have contributed to Monday 's selling .
According to Mark Hulbert , editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest in Alexandria , Va. , at the end of July , newletter writers recommended on average that their readers maintain an exposure in stocks of 63 percent of their portfolio .
On Monday the recommended level had dropped to around 20 percent .
Still , Hulbert said that we are not yet seeing people really throwing in the towel .
`` Even though there has been a big drop , I thought we 'd have seen even more , '' he said `` We may not have quite the capitulation among advisers that a contrarian needs to see before calling a bottom . ''
Indeed , technology stocks , which led the market up , look particularly vulnerable to further declines .
That 's because now that Windows ' 98 is out in the stores , there are no new drivers to make investors want to got out and buy a new computer .
At the same time that there is a glut of product out there , consumer interest is down .
The stock market has been largely a confidence game of late , said Fred Hickey , editor of High Tech Strategist .
`` Since investors have been so certain about their stocks for so long , there 's a shock factor .
People have leveraged themselves , taken risks they shouldn n't have taken because these stocks seem so invincible .
You 're seeing a reversal of these excesses . ''
